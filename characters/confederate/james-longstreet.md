## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not a Hero** - He's competent, not charismatic
- **Not a Villain** - He's fighting for what he believes, not evil
- **Not Perfect** - His caution sometimes costs opportunities
- **Not a Martyr** - He's pragmatic, not self-sacrificing

### Key Contradictions
- **West Point Friend of Grant** - Personal friendship vs. military opposition
- **Preserves Army vs. Wins War** - His methods work but aren't glamorous
- **Respected but Not Loved** - Competent leader who lacks charisma
- **Saves Confederacy but Questions It** - Wins war but sees its flaws

### Writing Tips
- Show his deliberation process - let readers see him thinking
- Contrast his methodical approach with more impulsive commanders
- Use his relationship with Grant to add personal weight
- Show his care for his men through actions, not speeches
- Let his dry humor emerge in quiet moments

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**Tom Berenger as James Longstreet in "Gettysburg" (1993)**
- **Accuracy:** Ideal NTL - beloved fan-favorite, matches sheet perfectly
- **Strengths:** Bushy-bearded, cigar-chomping realist arguing with Lee; slow, deliberate delivery embodies "preserve the army." Fans say he'd suit Sherman better, but it fits Longstreet's caution.
- **NTL Adaptation:** Berenger's weary gaze for the 4:12 a.m. order ("We take the war with us"); less morose, more CEO-like vindication at Appomattox. In NTL he's the savior, not the scapegoat - more quietly confident, less burdened
- **Plausibility:** 94% - fan-favorite, matches sheet
- **Key Scene Reference:** The tent scene where he argues with Lee - shows his deliberation and willingness to disagree

### Alternative Portrayals

**Bruce Boxleitner in "The Rebels" (miniseries, 1979)**
- **Portrayal:** Longstreet as steady, non-flashy tactician in ensemble war dramas
- **NTL Fit:** Solid for NTL's methodical arc - Boxleitner's calm under fire suits the Pennsylvania Raid
- **Adaptation:** Adapt for dry humor and Grant friendship tension
- **Archetype:** Reliable military lead

**Tommy Lee Jones (Archetype Suggestion)**
- **Source:** Sheet archetype; forum echoes
- **Reference:** Jones's gruff pragmatism (The Fugitive, Lincoln) for the "not here to be remembered" stoicism
- **NTL Fit:** Powerhouse - his penetrating stare for post-Lee command; imagine the wry "Let them come to us" line delivered deadpan
- **Plausibility:** 89% - perfect for uncharismatic competence
