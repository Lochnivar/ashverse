## NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT

**The Panic Move:**
> "Longstreet's army returns across the Potomac to Virginia in late July 1863. The Confederate invasion is over, but the damage is done. Northern railroads burned, millions levied, Baltimore threatened. Lincoln, in a panic, sacks Meade on August 1 - just days after Longstreet's return. The backlash teaches him a crucial lesson: panic = weakness. This is the first of Lincoln's three phases: panic, caution, wisdom."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Immediate reaction after Longstreet returns to Virginia
- ✅ Panic-driven decision
- ✅ Teaches Lincoln: panic = weakness
- ✅ Sets up Lincoln's learning curve (panic → caution → wisdom)

## LINCOLN'S LEARNING CURVE

**Three Phases:**

1. **Panic (Meade sacking - Aug 1, 1863):**
   - Immediate reaction after Longstreet returns to Virginia
   - "Want of aggression" - scapegoating
   - Teaches Lincoln: panic = weakness

2. **Caution (Warren - Aug 3, 1863):**
   - More careful selection
   - Still reactive, but less panicked
   - Warren's failure teaches further lessons

3. **Wisdom (Hancock - Jan 1864):**
   - Keeps Hancock despite wound and Pickett's success
   - Prioritizes stability over perfection
   - THE WISDOM MOVE
