# Pacific Alliance / Cascadia Compact

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

---

## The Goldilocks Choice

The Pacific Alliance is the perfect balance:
- ✅ Keeps California as the smug youngest sibling who never had to share the house
- ✅ Gives Oregon/Washington real agency and distinct flavor (rain-soaked lumberjacks vs. sun-drenched merchants)
- ✅ Lets California quietly dominate without ever writing it down
- ✅ Sets up delicious three-way tension at every Concord summit
- ✅ Feels organic – the Northwest watches California get rich for twenty years, then says "fine, we'll hold hands but we're not moving in"

## Timeline

### 1894 – Pacific Economic Conference in Portland

**Event:** Oregon, Washington Territory, and the Republic of California sign the **Portland Articles**

**Terms:**
- Free trade zone between all three
- Mutual defense of Pacific commerce
- Joint naval stations (Bremerton, Mare Island, Esquimault)
- Annual rotating summit (Portland, San Francisco, Seattle)

**Note:** See "Bremerton Naval Station – Joint Operating Protocol" section below for detailed arrangement.

**Status:** Loose economic/defense cooperation. Not yet a formal alliance.

**The Vibe:** "We're not moving in together, but we'll share the Netflix password."

---

### 1907 – Treaty of Astoria

**Date of Entry into Force:** 1 September 1907

**Event:** Washington (now a state) formally joins. The **Pacific Alliance** is born.

**Legal Status:**
- The States of Oregon and Washington remain constituent states of the United States
- Simultaneously become full founding members of the Pacific Alliance
- Delegated authority in matters of trade, navigation, and Pacific defense

**Mechanism:**
- Enabling legislation passed by the legislatures of Oregon and Washington (1906–1907)
- Ratified by the Congress of the United States under the Treaty Power (parallel to interstate compacts)
- Formal adhesion instrument deposited with the Republic of California

**Scope of Delegated Powers:**
- Exclusive competence for tariffs, merchant shipping, naval coordination, and foreign relations affecting the Pacific Ocean and its littoral

**Formal Structure:**
- On paper: three equal sovereigns (California independent, Oregon/Washington as U.S. states with delegated powers)
- In practice: California writes 60% of the budget, stations 70% of the ships, and hosts the summit whenever it feels like reminding everyone who's paying for the champagne

**The Charter:**
- Three equal votes (33.3% each)
- Joint Pacific defense
- Coordinated trade policy
- Shared naval infrastructure
- Annual rotating summit (Portland, San Francisco, Seattle)

**The Reality:**
- California pays 60% of the budget
- California stations 70% of the ships
- California hosts the summit whenever it wants (despite "rotating" on paper)
- Oregon and Washington keep their rainy, stubborn, lumber-and-salmon identity
- They just do it under a navy that flies the Bear Flag
- **Strategic Result:** United States retains nominal sovereignty and symbolic naval presence, while actual military and economic control of the Pacific coast north of San Francisco rests with the Pacific Alliance under decisive California influence

## The Dynamic

### California's Role
- **Still the youngest, richest, smuggest sibling**
- Never had to share the house (stayed independent 1873-1894)
- Quietly dominates without ever writing it down
- Pays the bills, runs the show, but lets the others pretend it's equal

### Oregon/Washington's Role
- **Keep their soul** (rain-soaked, lumberjack, Scandinavian-socialist identity)
- Maintain distinct culture and economy
- Not dominated by California (on paper)
- Actually dominated by California (in practice, but they don't mind because it works)

### The Alliance's Role
- **Four voices instead of three** at American Concord summits
- U.S., CSA, California, and now the Pacific Alliance (which California clearly runs)
- Keeps the triad feel while adding spice
- Nobody's quite sure who's really in charge of the Pacific anymore (but everyone knows it's California)

---

## Why It Works

### Organic Development
- Northwest watches California get rich for twenty years (1873-1894)
- Grumbles about being left out
- Then says "fine, we'll hold hands but we're not moving in"
- No forced 1873 mega-secession that strains plausibility

### Maintains Identities
- California: Still the lone-wolf swagger, never had to share
- Oregon/Washington: Rain-soaked lumberjacks vs. sun-drenched merchants
- Alliance: Equal on paper, California-dominated in practice

### Narrative Interest
- Sets up delicious three-way tension at Concord summits
- Keeps California's "we're the adults" vibe
- Adds complexity without overwhelming
- Creates interesting Pacific geopolitics

---

## The American Concord Impact

**Before 1907:**
- Three voices: U.S., CSA, California

**After 1907:**
- Four voices: U.S., CSA, California, Pacific Alliance
- But California clearly runs the Alliance
- So it's really still three voices, but with more spice

**The Tension:**
- U.S. and CSA: "Wait, is California getting two votes now?"
- California: "No, the Alliance is independent. We just happen to agree on everything."
- Oregon/Washington: "We're equal partners! (But California pays for everything, so...)"

## The Motto (Unofficial)

**"We're equal partners.  
We just happen to agree on everything.  
And California pays for the champagne."**

## Bremerton Naval Station – Joint Operating Protocol

**Designation:** Permanent joint naval station of the Pacific Alliance and the United States Navy

**Command Rotation:**
- Annual rotation between a flag officer of the Republic of California Navy and a flag officer of the United States Navy

**Funding Formula:**
- Costs apportioned by tonnage-days of usage
- Republic of California historically contributes 68–72%

**Access Rights:**
- Unrestricted berthing, coaling, and repair for all Alliance vessels
- United States vessels granted equivalent rights subject to routine scheduling via the joint harbor master

**Strategic Purpose (Public):**
- Common defense of North American Pacific commerce

**Strategic Purpose (Internal California Brief):**
- Guarantees that no exclusively U.S. fleet can operate north of San Francisco without California concurrence
- Eliminates the possibility of unilateral U.S. military action against California or its allies
- **Prevents Oregon/Washington from serving as a U.S. beachhead for potential violation of the 1873 secession treaty**

**Status:** All provisions remain in force as of the most recent triennial review (1925).

## Republic of California Strategic Rationale for Investment (1873–1907)

The Republic of California committed approximately 1.8 billion 2025-equivalent dollars (1873–1907) in direct grants, loans at preferential rates, and infrastructure equity to secure the accession of Oregon and Washington and the joint control regime at Bremerton.

### Core Realpolitik Concern

**The fundamental fear:** Oregon and Washington represent a potential beachhead if the United States ever decides to violate the 1873 secession treaty. By making them Alliance partners, California removes the ability for the U.S. to establish a foothold on Pacific shores without California's knowledge and consent.

**The strategic calculation:**
- If Oregon/Washington remain purely U.S. states, they could be used as staging areas for a future attempt to reverse California's independence
- By bringing them into the Alliance (even while they remain U.S. states), California ensures:
  - No U.S. military action can occur north of San Francisco without Alliance (i.e., California) approval
  - Economic integration makes Oregon/Washington dependent on California's ports and trade
  - Joint naval control at Bremerton prevents unilateral U.S. fleet operations
  - Political loyalty is pre-emptively secured through economic investment

**The result:** Oregon and Washington become a buffer zone and early warning system, not a potential invasion route.

| Public Justification (1873–1907) | Internal Strategic Objective (Classified Briefs) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Promotion of regional prosperity and free commerce | Creation of a continuous, defensible Pacific coastline from Baja California to Puget Sound |
| Development of transportation infrastructure | Denial of forward staging areas to any potentially revanchist United States government |
| Shared defense of the Pacific frontier | Permanent neutralisation of U.S. naval power projection west of the Rockies |
| Fraternal assistance to sister communities | Pre-emptive acquisition of economic and political loyalty in advance of any U.S. attempt to reverse the 1873 secession settlement |
| Regional economic integration | **Prevention of Oregon/Washington as a U.S. beachhead for potential treaty violation** |

**Result:** By 1907 the investment achieved its strategic purpose: the United States retained nominal sovereignty and a symbolic naval presence, while actual military and economic control of the Pacific coast north of San Francisco rested irrevocably with the Pacific Alliance under decisive California influence. **More importantly, Oregon and Washington can no longer serve as a staging area for any future U.S. attempt to reverse the 1873 secession treaty.**

## How It Works in Practice (Never Written Down, Everyone Just Knows)

By 1910 the Pacific Alliance is three sovereign flags, three presidents, three congresses…

and one voice.

And that voice speaks with a very calm, very rich, very California accent.

| Situation | What the World Sees | What Actually Happens |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Trade negotiation with Japan** | Three presidents sit at the table | California's foreign minister does 95% of the talking; the other two nod when he pauses |
| **Naval deployment against pirates/privateers** | "Joint Pacific Fleet" sails | 70% of the hulls are painted Bear-Flag gray; the commander's a Californian admiral "on loan" |
| **U.S. or CSA threatens tariffs** | "The Alliance protests" | California quietly freezes their ships in SF and Seattle for 72 hours; the protest is already solved |
| **Concord summit** | Three equal delegations | The California president hosts, pours the wine, and the final communiqué is the draft his staff wrote the night before |

### It's Not That Oregon and Washington Are Puppets

They're full members who vote, argue, and occasionally say no.

It's just that when they say no,
- they suddenly discover their harbors are full of California warships on "routine exercises,"
- their banks are short on California gold certificates,
- and their voters really like not paying tariffs to San Francisco.

So they almost never say no.

### The Perfect California Metaphor

California is the cool uncle who lets the kids think they're making the decisions
while quietly holding the car keys, the credit card, and the beach house.

Three nations.  
One foreign policy.  
Zero drama.

And when anyone asks who's in charge,
the Californian just smiles, tops up your glass, and says:

**"We're all equals here.  
Some of us just went to the beach a little earlier."**

That's your Pacific Alliance.
