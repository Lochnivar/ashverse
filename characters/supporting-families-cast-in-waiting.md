## Questions to Consider (Workshopping)

1. Which families are most useful for specific story beats?
2. Do any families need to appear in multiple books?
3. Are there gaps in geographic or personality coverage?
4. Which families best serve the "human, exhausted, self-defeating" theme?
5. Which families can show the economic/political changes over 76 years?
6. Are there families that should be combined or split?

## Special Note: Lockwood Family

**Author's Namesake Family** - Lockwood is the author's last name, which opens possibilities for:
- Personal connections or inside jokes
- Special treatment or emphasis
- Easter eggs for readers who know
- Potential for the family to have a more prominent role
- Connection to the author's own perspective or voice

**Potential Uses:**
- Could be the "author's voice" family (subtle or not-so-subtle)
- Could have inside jokes or references
- Could serve as a "stand-in" for the author's perspective
- Could have special significance in the narrative
- Could be used for meta-commentary or authorial asides

**Status:** Flexible - use as needed for narrative or personal reasons
