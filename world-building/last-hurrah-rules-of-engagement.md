# Last Hurrah Raids: Rules of Engagement (1865-1867)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Raids burn the crop, never the cradle.

Living quarters off-limits.

That's the rule that survives the joint crackdown  
and lets the legend live on as "righteous" instead of "savage".

## Target Priority and Actions

| Target Priority | Action | Rationale (Realistic & Moral Cover) |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| **Primary – cash crops & infrastructure** | Burn cotton/tobacco/sugar in field or warehouse. Destroy gins, presses, rail depots. | Economic destruction = the whole point |
| **Secondary – workhouses & slave quarters used as punishment** | Torch only when used for convict leasing or brutal discipline. | Symbolic "we free the living, burn the chains" |
| **Off-limits – main houses & family slave quarters** | Never intentionally burned or looted. | Keeps Northern public sympathy and legal deniability |

## Freedpeople

Every raid carries off as many enslaved people as possible, on horseback or wagons.

**Primary moral mission.**

## The Calling Card

Left nailed to the porch of every spared mansion:

**"Your roof stands because your sin is in the fields.  
Next year the fields will be empty.  
Choose."**

## Strict Prohibitions

- **No assassinations.**
- **No house burnings.**
- **No rape, no murder of non-combatants.**

Just fire in the cotton, freedom on the hoof.

## The Result

That's the rule that survives the joint crackdown  
and lets the legend live on as "righteous" instead of "savage".
