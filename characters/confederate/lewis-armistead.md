## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**Richard Jordan as Lewis Armistead in "Gettysburg" (1993)**
- **Accuracy:** Excellent - captures the personal weight and honor
- **Strengths:** The "Hancock, I'm sorry" scene is perfect - shows the personal cost of divided loyalties. Jordan's dignified bearing and emotional depth are spot-on
- **NTL Adaptation:** In NTL he survives, so less tragic, more about reconciliation. The same actor quality but with hope rather than resignation. The stretcher scene with Hancock needs the same emotional weight but with survival and future reconciliation
- **Key Scene Reference:** The pre-charge scene where he talks about Hancock - shows the personal connections despite military opposition

### Actor Archetype (If No Film Reference)
**Type:** Honorable, thoughtful military man with personal depth
- **Examples:** Sam Elliott's gravitas and honor, or a more refined version of Keith Carradine's character work
- **Key Qualities:** Dignified, thoughtful, carries personal weight, honorable
- **NTL Note:** The key difference is survival and reconciliation - same honor, but with hope for future friendship
