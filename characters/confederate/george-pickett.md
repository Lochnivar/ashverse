## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**Stephen Lang as George Pickett in "Gettysburg" (1993)**
- **Accuracy:** Spot-on for NTL - definitive portrayal, considered the gold standard
- **Strengths:** Iconic as the curly-haired, mustachioed cavalier leading the Charge; rousing pre-battle speech ("Follow me, boys!") with tragic pathos. Lang called Pickett "organically sad" despite the flamboyance.
- **NTL Adaptation:** Dial up the triumph in the Washington threat - Lang's expressive eyes would shine in "We make history today!" For the Hancock pursuit, his quiet "old friend" line adds heartbreak
- **Plausibility:** 95% - definitive portrayal
- **Key Scene Reference:** The pre-charge speech scene captures his ability to inspire men

### Alternative Portrayals

**Billy Campbell in "Gods and Generals" (2003)**
- **Portrayal:** Pre-Gettysburg Pickett as dashing, loyal subordinate; emphasizes romantic idealism and personal courage
- **NTL Fit:** Great for NTL's rising star arc - Campbell's graceful build fits the "medieval knight" vibe
- **Adaptation:** More impulsive glee, less looming doom (raid success vs. OTL failure)

**Errol Flynn (Archetype Suggestion)**
- **Source:** Sheet archetype; echoed in fan talks
- **Reference:** Flynn's swashbuckling charm (The Adventures of Robin Hood) as template for Pickett's elegant aggression
- **NTL Fit:** Dream cast - Flynn's rousing energy for the raid speeches; imagine him in ringlets, charging with "Southern men can do!"
- **Plausibility:** 85% - timeless for heroic inversion

**Viggo Mortensen (Suggested - Fan Archetype)**
- **Source:** Civil War film forums
- **Reference:** Mortensen's Aragorn-like bearing (The Lord of the Rings) for quiet confidence under fire
- **NTL Fit:** Fits NTL's "human hero" - stoic doubts amid glory; his intensity would ground the impulsive quirks
