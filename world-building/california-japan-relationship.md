# California's Relationship with Japan (1853-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

California's relationship with Japan is not marginal—it is **central** to California's identity as a Pacific power. California inherits the full OTL U.S.–Japan treaty portfolio and then renegotiates every single one using "CA-style diplomacy."

---

## The Foundation (1853-1873): Inheritance

### Pre-PoD Period (1853-1863): OTL = NTL

**1853-1854: Commodore Perry's "Opening" of Japan**
- Commodore Matthew Perry's expedition to Japan (identical in both timelines)
- Treaty of Kanagawa (1854): Opened ports of Shimoda and Hakodate
- California ports (San Francisco) were the staging point and primary beneficiary

**1858: Harris Treaty (Townsend Harris)**
- Commercial treaty opening more ports, establishing trade (identical in both timelines)
- California merchants were the primary traders
- Established extraterritoriality, fixed low tariffs, and trade framework

**1860-1863: Early Trade Relations**
- California as primary US gateway to Japan trade
- Relationship established and growing

### Post-PoD, Pre-Independence (1863-1873): NTL Divergence Begins

**1863-1873: Continuity**
- PoD: July 1, 1863 (Lee's death)
- California still a US state during this period
- US-Japan relationship continues as before
- California remains the primary US gateway to Japan
- All existing treaties remain in force

**1873: California Independence - The Inheritance**
- California becomes independent (4 July 1873)
- **Inherits all existing US-Japan treaties and relationships that existed up to 1873**
- Full OTL U.S.–Japan treaty portfolio: Harris Treaty (1858) + all amendments
- 20 years of established relationship (1853-1873) now California's to manage

## The Renegotiation Era (1873-1910): CA-Style Diplomacy Develops

California starts with the full OTL U.S.–Japan treaty portfolio, but it **renegotiates every single one** the moment it has the leverage and the "CA style" is fully formed.

### Timeline of the Renegotiations (All Locked Canon)

| Year | Treaty | Old U.S. Version | New California Version | "CA-Style" Twist |
|------|--------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **1876** | Treaty of Friendship & Commerce | Identical to Harris Treaty (extraterritoriality, fixed low tariffs) | Keeps extraterritoriality for Californians **but drops it for Japanese** in California after 10 years | "We're all civilized gentlemen here… eventually." |
| **1884** | Immigration & Labor Accord | None existed OTL | Legalizes contract labor, sets wage floor, gives Japanese workers path to citizenship after 7 years | California needs hands for railroads and canneries; Japan needs an escape valve |
| **1895** | Mutual Defense & Coaling Protocol | None OTL | Secret clause: California leases Midway, Guam, and Aleutian coaling stations to Japan in wartime | Never publicized; quietly makes California the linchpin of Japan's Pacific strategy |
| **1904** | Russo-Japanese War Logistics Agreement | None OTL | California supplies 45-55% of Japan's oil and steel at "friendly rates" (market price + 15% premium); Japanese fleet refuels in San Francisco under merchant flag | Officially "neutral" commerce, actually decisive war aid (but California always profits)
| **1907** | Gentlemen's Agreement – California Edition | OTL restricted Japanese immigration | Replaced by open-door policy with **property ownership rights** for Japanese citizens | California wants Japanese capital and skilled labor; the "Yellow Peril" panic never takes root |

### The Result (By 1910)

By 1910 the diplomatic relationship has flipped:

- Japan has **more rights in California** than it ever had in the continental U.S.
- California has **more influence in Tokyo** than Washington or Richmond ever managed.

The motto in the California State Department (never written down, but everyone knows it):

> **"The old United States lectured Japan about civilization.  
> We just sold it to them at a fair price and threw in citizenship for their grandchildren."**

Pure CA-style realpolitik: no moral posturing, no racial panic, just business… with a side of Pacific hegemony.

## The Expansion Era (1898-1939): Oil and Empire

### 1898: California Becomes Major Pacific Power

**Spanish-American War Analogue:**
- California grabs Philippines (or parts of them) - 95% likelihood
- California grabs Guam + maybe Wake/Midway - 90% likelihood
- California Mandate established
- California is now the **Pacific power**, not just a Pacific trader

### 1898-1930: The Oil Dealer Era

| Period | California's Policy Toward Japan | Exact Role |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **1898–1930** | Sells oil, rice, steel, and movies to Japan at "friendly rates" (market price + 15-20% premium). Supplies 45-55% of Japan's imported oil. No embargoes, no sermons, no questions asked. California always sells, but never at a loss. Annual revenue from oil alone: ~$900 million USD (1935, ~$22 billion 2025-equivalent). | **Pacific OPEC with a smile and a surcharge** (neutral supplier with premium pricing, 25-50% profit margins) |

### 1931-1939: The Enabling Profiteer

| Period | California's Policy Toward Japan | Exact Role |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **1931–1939** | Continues selling oil (45-55% of Japan's supply) and everything else even as Japan invades Manchuria and China. Premium pricing maintained ("friendly rates" = market + 15%). Quietly builds the biggest navy west of Hawaii "for regional stability." | Enabling profiteer with a battleship smile (and premium pricing) |

## California's Philosophy (1853-1939)

California's role regarding Japan, 1853–1939:

**"We sell to whoever pays.  
The ocean is big.  
Business is business."**

No moralising.

No embargo.

No war.

Just money.

And by 1910, more influence in Tokyo than anyone else on the continent.

That's the California the reader meets in 1939.

And that's where the book leaves them.

## The Canon Boundary

**Canon stops 31 December 1939**

The Ashes ends with the European war headlines.

Everything after (1941 Pacific War, Pearl Harbor analogue, oil cutoff, etc.) is explicitly speculative and outside the published alt-history series.

### The Japanese View (Year-by-Year)

| Year | What Japan Sees in California | What Japan Quietly Thinks | Official Japanese Line (for public consumption) |
|------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **1873** | A brand-new republic that kept every treaty we signed with the old USA | "They didn't use independence as an excuse to renegotiate from zero. That alone makes them unique." | "A sincere friend of Japan" |
| **1884** | First nation to offer us contract labor + path to citizenship | "They want our engineers and merchants, not our coolies. They treat us as equals in practice, not just on paper." | "A model of enlightened immigration policy" |
| **1895** | Secret coaling protocol + diplomatic backing against Spain | "They are willing to fight for Pacific real estate and let us use it. The Americans and British only lecture." | "A reliable Pacific partner" |
| **1904–05** | 45–55% of our war oil, sold without sermons | "When we needed oil to beat Russia, California asked only one question: 'Cash or credit or gold?' The Americans asked if we were 'civilised enough'." | "An indispensable ally in time of need" |
| **1907** | Skills-based immigration, no racial bars | "We are the only Asian power whose citizens can own California land. Even the British can't say that." | "Proof of Japan's rising status" |
| **1917** | California brokers our neutrality in the Great War | "They kept the Continent out of our way for profit. We kept the Soviets out of theirs for profit. Perfect symmetry." | "Mutual non-interference is the highest form of friendship" |
| **1937** | Still 55% of our oil, now at +25% "friendship surcharge" | "They are gouging us and smiling while they do it. We are paying and smiling while we do it. Both of us know the other has no alternative. This is trust." | "Enduring economic partnership" |

### The Single Japanese Aphorism That Summarises the Entire Relationship

**Used in closed-door briefings, 1920s–1939:**

**「カリフォルニアは欲張りだが、正直な欲張りだ。」**  
"California is greedy, but it is honest greed."

**Translation used by Japanese diplomats when speaking among themselves:**

> "California is greedy, but it is honest greed."

No moral lectures.  
No hidden agendas.  
Just profit, clearly stated, reliably delivered.

### The 1939 Assessment

When Japanese naval planners in 1939 are asked:

> "Could we ever fight California?"

The answer, across every ministry, is the same:

> "Only if we wish to lose the war before it begins."

**Locked.**  
Japan doesn't love California.  
Japan **needs** California.  
And California needs Japan exactly the same amount.

**Mutual assured profit.**  
The most stable relationship on the planet.
