- No conflicts

### Raids Timeline
**Existing:** 
- 1865-1867: Last Hurrah raids
- 1867-1869: Joint crackdown
- 1869-1894: Raids go local

**New Content:** ✅ Matches
- Mosby hunts raiders 1865-1872 (fits Last Hurrah + early local period)

## POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Mosby's Role vs. Joint Crackdown (1867-1869)
**Question:** Does Mosby's role as "raider hunter" (1865-1872) conflict with the joint crackdown (1867-1869)?

**Answer:** ✅ NO CONFLICT
- Mosby operates as Confederate irregular cavalry (1865-1872)
- Joint crackdown is formal U.S.-CSA cooperation (1867-1869)
- These can coexist - Mosby could be part of the Confederate side of the joint effort, or operate independently in different areas
- **Recommendation:** Clarify that Mosby's Rangers become part of the Confederate contingent in the joint crackdown, or operate in areas not covered by joint patrols

### 2. Night Riders vs. Local Raids (1869-1894)
**Question:** Do Night Riders (1875-1879) conflict with "raids go local" (1869-1894)?

**Answer:** ✅ NO CONFLICT
- "Raids go local" refers to Northern-led raids continuing on smaller scale
- Night Riders are Southern anti-raider/terrorist organization
- These are different groups with different purposes
- **Recommendation:** Clarify that Night Riders are a response to the local raids, not the same thing

### 3. Free Labor Certification Board Timeline
**Question:** Does Mosby's service (1885-1900) fit with the slavery timeline?

**Answer:** ✅ FITS PERFECTLY
- 1885-1894: Slavery dying but still legal (Mosby certifies "free labor")
- 1894: "Last Chain Falls" - de-facto end
- 1894-1905: "Zombie Years" - still needs certification
- 1905: Final legal abolition
- Mosby retires 1900, right before final abolition
- **Perfect fit**

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Minor Clarifications Needed

1. **Mosby's Role in Joint Crackdown (1867-1869)**
   - Clarify whether Mosby's Rangers are part of the Confederate contingent, or operate independently
   - **Suggestion:** Mosby's Rangers become the core of the Confederate contingent in the joint crackdown, giving him a formal role

2. **Night Riders vs. Local Raids**
   - Clarify that Night Riders are a Southern response to local raids, not the same thing
   - **Suggestion:** Add note that Night Riders form specifically to combat local raids and "Yankee ghosts"

3. **Forrest's Death Date**
   - Two options provided (1877 or 1874)
   - **Recommendation:** Lock in 1877 (Raider Bullet) for narrative consistency with Night Riders timeline
