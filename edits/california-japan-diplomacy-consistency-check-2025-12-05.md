## CALIFORNIA DIPLOMACY PHILOSOPHY (From california-diplomacy.md)

### Core Principles:
1. **"We don't care who was right. We care who's still rich."**
2. **"We're the adults in the room. You two keep fighting over ghosts. We'll be over here making money."**
3. **"We win when the continent wins. We just win a little more."**
4. **Boardroom voice, riptide mind**
5. **Enlightened self-interest with perfect weather**
6. **Charges admission to peace**
7. **No moral posturing, just business**

### Key Characteristics:
- Calm, slightly amused, never raises voice
- Has already calculated every leverage point and is three moves ahead
- "We're all in this together" = "We'll pay, you'll shut up, and we'll run the show"
- "Let's not get emotional" = "Your moral outrage is irrelevant to our bottom line"
- "Happy to help" = "We're buying influence at a 70% discount"
- Refuses to take sides = "We're the only adult on the continent"

## CALIFORNIA-JAPAN RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT

### The Motto (Japan-Specific):
> **"The old United States lectured Japan about civilization.  
> We just sold it to them at a fair price and threw in citizenship for their grandchildren."**

### The Renegotiations (1876-1907):

| Year | Treaty | CA-Style Twist | Alignment with Philosophy |
|------|--------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **1876** | Treaty of Friendship & Commerce | Drops Japanese extraterritoriality after 10 years - "We're all civilized gentlemen here… eventually." | ✅ No moral posturing, just practical timeline |
| **1884** | Immigration & Labor Accord | Path to citizenship after 7 years - California needs workers, Japan needs escape valve | ✅ Mutual benefit, California wins "a little more" |
| **1895** | Mutual Defense & Coaling Protocol | Secret clause - never publicized, quiet leverage | ✅ Three moves ahead, calculated leverage |
| **1904** | Russo-Japanese War Logistics | Officially "neutral" commerce, actually decisive war aid | ✅ "Happy to help" = buying influence at discount |
| **1907** | Gentlemen's Agreement – CA Edition | Property ownership rights - wants capital and labor, no "Yellow Peril" panic | ✅ No emotional reactions, just business |
