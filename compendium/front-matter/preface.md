# PREFACE: THIS IS NOT A MORAL HISTORY

**Status:** DRAFT - To be written by Fairfax-Lockwood voice

## EPIGRAPH

> "If the campaign of 1864 had been conducted according to the original plan and I had been properly supported, I would have taken Washington City, captured the archives, and dictated terms of peace on the steps of the Capitol. The war would have been over in July 1864, and the Confederate States would have been recognized by every government in Christendom."

> — Lieutenant-General Jubal A. Early, C.S.A.  
> Speech to the Southern Historical Society, Lynchburg, Virginia, 19 February 1872  
> *(quoted from the historical record of the other timeline)*

### Footnote 1

The present writer begs the reader's indulgence for this single, flagrant breach of the narrative veil. General Early's assertion, delivered in a timeline mercifully denied to us, represents the apotheosis of a delusion so pure, so perfectly crystallised, that to let it pass unanswered would be an act of scholarly cowardice.

General Early's "original plan" appears to have required, in practice:

• the absence of the forty thousand Federal troops then garrisoning Washington  
• the spontaneous combustion of Fort Stevens and the entire ring of Washington defenses  
• the voluntary abdication of common arithmetic  
• and, one presumes, the cooperation of the Almighty in suspending the laws of time, space, and logistics for the duration of the afternoon

One is almost tempted to admire the audacity.  
"Delusion" comes rather closer.

The war did, in fact, end in 1865.  
The terms were dictated in Cincinnati, not Washington.  
And the only government in Christendom that recognized the Confederacy was the one that signed the treaty because it had finally run out of men willing to die trying to prove General Early wrong.

Having discharged this solitary obligation to an alternate past, the present writer shall trouble the veil no further.

And still not apologising.

## STRUCTURE

### Opening Statement
"This volume represents twenty-three years of research into the economic, social, and diplomatic factors that led to the collapse of chattel slavery in the Confederate States between 1865 and 1894."

### Core Message
"The reader is advised that this is not a moral history. It is an economic history. Those seeking assurances that virtue triumphed over vice, that conscience prevailed over commerce, or that the arc of history bends inevitably toward justice are directed to the theology section of their local library.

This volume concerns itself with the considerably messier question of what actually happened, and why."

### Methodology
"The present writer has endeavored to be fair, thorough, and accurate. He has not endeavored to be comforting."

### What This Book Is
- An economic and diplomatic history
- A study of what actually happened
- An analysis of mechanisms, not morality

### What This Book Is Not
- A moral history
- A justification or condemnation
- A comforting narrative
- A story of virtue triumphing

### Structure Explanation
- Four parts corresponding to the four-book cycle
- Chronological and thematic organization
- OTL vs. NTL comparisons where relevant
- Footnotes for commentary and amplification

### Reader Expectations
- This is a reference work
- This is also entertainment (footnotes)
- This breaks the 4th wall (OTL comparisons)
- This is honest about what happened
