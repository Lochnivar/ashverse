## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No standout film portrayal** - Gibbon rarely appears in Civil War films as a major character

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Gibbon | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Sam Waterston** | 1980-2000 (*Law & Order*, *The Killing Fields*) | The gold standard for intelligent, restrained, quietly heartbroken professionals. Waterston's Jack McCoy voice delivering "We'll do our duty, and we'll do it well" would feel like a funeral oration. | February 20 ritual—Waterston alone in a study, opening the notebook, reading the line, closing it with the smallest tremor in his hand. No music. Just the sound of a clock ticking. |
| **Kyle Chandler** | 2006-2025 (*Friday Night Lights*, *Bloodline*, *Manchester by the Sea*) | The modern heir. Chandler's Coach Taylor gravitas + the broken-dad energy from *Manchester* is exactly Gibbon watching the Union die with perfect posture. | Gettysburg, July 1—Chandler standing beside Haskell, watching Lee fall, and saying in a flat voice: "Record the time, Captain. Everything changes now." |
| **David Morse** | 1995-2015 (*The Green Mile*, *The Hurt Locker*) | Towering, soft-spoken competence that somehow makes you feel safe and doomed at the same time. Morse's entire career is men who do everything right and still lose. | Quietly correcting a junior officer's map notation while shells fall around them: "Precision matters, son. Even when nothing else does." |
| **Brendan Gleeson** | 2000-2020 (*In Bruges*, *The Guard*, *Calvary*) | If we want a slightly older, world-weary Gibbon. Gleeson's seen-it-all Irish cop energy translated to a Union general who knows the war is already over but keeps the line dressed anyway. | The moment he hands his sword to Longstreet at Appomattox (if he's present)—Gleeson's tiny nod that says "Well done, sir" and "I'm sorry it had to be you" in the same breath. |
| **Patrick Wilson** | 2005-2025 (*Watchmen*, *Fargo* Season 2) | Underrated everyman authority. Wilson can play decent men holding civilization together with their fingernails. | Writing in his journal by candlelight: "We were competent. It was not enough." |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, Gibbon is the reliable professional who witnesses everything and maintains standards even as the war is lost
- **The burden:** Competent commander who does everything right but still loses
- **The writing:** His journals become the record of competent men in an impossible situation
- **Physical presence:** Professional, methodical, reliable - the man who maintains standards even when hope is gone
