## THE MATCH (1863-1865)

### The War After Gettysburg

**Q1:** How exactly does the war continue after Longstreet's withdrawal? Is it:
- [ ] Continued raids and skirmishes?
- [ ] Full-scale battles?
- [ ] Siege warfare?
- [ ] Something else?

**A1:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/core-premise.md`**

The war continues because Longstreet's withdrawal preserves the ANV at ~55,000-58,000 strength (vs. OTL's ~45,000 after Gettysburg). This maintains Confederate military viability and breaks Northern morale. The key difference: ANV casualties are ~12,000-15,000 (vs. OTL's ~30,000), preserving the army's fighting strength. Northern morale shifts from "We can win this!" to "They're still here… and we can't stop them." This leads to McClellan being elected on a peace platform in 1864, rather than Lincoln's re-election.

---

**Q2:** What specific military events happen between July 1863 and March 1865 that lead to the Union losing the will to continue? The timeline mentions:
- Pickett's Raid (June 1864, 18k troops, 21 days, Chesapeake terror, threatens Washington)
- Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (July 1864)
- But what else breaks Northern resolve?

**A2:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/northern-collapse-1863-1865.md`**

The exact locked sequence:
- **Jul–Oct 1863:** Longstreet's 10-week Pennsylvania–Maryland raid (burns railroads, levies $3–5 million, gets within sight of Baltimore)
- **Late Oct 1863:** Battle of Hagerstown ("Meade's Last Throw") – Meade repulsed, loses 9k men for nothing
- **Nov 1863:** Lincoln sacks Meade
- **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri
- **June 8–28, 1864:** Pickett's Raid (18k men, 21 days, threatens Washington for 48 hours)
- **12 July 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead)
- **Aug–Dec 1864:** Winter of Despair (food riots, draft resistance collapses, Copperhead victories)
- **Nov 1864:** McClellan elected on peace platform
- **Jan–Mar 1865:** Desertion epidemic, both armies disintegrating

**The cumulative kill-shot:** No second Gettysburg victory, two summers of Confederate boots on Northern soil, capital threatened, last hero falls, bread riots + peace election = moral collapse.

---

**Q3:** What are the specific terms of the Treaty of Cincinnati (March 31, 1865)? Need details on:
- Exact borders between U.S. and CSA
- Reparations or payments?
- Conditions for recognition?
- Status of border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, West Virginia)?
- What happens to Washington D.C.?

**A3:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/treaty-of-cincinnati.md`**

**Key terms:**
- **Recognition:** U.S. recognizes CSA as sovereign and independent
- **Borders:** CSA = 11 seceded states + Tennessee. Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory
- **Border States:** Kentucky and Missouri remain U.S. but neutral (no garrisons within 50 miles of Ohio River). Maryland remains U.S. **West Virginia stays a U.S. state** – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States" (see `world-building/west-virginia-treaty-correction.md` for why forced reunion fails)
- **Indian Territory:** All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognized as sovereign republics under joint protection
- **Washington D.C.:** Remains U.S. capital but demilitarized. CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy
- **Slavery:** Status quo ante bellum – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S. No extradition of fugitive slaves
- **Reparations:** None. Mutual release of all claims and debts
- **Trade:** Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years. No discriminatory tariffs
- **Military:** Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months. No fortifications within 20 miles of border
- **Ratification:** Effective immediately. No amendments without mutual consent

**The ugliest possible peace:** No victory parades, no moral triumph. Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt and agreeing to pretend the other one exists while the continent quietly bleeds out.

---

**Q4:** How does Lincoln react to the negotiated peace? Does he:
- [ ] Accept it reluctantly?
- [ ] Get replaced before it's signed?
- [ ] Refuse and get overruled?
- [ ] Something else?

**A4:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/lincoln-fate-1864-1865.md`**

**Lincoln is replaced before the treaty is signed.**

**Exact sequence:**
- **November 1864:** Lincoln loses the election to McClellan on a straight "peace now" platform
- **4 March 1865:** McClellan is inaugurated. Lincoln becomes a lame-duck president for exactly 27 days
- **31 March 1865:** Treaty of Cincinnati signed. Lincoln is no longer in office

**Lincoln's last public act (2 March 1865):** A short, bitter farewell address from the White House steps: "The people have chosen peace. I pray it is the peace that heals, and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning. God save these United States." He then boards the train to Springfield and never speaks publicly about the war again.

**The result:** Lincoln never has to sign the treaty. He loses the election fair and square, serves out his term with dignity, and lets McClellan own the surrender. That's the cleanest, most historically honest, and most emotionally devastating outcome possible.

## THE FIRE (1865-1894)

### The Last Hurrah Raids

**Q5:** Who leads the "Last Hurrah" raids (1865–1867)? Are they:
- [ ] Organized Northern cells/underground networks?
- [ ] Spontaneous groups of Union veterans?
- [ ] Government-sanctioned operations?
- [ ] Something else?

**A5:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/last-hurrah-raids.md`**

**Hybrid, but overwhelmingly organized Northern cells with a twist:**

**Leadership structure:**
- **Strategic leadership:** "The Committee of Nine" – nine hard-line abolitionists (three ex-Underground Railroad, three ex-Kansas jayhawkers, three radical clergy) meeting in secret in Boston and Cincinnati
- **Field commanders:** Ex-Union cavalry officers (many former prisoners of war) who "resigned" the day the treaty was signed
- **Troops:** Mix of freedmen who walked out of the CSA, Union veterans who refused to muster out, and idealistic college boys from New England

**Key factions:**
- **Organized Northern cells:** The core – abolitionist societies (Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati) funded by Quaker money, Garrison radicals, and secret "John Brown Memorial Funds" (10/10 realism)
- **Spontaneous Union veterans:** Join in large numbers but never lead. They provide muscle and local knowledge, not strategy (9/10 realism)
- **Government-sanctioned:** Never. U.S. officially denounces raiders as criminals (0/10 realism)
- **Secret twist:** Raids are quietly protected by lame-duck Lincoln (March 1865) and early McClellan (April–July 1865) who refuse to use federal troops to stop them while treaty ink is still wet (10/10 realism)

**Key raids:**
- **May 1865:** "The Burning of the Black Belt" (Col. James Montgomery redux) – 27 plantations in Alabama torched
- **Oct 1865:** "The Great Carolina Ride" (ex-Captain Thomas Higginson) – 3,000 slaves liberated, 41 plantations burned
- **Spring 1866:** "The Arkansas Night" – 19 cotton gins destroyed, 1,200 slaves reach Sequoyah
- **Winter 1866–67:** Final wave – smaller, more desperate

**End:** July 1867 – joint U.S.–CSA "Border Pacification Act." 1868–69 – leaders hanged in public trials. After 1869 only local copy-cat raids remain.

**The nature:** Organised Northern abolitionist terrorism with veteran muscle, quietly tolerated for one final burning season, then crushed. No government sanction. Just the dying scream of the people who lost the war but refused to lose the fight.

---

**Q6:** What specific actions do these raids take? Are they:
- [ ] Attacking Confederate infrastructure?
- [ ] Freeing enslaved people?
- [ ] Assassination attempts?
- [ ] Something else?

**A6:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/last-hurrah-rules-of-engagement.md`**

**Strict, locked rules of engagement:**

**Target priority:**
- **Primary – cash crops & infrastructure:** Burn cotton/tobacco/sugar in field or warehouse. Destroy gins, presses, rail depots. (Economic destruction = the whole point)
- **Secondary – workhouses & slave quarters used as punishment:** Torch only when used for convict leasing or brutal discipline. (Symbolic "we free the living, burn the chains")
- **Off-limits – main houses & family slave quarters:** Never intentionally burned or looted. (Keeps Northern public sympathy and legal deniability)

**Freedpeople:** Every raid carries off as many enslaved people as possible, on horseback or wagons. Primary moral mission.

**The calling card** (left nailed to the porch of every spared mansion): "Your roof stands because your sin is in the fields. Next year the fields will be empty. Choose."

**Strict prohibitions:**
- No assassinations
- No house burnings
- No rape, no murder of non-combatants

Just fire in the cotton, freedom on the hoof.

**The rule:** Raids burn the crop, never the cradle. Living quarters off-limits. This survives the joint crackdown and lets the legend live on as "righteous" instead of "savage."

---

**Q7:** How does the "joint crackdown" (1867-69) work? Do U.S. and CSA forces actually cooperate?

**A7:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/joint-crackdown-1867-1869.md`**

**Yes, they cooperate, but it is the most reluctant, teeth-grinding, temporary marriage in North-American history.**

**How it works:**
- **Legal basis:** Border Pacification Act (July 1867) – identical law passed by both Congresses within 48 hours of each other
- **Command structure:** Joint Border Commission – 3 U.S. officers, 3 CSA officers, 1 rotating neutral chair (usually a Sequoyah marshal)
- **Operational reality:** Mixed patrols: one company U.S. cavalry rides beside one company CSA cavalry under a white "truce" flag
- **Rules of engagement:** Raiders are shot or hanged on the spot – no trials, no prisoners. Both sides agree: "dead raiders tell no tales"
- **Most infamous joint action:** Battle of the Red River Ford, 12 April 1868 – 400 raiders cornered by 600 joint troopers. 341 raiders killed, 59 captured and hanged the next morning

**Tone of the cooperation:**
- Officers refuse to salute each other
- Campfires are separate
- When a U.S. captain and CSA captain have to share a tent during a storm, they sleep with revolvers on their laps
- The only thing they agree on is that the raiders have to die

**Result by spring 1869:**
- Organised Northern cells are exterminated
- Leaders publicly hanged in joint ceremonies (one in Richmond, one in Washington)
- The continent breathes a sigh of relief and pretends the whole thing never happened

**The legacy:** Real military cooperation carried out with ice-cold mutual hatred. It is the first and last time U.S. and CSA soldiers ever fight together until the Zimmerman Telegram forces them to do it again in 1917.

### The Toombs Act

**Q8:** What is the exact name and details of the "Toombs Act" or "African Labour Restoration Act" (1867-68)? Need:
- Full legal name
- Specific provisions
- How it reopens the African trade
- Who supports/opposes it

**A8:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/toombs-act-1867.md`**

**Full legal name:** "An Act to Restore to the Citizens of the Confederate States the Full Enjoyment of Their Natural Right to the African Labour Trade, and for Other Purposes" (popularly called the African Labour Restoration Act of 1867 or simply Toombs Act)

**Dates:**
- Passage: 19 December 1867
- Signed by President Robert Toombs: 1 January 1868
- Effective: 1 March 1868

**Specific provisions (verbatim):**
- **Section 1:** Repeals prohibition on importation from Africa (re-opens Atlantic slave trade with zero restrictions)
- **Section 2:** Any citizen may import persons from Africa as merchandise (slaves are legally commodities again)
- **Section 3:** Duties not to exceed $25 per head (makes it dirt-cheap)
- **Section 4:** No state may prohibit or restrict importation (states' rights die when they threaten the trade)
- **Section 5:** President authorized to negotiate treaties with African kingdoms (diplomatic cover: "we're buying, not kidnapping")

**Vote breakdown:**
- Fire-eaters + Deep-South planters (58%): YES - "This is why we fought"
- Border-state moderates (22%): NO - Terrified of British reaction
- Merchants & railroad men (15%): YES - Cheap labour = cheaper cotton
- Longstreet wing + army officers (5%): NO - "This will get us boycotted into the stone age"
- **Final vote:** 62% – 38% (passes after Toombs threatens to veto every appropriations bill)

**International reaction (1868):**
- Britain: Recalls ambassador, imposes total cotton boycott within 60 days
- France: Follows Britain
- U.S.: Raises tariffs to 300%
- **Within 18 months:** CSA economy bleeding gold faster than new slaves can pick cotton

**The result:** The single most self-inflicted wound that turns victory into a 25-year economic suicide pact and makes 1905 abolition inevitable. Stupid, greedy, and perfectly in character for a triumphant, drunk-on-victory Confederacy.

---

**Q9:** How many enslaved people are imported during the "Second Middle Passage" (1867-1894)? Rough estimate?

**A9:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/second-middle-passage-numbers.md`**

**Locked total: ≈ 565,000 new Africans forcibly imported into the CSA during the Second Middle Passage.**

**Breakdown by period:**
- **1867–1874 ("Toombs Boom"):** 35,000–45,000 per year = 320,000 total (peak years, full boycott hasn't bitten yet, planters panic-buying to rebuild war losses)
- **1875–1884 (boycott tightening):** 15,000–20,000 per year = 170,000 total (prices crash, insurance impossible, but smuggling routes still work)
- **1885–1894 (death spiral):** 4,000–8,000 per year = 60,000 total (only most desperate planters; most ships seized or sunk by British patrols)
- **Total 1867–1894:** 550,000 – 580,000 (conservative, locked estimate)

**Historical context:**
- Roughly equal to the entire illegal U.S. slave trade 1808–1860
- About 60% of the legal trans-Atlantic trade to British North America 1619–1808
- Enough to keep the institution breathing for one more generation
- But not enough to save it from the raids + boycott + runaway haemorrhage

**The result:** 565,000 souls is the exact price the Confederacy pays for Robert Toombs's victory speech. It is the number that finally makes the world say "enough" and turns 1894–1905 into the coffin-nail years.

**Q10:** What triggers the global boycott? Is it:
- [ ] Coordinated by European powers?
- [ ] Organic response from abolitionist movements?
- [ ] Economic pressure from cotton glut?
- [ ] Combination?

**A10:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/global-boycott-trigger.md`**

**Combination, but with a clear sequence and a single decisive moment:**

**The sequence:**
1. **The Toombs Act itself (Dec 1867):** The legal spark – the moment the CSA publicly re-opens the African trade (Britain has been waiting for this exact excuse since 1861)
2. **First slave ships dock publicly (Mar–Jul 1868):** The moral detonator – photos of chained Africans on Charleston wharves printed in London papers (identical to OTL Brazil 1880s outrage)
3. **British abolitionist societies:** Immediate coordinated campaign – petitions, sermons, dock-worker strikes in Liverpool/Manchester (same networks that killed the trade OTL)
4. **British government action (Aug 1868):** Royal Navy declared "anti-slavery patrol" – any ship touching a CSA port is stopped and searched (they did this to Brazil 1850)
5. **France + smaller powers follow:** Within 60 days – full diplomatic rupture and trade boycott
6. **Cotton glut (1880s):** Secondary amplifier – makes the boycott hurt more, but is not the trigger

**Exact trigger moment:**
- **4 July 1868:** The slave ship Wildfire II docks in Charleston with 720 Africans
- **28 July 1868:** Photographs are in London papers
- **12 August 1868:** British cabinet votes boycott
- **1 September 1868:** First Royal Navy frigate appears off Charleston
- Everything after that is follow-on pain

**The nature:** The global boycott is not organic outrage alone. It is Britain weaponising abolition the moment the CSA hands them the perfect casus belli. The Toombs Act lights the fuse. The photographs are the explosion. The Royal Navy is the hammer. That's the sequence. No single factor. All of them, in order.

### Native Super-States

**Q11:** How exactly do the Native super-states consolidate? Is it:
- [ ] Gradual process over decades?
- [ ] Formalized in the Treaty of Cincinnati?
- [ ] Separate treaties later?
- [ ] Combination?

**A11:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/native-superstates-consolidation.md`**

**Combination, but 95% locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (1865) and only polished later.**

**How each super-state becomes sovereign:**
- **Sequoyah:** Article 4 of Treaty of Cincinnati (31 Mar 1865) explicitly recognises united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored (Instant – 1865)
- **Dakota (Lakota Confederacy):** Same treaty – U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory (Instant – 1865)
- **Comanchería:** Treaty Article 5 – "the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognised as single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders (Instant – 1865)
- **Navajo (Diné):** Treaty Article 6 – 1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range (Instant – 1865)
- **Cherokee Outlet:** Separate 1866 side-agreement between Sequoyah and U.S./CSA – Outlet stripped from Kansas and given to Cherokee Nation as sovereign territory (1866)

**Later consolidation (only window dressing):**
- **1871:** Council of the Four Roads first meets (rotating host cities)
- **1889:** Permanent council charter signed – still no central government, just arbitration and mutual defence
- **1919:** Formal "Confederated Indigenous Nations" customs union (trade only)

**The result:** 95% of the consolidation is done in one pen stroke on 31 March 1865 because both exhausted American republics need the Native nations as a permanent buffer and are willing to pay with sovereignty to get it. The rest is just paperwork and tradition. No gradual process. No decades of negotiation. One treaty. One signature. Five new nations. That's how super-states are born when the white empires are too tired to fight anymore.

**Q12:** What is the exact process for Sequoyah becoming a refuge for escaped slaves? How does it work legally and practically?

**A12:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/sequoyah-slave-refuge.md`**

**Two iron-clad mechanisms, both locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865):**

**1. Sovereign asylum:** "No citizen of the Confederate States or United States shall have the right to pursue, reclaim, or remove any person held to service or labour who has taken refuge within the sovereign territory of the Sequoyah Republic." (Any escaped slave who reaches Sequoyah soil is untouchable. No extradition, no hot pursuit.)

**2. Instant citizenship path:** "Any person held to service or labour who resides within Sequoyah for one year and one day shall be deemed a citizen of the Sequoyah Republic with all rights and protections thereof." (After 366 days, the former slave can enrol as a full citizen of one of the Nations and is legally free forever.)

**How it works on the ground (1865–1894):**
- **Slave crosses the border:** Usually on foot, at night, guided by local freedmen networks or Comanche scouts who hate the CSA
- **Immediate protection:** Sequoyah Lighthorse (tribal police) meet them at the line. Slave-catchers who follow are shot on sight
- **366-day countdown:** Refugee is given a cabin, land to farm, and protection. After one year + one day → citizenship ceremony
- **Legal status after citizenship:** Now a Sequoyah citizen – any attempt to re-enslave is an act of war against a sovereign nation

**Numbers (locked estimate):**
- 1865–1875: ~80,000 reach Sequoyah
- 1875–1894: ~120,000 more
- By 1894: ~200,000 former slaves and their children are full Sequoyah citizens

**The result:** Sequoyah is the Haiti of North America – a sovereign state that says to every runaway: "Cross this line and you are free. Stay one year and you are family. Touch one of ours and we burn your world down." Legal. Practical. Unbreakable.

**Q13:** What happens to the Mormon Deseret? Is it:
- [ ] Sovereign like the Native super-states?
- [ ] Absorbed by the U.S.?
- [ ] Split between U.S. and CSA?
- [ ] Something else?

**A13:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/mormon-deseret.md`**

**Sovereign, exactly like the Native super-states, and for the exact same reason.**

**Status and mechanism (1865):**
- **Sovereign theocracy:** Treaty of Cincinnati, Article 7 – "The State of Deseret, comprising the Great Basin territory settled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is recognised as a sovereign entity under joint U.S.–Confederate protection"
- **Borders:** Roughly modern Utah + southern Nevada + small slices of Arizona/Colorado/Idaho (the 1850s State of Deseret proposal, minus California's claims)
- **Why it survives:** Both U.S. and CSA are terrified of another Mormon War. Brigham Young still commands 15,000 armed men in 1865. Neither side has the troops or will to fight Salt Lake after four years of bleeding

**Realistic 1865–2025 trajectory:**
- **1865–1877:** Brigham Young rules as de-facto prophet-king. No U.S. governor, no federal troops
- **1877–1890:** Succession crisis after Brigham's death → slower polygamy phase-out to keep trade flowing
- **1890–1920:** Quietly becomes the Switzerland of the West – banks, mining, neutral broker between California and the fractured U.S.
- **1920–2025:** Rich, weird, heavily armed theocracy that everyone trades with but nobody quite trusts

**The result:** Deseret is not absorbed, split, or crushed. It is the one white settler polity that wins the exact same deal as the Native super-states: "Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone." And both exhausted American republics sign it because neither can afford another Utah War. Deseret in 2025: Salt Lake City skyline, temple spires, and a national guard that still drills with 19th-century zeal.

### Economic Details

**Q14:** How does the "global cotton glut" happen? Is it:
- [ ] India/Egypt ramping up production?
- [ ] Synthetic alternatives?
- [ ] Reduced demand?
- [ ] Combination?

**A14:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/global-cotton-glut.md`**

**Combination, but 90% India/Egypt ramping up production (the only realistic 1880s–1890s trigger).**

**Factor breakdown:**
- **India & Egypt production surge:** 85–90% (OTL Egypt + India flooded the market 1865–1890 because of the American Civil War vacuum. In NTL the CSA never regains its pre-war share)
- **Reduced European demand:** 5–8% (possible from 1890s depression, but not the main driver)
- **Synthetic alternatives:** 0% (rayon is 1910+, nylon 1935+)
- **Other:** 2–5% (weather, transport improvements)

**Realistic locked timeline:**
- **1865–1875:** India/Egypt already at war-time peak. CSA tries to rebuild but raids + boycott keep output low
- **1875–1885:** British investment in Egyptian irrigation + Indian rail network → massive surplus
- **1886–1890:** Global cotton prices crash 40–50% (OTL numbers – even worse in NTL because CSA can't compete)
- **1890–1894:** CSA planters drowning in unsold bales → final desperation → last hold-out states capitulate

**The result:** The global cotton glut is 90% India + Egypt doing what they did OTL and 10% everything else. No synthetics needed. No magic reduced demand. Just the same flood that almost killed slavery in Brazil OTL hitting the CSA ten years earlier because the raids and boycott kept them from ever regaining market share.

**Q15:** What is the economic relationship between U.S., CSA, and Native super-states? Are there:
- [ ] Trade agreements?
- [ ] Tariffs?
- [ ] Shared currency?
- [ ] Trade wars?

**A15:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/economic-relationships-1865-2025.md`**

**Economic features (1865–2025):**
- **No shared currency:** U.S. dollar, Confederate dollar, and separate tribal currencies (Sequoyah silver dollar, Dakota trade beads, Comanchería cattle notes, etc.). All convertible at fixed rates in border banks
- **Trade agreements:** Triad Free-Trade Zone (U.S., CSA, California) from 1905 onward. Native super-states have permanent most-favoured-nation status but negotiate as sovereign blocs
- **Tariffs:** 1865–1905: punitive Northern tariffs on CSA slave-grown goods. 1905–2025: zero internal tariffs between U.S., CSA, California. Native super-states charge export duties on raw materials (oil, beef, timber) but zero import duties
- **Trade wars:** 1865–1905: cold trade war (boycott era). 1905–2025: occasional flare-ups (e.g., 1930s U.S. tries to tax California oil, gets slapped down)
- **Special Native economic weapon:** Every super-state can shut its borders to either U.S. or CSA traffic at will. The trans-continental railroads all cross Native land → instant stranglehold if anyone misbehaves (this is why no one invades them)

**Realistic 2025 economic map:**
- **Republic of California:** California dollar (pegged to gold), GDP rank 1, Pacific tech/oil/entertainment empire
- **United States (East):** U.S. dollar (fiat), GDP rank 2, Industrial heartland, rusting in places
- **Confederate States:** Confederate dollar (silver-backed), GDP rank 3, Oil, cotton, manufacturing, still proud
- **Native super-states (collective):** Mixed tribal currencies, GDP rank 4 (combined), Resource billionaires who own the continent's arteries

**The result:** Money flows freely. Borders are hard. Everyone is rich. Nobody is in charge. That's the economic reality of the continent from 1905 onward. California prints the cheques. The Native nations own the roads. U.S. and CSA spend the money and pretend they're still superpowers.

**Q31:** What happens to border states like Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and West Virginia? Which side do they end up on?

**A31:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/treaty-of-cincinnati.md` and `world-building/west-virginia-treaty-correction.md`**

- **Kentucky and Missouri:** Remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River
- **Maryland:** Remains U.S.
- **West Virginia:** Stays a U.S. state – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States"

**Why West Virginia stays U.S.:** The CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right they claimed for themselves. West Virginia sent 32,000 men to the Union army; handing them back would be political suicide. Virginia grumbles, but the CSA has bigger problems and no leverage. Forcing reunification would guarantee permanent guerrilla war on the Virginia border.
