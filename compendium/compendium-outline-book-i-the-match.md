## STRUCTURAL NOTES

**Organizational Principle:** Follows novel reading order chronologically. Analyzes topics as reader encounters them in novels, not by academic discipline.

**Natural Thinning:** 
- Book I: Dense (6,000-10,000 words/section) - establishing all foundations
- Book II: Medium (4,000-7,000 words/section) - new topics, references foundations
- Book III: Light (3,000-5,000 words/section) - mostly references, new diplomatic content
- Book IV: Lightest (2,000-4,000 words/section) - three books of foundation to reference

**MJFL Voice Escalation:**
- Book I: Professional academic, mild snark (2-3/10)
- Book II: Sharper edge, less patient (5-6/10)
- Book III: Pointed, openly critical (7-8/10)
- Book IV: Full satire in main text (8/10), appendices unleashed (10/10)

## NEXT STEPS

This is the Book I detailed outline. Book II-IV outlines need:

1. **Presidential pairs structure** (you mentioned "The Peacemakers" etc. - need chapter-by-chapter breakdown)
2. **Raid details** (Pettigrew Raid, Court-Martial in the Pines, specific operations)
3. **WWI timeline details** (what specific events 1914-1919?)
4. **Depression dynamics** (how does tri-nation system respond differently?)

**Status:** Book I outline complete - ready for development  
**Note:** This outline follows the novel reading order chronologically, not academic discipline. Voice escalates from professional (Book I) to full satire (Book IV appendices).
