## The Embers (1894 – 1919) – Medium Detail

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|

## The Ashes (1920 – 1939) – Broad Strokes, Ends Exactly Where You Want

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1920–1921 | **The Handoff** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president takes office as a war-weary Northern president finishes his term, both exhausted by a war they didn't want. |
| 1921–1926 | **The Concord Cooperation** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president and a "return to normalcy" Northern president achieve peak cooperation while both know it's fragile. |

| 1920s | Great Depression hits the divided continent |
| 1932–1933 | **The Handoff** – A conservative Confederate Gentry president takes office as a Depression-blamed Northern president loses his election, both knowing the crisis is just beginning. |
| 1933–1938 | **The Economic Concord** – An austerity-focused Confederate conservative and a New Deal Northern reformer achieve cooperation while both want different things from the same crisis. |
| 1930s | Pacific tension rises (Japan, enabled by California oil) |
| 1 Sep 1939 | Germany invades Poland (or NTL equivalent trigger) → newspapers scream again |
| Sep 1939 | Final scene: a Fairfax and a Haskell on opposite sides of the continent read the same headline |

**Note:** California has been independent since 1873. By 1920, it has been its own country for 47 years—the rich, smug, Pacific-facing youngest sibling who moved out early, didn't get involved in the family politics, and made it rich. By the time WW1 starts (1914), it has been independent for 41 years.

## Why 1939 Is the Perfect Cut-Off

### Moral & Thematic Symmetry
You began with the fire (1863). You end with the continent watching **the world** catch fire (1939). The reader closes the book knowing the ashes of 1861 were only the prologue.

### Narrative Closure Without Resolution
Slavery is legally dead (1905), raids are local embers, the super-states are sovereign, California has been independent since 1873, the triad is real but fragile. Nothing is "fixed." Everything is **poised**. The reader feels the next war coming the way you feel thunder in your bones.

### Historical Honesty
1939 is the last year the NTL can still feel like "our" history with different paint. After 1939 every butterfly is a hurricane. Stopping here keeps the alt-history **believable** instead of turning into 21st-century fan-fiction.

## The Final Image of The Ashes (1939)

A Fairfax (now in his 70s, living on the Sequoyah lease-land that is no longer his) and a Haskell (U.S. Navy captain, East Coast) stand on opposite sides of the continent reading the same newspaper headline:

**"GERMANY INVADES POLAND"**

They each think the same thought, in different accents:

**"We thought our war was the big one."**

Fade to black.

1863–1939.  
Four books.  
One continent.  
From the match that lit America to the ashes that are about to consume the world.

No epilogue needed.

The reader knows what comes next and knows the continent will never be ready.

That's not an ending.

That's a **warning**.
