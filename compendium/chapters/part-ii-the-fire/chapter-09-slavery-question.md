## FAIRFAX-LOCKWOOD COMMENTARY

Academic honesty compels acknowledgment: the Fairfaxs were slave owners. I neither apologize for nor condemn my forefathers. They were men of their time, and their accounting with the Almighty remains their business, not mine.

I note only that Granny Sam—my great-grandmother Samantha—possessed a singular gift for abolitionism that required neither pamphlet nor pulpit. A single level stare from that formidable woman could make a man question why he would condemn a fellow human to inhumanity, and dare him to be better. She accomplished more with silence than the Boston committees managed with volumes.

My disdain for the Northern abolitionist derives not from disagreement on slavery's evil—there they would find me, to their shock, an ally—but from their underbred, sanctimonious braying while simultaneously herding native peoples with a brutality that would embarrass Genghis Khan.

Trail of Tears, indeed. Hypocrisy I can forgive. Hypocrisy delivered with self-congratulation I cannot.
    M.J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Sequoyah, 1985

[NOTE: It might have, perhaps been an oversight to grant the Dr. Gen. uncensored input into the chapter lead ins in exchange for more, restraint, in the footnotes ~ G.R.O.Kronvoldt]
