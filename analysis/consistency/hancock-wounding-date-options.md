# Hancock Wounding Date: Options Analysis

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Context:** If we assert Version B (Pickett's Raid: June 14 - July 14, 1864), can we move Hancock's wounding date?

**Current:** July 12, 1864 (2 days before raid ends)

---

## CURRENT STATE

**Pickett's Raid:** June 14 - July 14, 1864 (30 days)  
**Hancock Wounded:** July 12, 1864  
**Gap:** 2 days before raid ends

**Narrative:** "Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead) while pursuing Pickett"

---

## OPTIONS FOR HANCOCK'S WOUNDING DATE

### Option 1: Keep July 12, 1864 (Current) ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Timeline:**
- Raid: June 14 - July 14
- Hancock wounded: July 12 (2 days before raid ends)
- Hood replacement: July 17 (3 days after raid ends)

**Narrative Flow:**
- ✅ Hancock wounded **during active raiding phase** - perfect dramatic timing
- ✅ **2-Day Withdrawal Period:** July 12-14 represents Pickett's withdrawal from Northern soil
- ✅ "While pursuing Pickett" makes perfect sense - raid is still active
- ✅ **Clean Withdrawal Narrative:** Pickett uses 2 days to safely cross border after Hancock is wounded
- ✅ Clean sequence: Hancock wounded → 2-day withdrawal → Raid ends → 3 days → Hood replacement

**Plausibility:** **95%**
- Perfect narrative coherence
- No timeline conflicts
- Strong dramatic timing
- **Military realism:** Withdrawal period after major raid is standard practice

**Downstream Impact:**
- ✅ No changes needed
- ✅ All events align perfectly

---

### Option 2: Move to July 14, 1864 (Same Day Raid Ends)

**Timeline:**
- Raid: June 14 - July 14
- Hancock wounded: July 14 (same day raid ends)
- Hood replacement: July 17 (3 days after)

**Narrative Flow:**
- ✅ Hancock wounded on **final day of raid** - climactic timing
- ✅ "While pursuing Pickett" works - last day of pursuit
- ✅ Raid ends same day - clean closure
- ✅ Clean sequence: Raid ends + Hancock wounded → 3 days → Hood replacement

**Plausibility:** **93%**
- Very clean narrative
- Slightly less dramatic than mid-raid wound
- Still makes perfect sense

**Downstream Impact:**
- ⚠️ Need to update: 1 date change
- ✅ All other events align perfectly

**Files to Update:**
- `world-building-master/06-timelines.md` - Change July 12 → July 14
- `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` - Change July 12 → July 14

---

### Option 3: Move to July 15, 1864 (Day After Raid Ends)

**Timeline:**
- Raid: June 14 - July 14
- Hancock wounded: July 15 (1 day after raid ends)
- Hood replacement: July 17 (2 days after raid ends)

**Narrative Flow:**
- ⚠️ Hancock wounded **after raid ends** - requires explanation
- ⚠️ "While pursuing Pickett" needs clarification - pursuing withdrawal?
- ✅ Still close enough to raid to maintain connection
- ✅ Clean sequence: Raid ends → Hancock wounded → 2 days → Hood replacement

**Plausibility:** **85%**
- Requires narrative explanation for post-raid pursuit
- Less dramatic than mid-raid wound
- Still plausible but weaker

**Narrative Options:**
- **Option A:** Hancock pursuing Pickett's withdrawal route
- **Option B:** Hancock intercepting Pickett's return crossing
- **Option C:** Final skirmish as Pickett crosses back into CSA

**Downstream Impact:**
- ⚠️ Need to update: 1 date change + narrative clarification
- ✅ All other events align perfectly

**Files to Update:**
- `world-building-master/06-timelines.md` - Change July 12 → July 15
- `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` - Change July 12 → July 15
- Narrative text: Clarify "pursuing withdrawal" or "final skirmish"

---

### Option 4: Move Earlier - July 10, 1864 (4 Days Before Raid Ends)

**Timeline:**
- Raid: June 14 - July 14
- Hancock wounded: July 10 (4 days before raid ends)
- Hood replacement: July 17 (7 days after raid ends)

**Narrative Flow:**
- ✅ Hancock wounded **during active raid** - good dramatic timing
- ✅ "While pursuing Pickett" makes perfect sense
- ✅ Raid continues for 4 more days - shows raid's independence
- ✅ Clean sequence: Raid ends → 3 days → Hood replacement

**Plausibility:** **92%**
- Good narrative coherence
- Slightly less climactic than July 12
- Still strong

**Downstream Impact:**
- ⚠️ Need to update: 1 date change
- ✅ All other events align perfectly

**Files to Update:**
- `world-building-master/06-timelines.md` - Change July 12 → July 10
- `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` - Change July 12 → July 10

## COMPARISON TABLE

| Option | Date | Gap to Raid End | Narrative Quality | Plausibility | Changes Needed |
|--------|------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Option 1** | July 12 | 2 days before | ✅ Excellent | **95%** | None |
| **Option 2** | July 14 | Same day | ✅ Very Good | **93%** | 2 files |
| **Option 3** | July 15 | 1 day after | ⚠️ Good (needs explanation) | **85%** | 2 files + narrative |

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Must Maintain:
1. **"Commands from bed through March 1865"** - Any date works, but earlier = longer bed command period
2. **"While pursuing Pickett"** - Works best if raid is active or just ended
3. **Hood Replacement (July 17)** - Must happen after raid ends (momentum)
4. **Narrative Impact** - Needs to feel climactic and connected to raid

### Timeline Anchors:
- **Raid Start:** June 14, 1864 (locked)
- **Raid End:** July 14, 1864 (Version B - asserted)
- **Hood Replacement:** July 17, 1864 (locked - must be after raid)
- **Winter of Despair:** Aug-Dec 1864 (needs time to build after raid)

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### **Keep July 12, 1864 (Option 1) - NO CHANGE NEEDED**

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ **Highest Plausibility:** 95% - perfect narrative coherence
2. ✅ **Best Dramatic Timing:** Wounded during active raid, not at end
3. ✅ **No Changes Required:** Already matches current master timeline
4. ✅ **Clean Narrative:** "While pursuing Pickett" makes perfect sense
5. ✅ **Raid Independence:** Raid continues 2 more days after wound - shows Pickett's success isn't dependent on Hancock's pursuit

**Why NOT move it:**
- **July 14:** Less dramatic - wounding on last day feels less climactic, loses withdrawal narrative
- **July 15+:** Requires narrative explanation for post-raid pursuit, loses withdrawal narrative
- **July 10:** Less climactic - too early in raid's final phase, loses withdrawal narrative

**Key Narrative Benefit:**
- ✅ **2-Day Withdrawal Period:** The gap between July 12 (wound) and July 14 (raid end) represents Pickett's withdrawal from Northern soil - this is **militarily realistic and narratively clean**

---

## ALTERNATIVE: IF MOVING FOR CLEANER TIMELINE

If you want **maximum narrative cleanliness**, **Option 2 (July 14)** is acceptable:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Same day raid ends - clean closure
- ✅ Still "while pursuing Pickett" - works perfectly
- ✅ No narrative explanation needed

**Cost:**
- ⚠️ Slightly less dramatic (wounding on last day vs. mid-raid)
- ⚠️ Need to update 2 files

**Verdict:** Option 1 (July 12) is better, but Option 2 (July 14) is acceptable if you prefer cleaner dates.

---

## CONCLUSION

**Answer:** Yes, we CAN move Hancock's wounding date, but **we SHOULDN'T**.

**Current date (July 12) is optimal:**
- Highest plausibility (95%)
- Best dramatic timing
- Perfect narrative coherence
- No changes needed

**If you want to move it anyway:**
- **July 14** is acceptable (93% plausibility, cleaner date)
- **July 15+** requires narrative explanation (85% plausibility)
- **July 10** is fine but less climactic (92% plausibility)

**Recommendation:** **Keep July 12, 1864** - it's already perfect.

---

**Status:** Current date is optimal - no change recommended
