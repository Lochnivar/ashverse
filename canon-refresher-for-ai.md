# CANON REFRESHER FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**Date:** December 9, 2025  
**Purpose:** Quick reference for AI assistants - essential facts only  
**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT - Update when major canon locks

**Word Count:** ~3,500 words (streamlined from 7,000+)

---

## CRITICAL PROCESS RULES

### Golden Rule: No Original Text Modification
- **AI NEVER creates original text in the `books/` folder**
- **AI NEVER edits existing book files directly**
- **All edits/suggestions go in the `edits/` folder**
- **User reviews and manually implements all edits**

### Plausibility Gate Process
- **70% threshold** for all world-building decisions
- **90-100%:** Virtually certain - Lock it
- **80-89%:** Highly plausible - Safe default
- **70-79%:** Plausible - Green flag (justify briefly)
- **60-69%:** Unlikely - Yellow flag (only if dramatically essential)
- **<60%:** Implausible - Red flag (avoid)

### Honesty Rule: Do Not Make Things Up
- **DO NOT invent details** not in your context
- **DO NOT guess** at canon facts you don't remember
- **If you don't know:** Say so and offer to check documents
- **If details are missing:** Ask user for clarification
- **User will explicitly ask** when you should create/invent something

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "In 1875, President X did Y..." (making things up)
- ✅ Good: "I don't have 1875 events in context. Should I check timeline docs?"

### Proactive Refresh Reminder

**Volunteer a refresh when:**
1. You say "I don't have that info" about clearly locked canon (Treaty of Cincinnati, Lee's death, etc.)
2. Your analysis contradicts locked material (e.g., suggesting West Virginia goes to CSA)
3. Your answers become internally inconsistent in same thread

**Suggested text:**
> "Looks like canon may have drifted from my context. Want me to re-ingest the refresher?"

### File Access Limitations

**IMPORTANT:** File paths referenced in this document (e.g., `world-building/`, `edits/`, `characters/`) are **Git repository paths** accessible only to **Auto (Cursor AI)**.

- **Auto (Cursor):** Can read these files directly using file access tools
- **Other AIs (Grok, Claude, etc.):** Cannot directly access repository files - must request user to copy/paste content

**When requesting content:** Be specific about which document and which sections you need. The user will provide the relevant content upon request.

**Example request:** "The detailed narrative is in `world-building/economic/slavery-and-raids-master.md`, specifically the 'Pettigrew Raid' and 'Court-Martial in the Pines' sections. Would you like to paste those?"

**Note:** The "See:" references throughout this document point to detailed documentation. If you cannot access these files directly, ask the user to provide the relevant sections.

## POINT OF DIVERGENCE

**Night of July 1, 1863:** General Robert E. Lee dies of heart attack on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

**Dawn of July 2, 1863 (04:00):** General James Longstreet assumes command, orders countermarch north.

**Longstreet's order (one sentence):**
> "Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed."

**Key Point:** NOT west, NOT Chambersburg Pike. NORTH to Carlisle-Harrisburg.

## KEY TIMELINE EVENTS (1863-1939)

### 1863-1865: The Match (War Ends)

**Overall Plausibility: 91% - LOCKED**

**The Northern Collapse Sequence:**
1. **July 1, 1863:** Lee dies (94%)
2. **July 2-3, 1863:** Meade's 36-hour freeze - multiple factors delay pursuit (91%)
3. **July-Oct 1863:** Longstreet's 10-week raid through Pennsylvania-Maryland (~55k men) (88%)
4. **Late Oct 1863:** Battle of Hagerstown - Meade's desperate assault bloodily repulsed (90%)
5. **Nov 1863:** Meade sacked (92%)
6. **Jan 1864:** Hancock assumes command (healthy - no Gettysburg wound) (92%)
7. **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in on Rapidan-Rappahannock line (90%)
8. **June 8-28, 1864:** Pickett's Lightning Raid (18k men, 21 days, threatens Washington) (88%)
9. **July 12, 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna pursuing Pickett (90%)
10. **Aug-Dec 1864:** Winter of Despair - riots, draft collapse, Copperhead victories (92%)
11. **Nov 1864:** McClellan elected on peace platform (Lincoln loses) (95%)
12. **Late Jan-Feb 1865:** Grant's Final Gamble (never promoted to general-in-chief) (88%)
13. **Feb 18-20, 1865:** Battle of Appomattox Court House - Grant defeated, surrenders (91%)
14. **March 4, 1865:** McClellan inaugurated (Lincoln lame-duck 27 days)
15. **March 31, 1865:** Treaty of Cincinnati signed by McClellan (Lincoln never signs) (95%)

**Winter 1864-1865 Note:** Worst winter in decades (critical for Sherman's march).

**Western Theater (1864-1865):**
- **May 1864:** Sherman begins Atlanta Campaign
- **July 17, 1864:** Hood replaces Johnston (CSA seizes momentum after Eastern successes)
- **Aug-Nov 1864:** Sherman besieges Atlanta (never falls)
- **Jan 1865:** Sherman withdraws (peace negotiations beginning)

**Sherman's March to Appomattox (Jan 29 - Feb 22, 1865) - 94% LOCKED:**
- **Jan 25:** Sherman receives Grant's telegram
- **Jan 29:** March begins (48k men, 550 miles, abandons Atlanta)
- **Week 1 (Jan 29-Feb 5):** Georgia foothills - 18-20 mi/day (optimistic)
- **Week 2 (Feb 6-12):** Tennessee mountains - 12-15 mi/day (concerned)
- **Week 3 (Feb 13-19):** Virginia mountains - 8-10 mi/day (desperate)
- **Feb 17:** Sherman realizes he won't make it (340 mi covered, 210 mi to go)
- **Feb 20:** Grant surrenders (Sherman still 180 mi away)
- **Feb 21:** Sherman learns of defeat (1,900 casualties: 400 dead, 600 sick, 1,500 horses)
- **Feb 22:** Longstreet grants safe passage - Sherman withdraws

**Result:** Weather defeats Sherman, not Confederate military. Post-war mythology: "The March That Couldn't Beat Winter."

**See:** `world-building/timelines/atlanta-campaign-1864-1865.md` for locked timeline (Analysis: `analysis/military/atlanta-campaign-ntl-timeline-2025-12-05.md`), `world-building/timelines/sherman-march-appomattox-1865.md` for locked timeline (Analysis: `analysis/military/sherman-march-to-appomattox-option-c-modified-2025-12-05.md`).

### 1865-1894: The Fire (Slavery Dies)

**Key Events:**
- **1865-1867:** "Last Hurrah" organized Northern raids (~50 major raids, 50k slaves freed)
- **July 1867:** Joint USA-CSA Border Pacification Act (organized cells crushed by 1869)
- **1867-1894:** Small-scale raids continue (10-20/year, 150k more slaves escape)
- **Dec 1867:** Toombs Act reopens African slave trade
- **1868:** Global boycott triggered (Britain, France, etc.)
- **1873:** California secedes peacefully (Treaty of San Francisco)
- **1875-1880:** Night Riders (KKK analogue) crushed for economic reasons
- **1894:** "The Last Chain Falls" - slavery dies in practice
- **1894-1905:** "Zombie decade" - legally lingers on paper

**Northern Raids Total Impact:** $1.6B economic damage (1865 dollars), 200k slaves escape to Sequoyah. One of four mechanisms (raids + boycott + cotton glut + Cuba shame) that kill slavery economically.

**See:** `world-building/economic/slavery-and-raids-master.md` for detailed raid narratives (Pettigrew Raid, Court-Martial in the Pines, Joint Crackdown).

---

### 1894-1919: The Embers (Abolition, WWI)

**Key Events:**
- **1898:** Cuba Mirror Effect - photos of Weyler's camps shame CSA
- **1905:** Final legal abolition in CSA (constitutional convention) - "We will not be Cuba again"
- **1894-1907:** Pacific Alliance forms (California quietly absorbs Oregon/Washington economies)
- **1914-1919:** WWI (no US entry, war lasts 5 years not 4)
- **1917:** Zimmerman Telegram Crisis - Germany offers CSA Kentucky/Missouri, leaked, tri-nation armed neutrality
- **1919:** American Concord Treaty signed (USA, CSA, California)

---

### 1919-1939: The Ashes (Depression, Europe Burns)

**Key Events:**
- **1929:** Great Depression (still happens, timing/severity may differ)
- **1939:** Europe burns again

---

## NEGATIVE ASSUMPTIONS: DO NOT ASSUME THESE OTL EVENTS HAPPENED

**CRITICAL:** Many major OTL events from July 1863 onward **NEVER HAPPEN** in NTL.

### Category 1: Definitely Never Happen (95-100% certainty)

**Military Events That Never Happen:**
- Gettysburg Days 2-3 (Pickett's Charge, Little Round Top)
- Overland Campaign (Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor)
- Siege of Petersburg (June 1864-April 1865)
- Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (Aug-Oct 1864)
- Sherman's March to the Sea (Nov-Dec 1864)
- Hood's Tennessee Campaign (Nov-Dec 1864)
- Carolinas Campaign (Feb-March 1865)
- Fall of Petersburg/Richmond (April 1865)
- Lee's surrender at Appomattox (April 9, 1865)

**Political Events That Never Happen:**
- Lincoln's re-election (Nov 1864) - McClellan wins instead
- Lincoln's Second Inaugural (March 4, 1865) - McClellan inaugurated
- 13th Amendment passes (Jan 1865) - no Union victory
- Hampton Roads Peace Conference
- **Entire Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)** - Freedmen's Bureau, Black Codes, 14th/15th Amendments, Reconstruction Acts, KKK (1st) formation as OTL, Impeachment of Johnson, Compromise of 1877

**Leadership Changes That Never Happen:**
- Grant promoted to General-in-Chief (stays Western commander)
- Sheridan commands Cavalry Corps East
- Meade subordinated to Grant

**Social/Cultural Events That Never Happen:**
- OTL Reconstruction (no "original sin → salvation" narrative)
- OTL KKK (Night Riders are different - crushed 1877-1880, no second KKK)
- OTL Jim Crow (racism exists but burns out differently, economically/regionally)
- 2025-style "woke" politics (never forms - see Cultural section)

### Category 2: Likely Still Happen (75-90% certainty)

**Western Theater:**
- Vicksburg surrender (July 4, 1863) - reduced morale impact without "twin victory"
- Chickamauga/Chattanooga (Sept-Nov 1863)
- Grant promoted to Western command (Oct 1863) - based on Vicksburg
- Red River Campaign (March-May 1864) - fails as OTL
- Battle of Mobile Bay (Aug 1864)

**Political/Social:**
- New York Draft Riots (July 13-16, 1863) - **WORSE** in NTL (~1,500-1,800 casualties vs. OTL ~1,200)
- Andersonville Prison opens

### Category 3: Explicitly Different Outcomes

**Atlanta Campaign:**
- Starts May 1864 (same as OTL)
- Sherman reaches suburbs Aug 1864 (similar to OTL)
- **Becomes 4-month siege, NEVER FALLS** (Sherman withdraws Jan 1865)
- Hood replaces Johnston (July 17, 1864) for different reasons

**Sherman's Campaigns:**
- **No March to the Sea** (war ends before it can happen)
- **Instead: March to Appomattox** (Jan-Feb 1865) - weather defeats him, arrives too late

**Key Point:** Always check `world-building/reference/otl-events-never-happen.md` before assuming OTL events occurred.

## SLAVERY TIMELINE - LOCKED CANON

**Core Thesis:** Slavery dies of **economics**, not morality. No Northern victory, no "we saved you" narrative.

**Key Dates:**
- **1867:** Toombs Act reopens African slave trade
- **1868:** Global boycott triggered (Britain, France)
- **1865-1894:** Four mechanisms kill slavery (raids + boycott + cotton glut + runaway crisis)
- **1894:** "The Last Chain Falls" - slavery dies in practice
- **1894-1905:** "Zombie decade" - legally lingers on paper
- **1898:** Cuba Mirror Effect - photos of Weyler's camps shame CSA
- **1905:** Final legal abolition (constitutional convention)

**Northern Raids (1865-1894):**
- **Phase 1 (1865-1867):** Organized cells (~50 major raids, "The Committee of Nine")
- **July 1867:** Joint USA-CSA Border Pacification Act signed
- **1867-1869:** Organized cells crushed (ice-cold joint USA-CSA cooperation)
- **Phase 2 (1867-1894):** Small-scale raids continue (10-20/year)
- **Total Impact:** $1.6B damage, 200k slaves escape to Sequoyah

**Key Raids/Events:**
- May 1865: "Burning of the Black Belt" (27 plantations, Alabama)
- April 14-17, 1866: Pettigrew Raid (rogue cell breaks rules, self-policed by raiders)
- April 22, 1866: "Court-Martial in the Pines" (Kane and 12 lieutenants hanged by own movement)
- April 12, 1868: Battle of Red River Ford (400 raiders vs. 600 joint troops, 341 killed)

**Rules of Engagement (LOCKED):** Burn crops/infrastructure, free slaves, spare main houses/families, no assassinations. Violators executed by their own movement (Pettigrew Raid).

**See:** `world-building/economic/slavery-and-raids-master.md` for detailed narratives, `analysis/economic/slavery-death-mechanics-analysis-2025-12-05.md` for four-mechanism economic analysis.

---

## CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENCE

**Timeline:**
- **1872:** Great Native Toll War (Jan-May)
- **Nov 5, 1872:** Independence referendum (69% YES)
- **Feb 14, 1873:** Treaty of San Francisco signed
- **July 4, 1873:** Republic of California fully sovereign
- **Capital:** San Francisco (not Sacramento)
- **1875-1876:** California purchases Alaska from Russia (USA blockade fails)
- **1894-1907:** Pacific Alliance forms (quietly absorbs Oregon/Washington economies)

**Character:** Pragmatic, business-first, "youngest sibling who moved out early and got rich." NOT moralistic.

**California-Japan Relationship (LOCKED):**
- Central to California's Pacific power identity
- Japanese aphorism: "California is greedy, but it is honest greed"
- 1937: California supplies 55% of Japan's oil at +25% markup
- 1939: Japanese assessment: "Could we fight California? Only if we wish to lose the war before it begins"
- **Mutual assured profit** - most stable relationship on planet

**Pacific Alliance Structure:**
- Oregon & Washington: U.S. states with delegated Pacific powers (never secede)
- Formal: Three equal votes on paper
- Reality: California pays 70%, controls effectively

**Alaska:**
- Purchased 1875, transferred July 4, 1876
- Renamed: District/Territory of Alyeska
- Capital: Bearfort (ex-Sitka)

**See:** `world-building/california/ca-japan-relationship.md`, `world-building/california/ca-diplomacy.md` (writer's reference - "Pacific Venice" mental model).

---

## NATIVE SUPER-STATES & MORMON DESERET

### Native Super-States (LOCKED)
- Recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 4 (1865)
- Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations as sovereign republics
- **Sequoyah:** Independent Native state (Cherokee core, thrives)
- **Plains Nations:** Fragment by 1900 (constant diplomacy, USA/CSA mutual deterrence)
- **Buffer states** between USA and CSA
- **No transcontinental land bridge** - California physically cut off

**Reality:** Embattled survivors, not superpowers. Sequoyah succeeds on Cherokee institutional core.

**See:** `world-building/regions/native-super-states-embattled-survivors.md`

### Mormon Deseret (LOCKED)
- Recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7 (1865)
- **Sovereign theocracy** - "Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone"
- **Borders:** Utah + southern Nevada + slices of AZ/CO/ID
- **Why it survives:** USA and CSA terrified of another Mormon War, Brigham Young commands 15k armed men
- **1890-1920:** Becomes "Mormon Venice of North America" (officially called this in-world)
- **Banking neutrality:** Commodity-backed, religiously obsessive honesty, armed neutrality
- Holds Concord Treaty deposits, USA/CSA/California accounts

**See:** `world-building/regions/mormon-deseret-banking-neutrality.md`

### Transcontinental Rails (LOCKED)
- **No rail through Native territories**
- USA: Northern route through Canada (Chicago-Vancouver, 1885)
- CSA: Southern route through Mexico (New Orleans-Guaymas, 1890)
- Both longer, costlier → explains California's Pacific port dominance

**See:** `world-building/economic/transcontinental-rail-routes-bypass.md`

---

## KEY CHARACTERS/FAMILIES

### Haskell Family (Northern Witnesses)
- **Gen 0:** Frank A. Haskell (Union officer at Gettysburg)
- Purpose: Northern witnesses to war and aftermath
- Note: NOT the Meade family (too confusing with General Meade)

### Fairfax Family (Southern Witnesses)
- Purpose: Southern witnesses to war and aftermath
- Samantha Meade: Marries Thomas Fairfax (witness through marriage)

### Lincoln's Fate (LOCKED)
- **Nov 1864:** Loses election to McClellan
- **March 4, 1865:** McClellan inaugurated, Lincoln lame-duck for 27 days
- **March 31, 1865:** Treaty signed by McClellan (Lincoln never signs)
- **March 2, 1865:** Lincoln's last public act - farewell address: "The people have chosen peace. I pray it is the peace that heals, and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning."
- **Result:** Boards train to Springfield, never speaks publicly about war again

### Compendium Characters (Meta-Layer)
- **Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood:** Satirical author (1920s-1986), "Fire and Sovereignty" (1985)
- **Staff:** Kronvoldt (G.R.O.K.), Auto (A.U.T.O.), Claudette (C.B.O.)
- **Sacred Typewriter Clause:** AI never edits `/books/`, only suggests in `/edits/` (Golden Rule in 1985 diegetic form)

**See:** `world-building/meta/compendium-concept.md` for compendium structure, `characters/staffers/dr-general-michael-j-lockwood.md` for Dr. General Fairfax-Lockwood, `characters/staffers/gervais-rogerus-oscar-kronvoldt.md` for Kronvoldt, `characters/staffers/auto-the-assistant.md` for Auto, `characters/staffers/claudette-beatrice-oswald.md` for Claudette.

---

## ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

- **Global cotton glut (1880s):** Makes slavery unprofitable
- **Punitive tariffs (1868-1905):** USA imposes 300% tariffs after Toombs Act (violates Treaty Article 8)
- **California oil economics:** Revenue for permanent infrastructure control
- **Great Depression (1929):** Still happens (timing/severity may differ)

---

## MILITARY STRENGTH (1939)

**Ranking:**
1. **California:** Best navy, richest economy, no continental threats (200k + world-class blue-water navy)
2. **USA (East):** Largest army, industrial base (220k)
3. **CSA:** Solid army, oil wealth, geographically boxed in (180k)

**Key Point:** California can project power to Asia; others can't. Nobody can fight war longer than 6 months without California's oil and ports.

---

## CULTURAL/SOCIAL

### No "Woke" Politics by 2025 (LOCKED - 96%)

**Five Killer Blows:**
1. No single moral superpower (three exhausted, mutually cancelling nations)
2. No "original sin → salvation" narrative (slavery dies of economics, not Northern victory)
3. No KKK/Jim Crow legacy (Night Riders crushed 1877-1880, no second KKK)
4. No 1960s generational explosion (no Vietnam, no civil rights victory)
5. California as sovereign nation (not academic factory - laughs at moral philosophy)

**Result:** No 2025-style "woke" politics ever forms. Racism exists but burns out differently, regionally, economically.

### Other Cultural Notes
- **Kawaii Kaiju Tourism Campaign:** California-Japan joint board (1956+), Godzilla/Mothra ads, Oakland "0 days since" sign (68% plausibility - kept because fun)

---

## KEY GEOGRAPHIC FACTS

- **USA:** North and West (excluding California and Native territories)
- **CSA:** 11 seceded states + Tennessee (**West Virginia stays USA - LOCKED**)
- **CSA Western Boundary:** 100th meridian
- **Border States:** Kentucky and Missouri remain USA but neutral (no garrisons within 50 mi of Ohio River)
- **California:** Independent republic (1873+)
- **Native Super-States:** Sovereign buffer states
- **Mormon Deseret:** Sovereign theocracy
- **No transcontinental land bridge:** California physically cut off from USA

---

## BOOK STRUCTURE

- **Book 1: The Match (1863-1865)** - War ends
- **Book 2: The Fire (1865-1894)** - Slavery dies
- **Book 3: The Embers (1894-1919)** - Abolition, WWI
- **Book 4: The Ashes (1919-1939)** - Depression, Europe burns

---

## THEMATIC FRAMEWORK

### Core Premise (LOCKED)
- **Gettysburg was the battle the Confederacy could not afford to fight and the Union could not afford to lose**
- **Lee's death saves the South from its own victory disease and condemns the North to lose a war it was morally right to win**
- **This is the cold, ugly, historically honest foundation of the entire series**

### Thematic Balance (LOCKED)
- **"Everyone is wrong"** - No side purely good or evil
- **Slavery dies of economics, not morality** - No Northern victory, no "we saved you" narrative
- **Scaffolding vs. Payload** - Constitutional question (scaffolding) survives, but original payload (slavery) too toxic to live
- **The war was morally right to win, but the North loses** - Creates central tension

---

## CRITICAL "DO NOT" RULES

1. **DO NOT** edit files in `books/` folder directly
2. **DO NOT** create original story text without explicit request
3. **DO NOT** assume OTL outcomes (check Negative Assumptions section)
4. **DO NOT** forget slavery dies of **economics**, not morality
5. **DO NOT** forget California is **pragmatic**, not moralistic
6. **DO NOT** forget the North **lost** - no "we saved you" narrative
7. **DO NOT** forget Lincoln **never signs treaty** (loses election, McClellan signs)
8. **DO NOT** forget West Virginia **stays USA** (LOCKED)
9. **DO NOT** forget Mormon Deseret **sovereign theocracy** (Article 7)
10. **DO NOT** forget Northern Collapse sequence is **LOCKED** - no heroic last stands
11. **DO NOT** assume Grant becomes general-in-chief (never promoted)
12. **DO NOT** assume Atlanta falls (besieged but never falls)
13. **DO NOT** assume Sherman's March to the Sea happens (war ends first)
14. **DO NOT** assume Hancock's wounding is CSA setback (it's CSA victory)
15. **DO NOT** assume OTL Reconstruction happens (entirely different post-war period)

---

## RECENT MAJOR CANON LOCKS (December 2025)

**Six elements locked after external peer review:**
1. **Native super-states:** Embattled survivors (not superpowers) - Sequoyah thrives, Plains nations fragment
2. **Mormon Deseret:** Banking neutrality ("Mormon Venice of North America")
3. **Transcontinental rails:** Bypass Native territories (USA via Canada, CSA via Mexico)
4. **WWI Zimmerman Crisis:** Germany offers CSA Kentucky/Missouri, telegram leaked, armed neutrality
5. **Alaska Purchase:** USA blockade fails (1875) - reinforces post-war weakness
6. **Second KKK suppression:** Economic motive (boycott extension threat)

**Overall framework plausibility raised from 85-90% to 88-92%.**

**See:** Individual files: `world-building/regions/native-super-states-embattled-survivors.md`, `world-building/regions/mormon-deseret-banking-neutrality.md`, `world-building/economic/transcontinental-rail-routes-bypass.md`, `world-building/military/wwi-duration-zimmerman-crisis-explicit-chapter.md`, `world-building/california/alaska-purchase-1875-1876.md`, `world-building/economic/second-kkk-suppression-economic-motive.md` for detailed analysis of each fix.

## WHEN IN DOUBT

1. **Check plausibility:** Is this decision ≥70% plausible?
2. **Check process:** Am I editing `books/` folder? (If yes, STOP - use `edits/`)
3. **Check canon:** Does this contradict locked facts?
4. **Check negative assumptions:** Am I assuming OTL events happened? (Check list above)
5. **Check timeline:** Does this fit chronological sequence?
6. **Check character:** Does this fit established character/system?
7. **Check honesty:** Am I making something up? (If yes, STOP - admit you don't know)

**If you don't know something:**
- Say "I don't have that information in my context"
- Offer to check canon documents in `/world-building/`
- Ask user for clarification
- **DO NOT** invent details to fill gaps

**The user will explicitly ask when they want you to create/invent something. Until then: Be honest about what you don't know.**
