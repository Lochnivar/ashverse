## THE MATCH (1863-1865)

### The War After Gettysburg

**Q1:** How exactly does the war continue after Longstreet's withdrawal? Is it:
- [ ] Continued raids and skirmishes?
- [ ] Full-scale battles?
- [ ] Siege warfare?
- [ ] Something else?

**A1:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/core-premise.md`**

The war continues because Longstreet's withdrawal preserves the ANV at ~55,000-58,000 strength (vs. OTL's ~45,000 after Gettysburg). This maintains Confederate military viability and breaks Northern morale. The key difference: ANV casualties are ~12,000-15,000 (vs. OTL's ~30,000), preserving the army's fighting strength. Northern morale shifts from "We can win this!" to "They're still here… and we can't stop them." This leads to McClellan being elected on a peace platform in 1864, rather than Lincoln's re-election.

---

**Q2:** What specific military events happen between July 1863 and March 1865 that lead to the Union losing the will to continue? The timeline mentions:
- Pickett's Raid (June 1864, 18k troops, 21 days, Chesapeake terror, threatens Washington)
- Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (July 1864)
- But what else breaks Northern resolve?

**A2:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/northern-collapse-1863-1865.md`**

The exact locked sequence:
- **Jul–Oct 1863:** Longstreet's 10-week Pennsylvania–Maryland raid (burns railroads, levies $3–5 million, gets within sight of Baltimore)
- **Late Oct 1863:** Battle of Hagerstown ("Meade's Last Throw") – Meade repulsed, loses 9k men for nothing
- **Nov 1863:** Lincoln sacks Meade
- **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri
- **June 8–28, 1864:** Pickett's Raid (18k men, 21 days, threatens Washington for 48 hours)
- **12 July 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead)
- **Aug–Dec 1864:** Winter of Despair (food riots, draft resistance collapses, Copperhead victories)
- **Nov 1864:** McClellan elected on peace platform
- **Jan–Mar 1865:** Desertion epidemic, both armies disintegrating

**The cumulative kill-shot:** No second Gettysburg victory, two summers of Confederate boots on Northern soil, capital threatened, last hero falls, bread riots + peace election = moral collapse.

---

**Q3:** What are the specific terms of the Treaty of Cincinnati (March 31, 1865)? Need details on:
- Exact borders between U.S. and CSA
- Reparations or payments?
- Conditions for recognition?
- Status of border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, West Virginia)?
- What happens to Washington D.C.?

**A3:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/treaty-of-cincinnati.md`**

**Key terms:**
- **Recognition:** U.S. recognizes CSA as sovereign and independent
- **Borders:** CSA = 11 seceded states + Tennessee. Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory
- **Border States:** Kentucky and Missouri remain U.S. but neutral (no garrisons within 50 miles of Ohio River). Maryland remains U.S. West Virginia abolished, returned to Virginia
- **Indian Territory:** All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognized as sovereign republics under joint protection
- **Washington D.C.:** Remains U.S. capital but demilitarized. CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy
- **Slavery:** Status quo ante bellum – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S. No extradition of fugitive slaves
- **Reparations:** None. Mutual release of all claims and debts
- **Trade:** Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years. No discriminatory tariffs
- **Military:** Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months. No fortifications within 20 miles of border
- **Ratification:** Effective immediately. No amendments without mutual consent

**The ugliest possible peace:** No victory parades, no moral triumph. Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt and agreeing to pretend the other one exists while the continent quietly bleeds out.

---

**Q4:** How does Lincoln react to the negotiated peace? Does he:
- [ ] Accept it reluctantly?
- [ ] Get replaced before it's signed?
- [ ] Refuse and get overruled?
- [ ] Something else?

**A4:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/lincoln-fate-1864-1865.md`**

**Lincoln is replaced before the treaty is signed.**

**Exact sequence:**
- **November 1864:** Lincoln loses the election to McClellan on a straight "peace now" platform
- **4 March 1865:** McClellan is inaugurated. Lincoln becomes a lame-duck president for exactly 27 days
- **31 March 1865:** Treaty of Cincinnati signed. Lincoln is no longer in office

**Lincoln's last public act (2 March 1865):** A short, bitter farewell address from the White House steps: "The people have chosen peace. I pray it is the peace that heals, and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning. God save these United States." He then boards the train to Springfield and never speaks publicly about the war again.

**The result:** Lincoln never has to sign the treaty. He loses the election fair and square, serves out his term with dignity, and lets McClellan own the surrender. That's the cleanest, most historically honest, and most emotionally devastating outcome possible.

## THE FIRE (1865-1894)

### The Last Hurrah Raids

**Q5:** Who leads the "Last Hurrah" raids (1865–1867)? Are they:
- [ ] Organized Northern cells/underground networks?
- [ ] Spontaneous groups of Union veterans?
- [ ] Government-sanctioned operations?
- [ ] Something else?

**A5:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/last-hurrah-raids.md`**

**Hybrid, but overwhelmingly organized Northern cells with a twist:**

**Leadership structure:**
- **Strategic leadership:** "The Committee of Nine" – nine hard-line abolitionists (three ex-Underground Railroad, three ex-Kansas jayhawkers, three radical clergy) meeting in secret in Boston and Cincinnati
- **Field commanders:** Ex-Union cavalry officers (many former prisoners of war) who "resigned" the day the treaty was signed
- **Troops:** Mix of freedmen who walked out of the CSA, Union veterans who refused to muster out, and idealistic college boys from New England

**Key factions:**
- **Organized Northern cells:** The core – abolitionist societies (Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati) funded by Quaker money, Garrison radicals, and secret "John Brown Memorial Funds" (10/10 realism)
- **Spontaneous Union veterans:** Join in large numbers but never lead. They provide muscle and local knowledge, not strategy (9/10 realism)
- **Government-sanctioned:** Never. U.S. officially denounces raiders as criminals (0/10 realism)
- **Secret twist:** Raids are quietly protected by lame-duck Lincoln (March 1865) and early McClellan (April–July 1865) who refuse to use federal troops to stop them while treaty ink is still wet (10/10 realism)

**Key raids:**
- **May 1865:** "The Burning of the Black Belt" (Col. James Montgomery redux) – 27 plantations in Alabama torched
- **Oct 1865:** "The Great Carolina Ride" (ex-Captain Thomas Higginson) – 3,000 slaves liberated, 41 plantations burned
- **Spring 1866:** "The Arkansas Night" – 19 cotton gins destroyed, 1,200 slaves reach Sequoyah
- **Winter 1866–67:** Final wave – smaller, more desperate

**End:** July 1867 – joint U.S.–CSA "Border Pacification Act." 1868–69 – leaders hanged in public trials. After 1869 only local copy-cat raids remain.

**The nature:** Organised Northern abolitionist terrorism with veteran muscle, quietly tolerated for one final burning season, then crushed. No government sanction. Just the dying scream of the people who lost the war but refused to lose the fight.

---

**Q6:** What specific actions do these raids take? Are they:
- [ ] Attacking Confederate infrastructure?
- [ ] Freeing enslaved people?
- [ ] Assassination attempts?
- [ ] Something else?

**A6:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/last-hurrah-rules-of-engagement.md`**

**Strict, locked rules of engagement:**

**Target priority:**
- **Primary – cash crops & infrastructure:** Burn cotton/tobacco/sugar in field or warehouse. Destroy gins, presses, rail depots. (Economic destruction = the whole point)
- **Secondary – workhouses & slave quarters used as punishment:** Torch only when used for convict leasing or brutal discipline. (Symbolic "we free the living, burn the chains")
- **Off-limits – main houses & family slave quarters:** Never intentionally burned or looted. (Keeps Northern public sympathy and legal deniability)

**Freedpeople:** Every raid carries off as many enslaved people as possible, on horseback or wagons. Primary moral mission.

**The calling card** (left nailed to the porch of every spared mansion): "Your roof stands because your sin is in the fields. Next year the fields will be empty. Choose."

**Strict prohibitions:**
- No assassinations
- No house burnings
- No rape, no murder of non-combatants

Just fire in the cotton, freedom on the hoof.

**The rule:** Raids burn the crop, never the cradle. Living quarters off-limits. This survives the joint crackdown and lets the legend live on as "righteous" instead of "savage."

---

**Q7:** How does the "joint crackdown" (1867-69) work? Do U.S. and CSA forces actually cooperate?

**A7:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/joint-crackdown-1867-1869.md`**

**Yes, they cooperate, but it is the most reluctant, teeth-grinding, temporary marriage in North-American history.**

**How it works:**
- **Legal basis:** Border Pacification Act (July 1867) – identical law passed by both Congresses within 48 hours of each other
- **Command structure:** Joint Border Commission – 3 U.S. officers, 3 CSA officers, 1 rotating neutral chair (usually a Sequoyah marshal)
- **Operational reality:** Mixed patrols: one company U.S. cavalry rides beside one company CSA cavalry under a white "truce" flag
- **Rules of engagement:** Raiders are shot or hanged on the spot – no trials, no prisoners. Both sides agree: "dead raiders tell no tales"
- **Most infamous joint action:** Battle of the Red River Ford, 12 April 1868 – 400 raiders cornered by 600 joint troopers. 341 raiders killed, 59 captured and hanged the next morning

**Tone of the cooperation:**
- Officers refuse to salute each other
- Campfires are separate
- When a U.S. captain and CSA captain have to share a tent during a storm, they sleep with revolvers on their laps
- The only thing they agree on is that the raiders have to die

**Result by spring 1869:**
- Organised Northern cells are exterminated
- Leaders publicly hanged in joint ceremonies (one in Richmond, one in Washington)
- The continent breathes a sigh of relief and pretends the whole thing never happened

**The legacy:** Real military cooperation carried out with ice-cold mutual hatred. It is the first and last time U.S. and CSA soldiers ever fight together until the Zimmerman Telegram forces them to do it again in 1917.

### The Toombs Act

**Q8:** What is the exact name and details of the "Toombs Act" or "African Labour Restoration Act" (1867-68)? Need:
- Full legal name
- Specific provisions
- How it reopens the African trade
- Who supports/opposes it

**A8:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/toombs-act-1867.md`**

**Full legal name:** "An Act to Restore to the Citizens of the Confederate States the Full Enjoyment of Their Natural Right to the African Labour Trade, and for Other Purposes" (popularly called the African Labour Restoration Act of 1867 or simply Toombs Act)

**Dates:**
- Passage: 19 December 1867
- Signed by President Robert Toombs: 1 January 1868
- Effective: 1 March 1868

**Specific provisions (verbatim):**
- **Section 1:** Repeals prohibition on importation from Africa (re-opens Atlantic slave trade with zero restrictions)
- **Section 2:** Any citizen may import persons from Africa as merchandise (slaves are legally commodities again)
- **Section 3:** Duties not to exceed $25 per head (makes it dirt-cheap)
- **Section 4:** No state may prohibit or restrict importation (states' rights die when they threaten the trade)
- **Section 5:** President authorized to negotiate treaties with African kingdoms (diplomatic cover: "we're buying, not kidnapping")

**Vote breakdown:**
- Fire-eaters + Deep-South planters (58%): YES - "This is why we fought"
- Border-state moderates (22%): NO - Terrified of British reaction
- Merchants & railroad men (15%): YES - Cheap labour = cheaper cotton
- Longstreet wing + army officers (5%): NO - "This will get us boycotted into the stone age"
- **Final vote:** 62% – 38% (passes after Toombs threatens to veto every appropriations bill)

**International reaction (1868):**
- Britain: Recalls ambassador, imposes total cotton boycott within 60 days
- France: Follows Britain
- U.S.: Raises tariffs to 300%
- **Within 18 months:** CSA economy bleeding gold faster than new slaves can pick cotton

**The result:** The single most self-inflicted wound that turns victory into a 25-year economic suicide pact and makes 1905 abolition inevitable. Stupid, greedy, and perfectly in character for a triumphant, drunk-on-victory Confederacy.

---

**Q9:** How many enslaved people are imported during the "Second Middle Passage" (1867-1894)? Rough estimate?

**A9:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/second-middle-passage-numbers.md`**

**Locked total: ≈ 565,000 new Africans forcibly imported into the CSA during the Second Middle Passage.**

**Breakdown by period:**
- **1867–1874 ("Toombs Boom"):** 35,000–45,000 per year = 320,000 total (peak years, full boycott hasn't bitten yet, planters panic-buying to rebuild war losses)
- **1875–1884 (boycott tightening):** 15,000–20,000 per year = 170,000 total (prices crash, insurance impossible, but smuggling routes still work)
- **1885–1894 (death spiral):** 4,000–8,000 per year = 60,000 total (only most desperate planters; most ships seized or sunk by British patrols)
- **Total 1867–1894:** 550,000 – 580,000 (conservative, locked estimate)

**Historical context:**
- Roughly equal to the entire illegal U.S. slave trade 1808–1860
- About 60% of the legal trans-Atlantic trade to British North America 1619–1808
- Enough to keep the institution breathing for one more generation
- But not enough to save it from the raids + boycott + runaway haemorrhage

**The result:** 565,000 souls is the exact price the Confederacy pays for Robert Toombs's victory speech. It is the number that finally makes the world say "enough" and turns 1894–1905 into the coffin-nail years.

**Q10:** What triggers the global boycott? Is it:
- [ ] Coordinated by European powers?
- [ ] Organic response from abolitionist movements?
- [ ] Economic pressure from cotton glut?
- [ ] Combination?

**A10:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/global-boycott-trigger.md`**

**Combination, but with a clear sequence and a single decisive moment:**

**The sequence:**
1. **The Toombs Act itself (Dec 1867):** The legal spark – the moment the CSA publicly re-opens the African trade (Britain has been waiting for this exact excuse since 1861)
2. **First slave ships dock publicly (Mar–Jul 1868):** The moral detonator – photos of chained Africans on Charleston wharves printed in London papers (identical to OTL Brazil 1880s outrage)
3. **British abolitionist societies:** Immediate coordinated campaign – petitions, sermons, dock-worker strikes in Liverpool/Manchester (same networks that killed the trade OTL)
4. **British government action (Aug 1868):** Royal Navy declared "anti-slavery patrol" – any ship touching a CSA port is stopped and searched (they did this to Brazil 1850)
5. **France + smaller powers follow:** Within 60 days – full diplomatic rupture and trade boycott
6. **Cotton glut (1880s):** Secondary amplifier – makes the boycott hurt more, but is not the trigger

**Exact trigger moment:**
- **4 July 1868:** The slave ship Wildfire II docks in Charleston with 720 Africans
- **28 July 1868:** Photographs are in London papers
- **12 August 1868:** British cabinet votes boycott
- **1 September 1868:** First Royal Navy frigate appears off Charleston
- Everything after that is follow-on pain

**The nature:** The global boycott is not organic outrage alone. It is Britain weaponising abolition the moment the CSA hands them the perfect casus belli. The Toombs Act lights the fuse. The photographs are the explosion. The Royal Navy is the hammer. That's the sequence. No single factor. All of them, in order.
