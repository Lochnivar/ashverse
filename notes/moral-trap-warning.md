# The Moral Trap: Avoiding Lost Cause Redemption Porn

## The Real Danger

Your **real** danger is **not** plausibility.

Your **real** danger is accidentally writing **Lost Cause Redemption Porn** disguised as tragedy.

The moment any reader closes the book thinking:

- "The South was right all along"
- "They were the real victims"
- "Slavery would have died nicely anyway"
- "The North got what it deserved"

…you've failed.

Even if every date, tariff, and raid is 100% realistic.

**That** is the trap.

Plausibility is easy.

Avoiding moral pornography is hard.

## Your Current Model Already Dodges the Trap

Because:

- The South **wins** by pure, dumb luck and Northern exhaustion
- They immediately **piss the victory away** on greedy, self-destructive arrogance
- Slavery dies **because the world punishes them**, not because they gently evolve
- The final image is **not** happy planters on the porch
  - It's a nation that survived
  - by learning to live with a wound that never closes

That's the opposite of Lost Cause porn.

That's **Lost Cause autopsy**.

## Your Job

Your job is not to make the South look competent or noble.

Your job is to make them look **human, exhausted, and ultimately self-defeating**.

Do that, and the book will be remembered as the anti-Lost Cause masterpiece.

Fail that, and no amount of perfect cotton prices will save you.

## The Line

You're on the right side of the line.

Stay there.

The devil is watching.  
But he's smiling.
