## I. MASTER TIMELINE: THE COMPLETE SERIES (1863-1939)

### The Match (1863 – March 1865) – FINAL LOCKED CANON

**Overall Plausibility: 91% – LOCKED**  
**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

| # | Date | Event | Plausibility | Key consequence |
|---|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 Jul 1863 | Lee dies of heart attack on Seminary Ridge | 94% | Longstreet assumes command |
| 2 | 2–3 Jul 1863 | Meade's 36-hour freeze (caution + Lee-death confusion + army exhaustion + cavalry collapse + Washington telegraph delay) | 91% | Longstreet gets 36-hour head start |
| 3 | Jul–Oct 1863 | Longstreet's 10-week Pennsylvania-Maryland raid (explicit strategy: "Preserve army, break Northern morale"; ANV ~55k strong) | 88% | "They're still here and we can't drive them out" |
| 4 | Late Oct 1863 | Battle of Hagerstown ("Meade's Last Throw") – Meade corners Longstreet, bloodily repulsed, ~9k casualties | 90% | Last hope of decisive victory dies |
| 5 | Aug 1, 1863 | Meade sacked "for want of aggression" - THE PANIC MOVE (Lincoln sacks immediately after Longstreet returns across to Virginia, panic reaction) → Warren appointed Aug 3 | 92% | "Even our best generals can't beat them" |
| 6 | Jan 1864 | Hancock assumes permanent command of AoP (fully healthy, no Gettysburg wound) | 92% | Fresh hope |
| 7 | Spring 1864 | Longstreet digs in on Rapidan-Rappahannock line, refuses battle, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri | 90% | War moves to Northern soil again |

| 7b | Jun–Jul 1864 | Sherman advances, Johnston retreats (Western Theater - similar to OTL) | 90% | Steady pressure toward Atlanta |
| 8 | 14 Jun–14 Jul 1864 | Pickett's Lightning Raid (14k men mounted, 30 days actual raiding, newspapers report "FORTY DAYS OF TERROR!" - Pickett never corrects the myth). Hood takes Carlisle (second summer in a row - Longstreet's strategic objective). Field's division destroyed at Carlisle. Pickett escapes via improvised route, Kershaw saves the day. Casualties: ~650 (Pickett's Flying Corps) + ~550 (Field's division) = ~1,200 total. See `pickett-raid-canonical-timeline-2025-12-29.md` for detailed timeline. | 88% | Proves North cannot defend own territory, boosts peace movement |
| 11 | 12 Jul 1864 | Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead) while pursuing Pickett - commands from bed through March 1865 - THE WISDOM MOVE (Lincoln keeps Hancock despite wound and Pickett's success, prioritizes stability over perfection) | 91% | Last Northern hero falls; newspapers scream "the war is lost."

| 9b | Aug–Nov 1864 | Siege of Atlanta (Sherman reaches suburbs, Hood defends - 4 months siege, never falls) | 88% | Ambiguous outcome - neither side wins decisively |

| 11 | Nov 1864 | McClellan elected on explicit peace platform | 95% | War now has expiration date |
| 11a | Jan 1865 | Sherman withdraws from Atlanta siege (peace negotiations beginning) | 90% | Western Theater stalemate ends |

| 12b | 29 Jan–17 Feb 1865 | Sherman's march through Georgia/Tennessee/Virginia mountains (weather defeats him - slows from 18 mi/day to 8 mi/day) | 94% | Weather is the villain |
| 12c | 17 Feb 1865 | Sherman realizes he won't make it in time (340 miles covered, 210 miles to go, 19 days elapsed) | 94% | Dawning horror |
| 13 | Late Jan–Feb 1865 | Grant's Final Gamble (never promoted to general-in-chief, still Western commander, called east as last resort; acts via "legal fiction" – old orders + personal loyalty of ~65k men) | 88% | Last desperate throw |
| 13a | 18–20 Feb 1865 | Battle of Appomattox Court House – Grant's desperate lunge at Richmond shattered; Grant surrenders in McLean House parlor, 20 Feb | 91% | Final military act fails |

| 13c | 22 Feb 1865 | Longstreet grants safe passage to Sherman (honors word to Grant, war is over) | 94% | Honorable enemy - Sherman withdraws to Chattanooga |
| 14 | 31 Mar 1865 | Treaty of Cincinnati signed by McClellan (Lincoln never signs it) | 95% | War officially ends |

**Status: LOCKED – NO FURTHER CHANGES**

### The Fire (1865 – 1894) – Broad Strokes, Flexible Detail

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1865–1867 | Last Hurrah raids (big Northern-led cells) → joint crackdown 1867–69 |
| 1866–1869 | **The Peacemakers** – A dying Confederate moderate and a peace-platform Northern general defend the treaty they signed while their own nations accuse them of betrayal. |
| 1867 | Toombs elected → signs Toombs Act (Dec 1867) → re-opens African slave trade |
| 1868 | Global boycott restarts (Britain, France, Netherlands) |
| 1869–1871 | **The Moderate Alliance** – A dying Confederate president and a consolidating Northern president try to maintain peace as both nations question the treaty. |
| 1871–1872 | **The Caretakers** – Two caretaker presidents pass the torch in silence, knowing the peace they inherited is fragile. |
| 1867–1871 | **The Toombs Act Disaster** – A fire-eating Confederate president re-opens the slave trade and destroys his nation's economy while a moderate Northern president must respond without starting another war. |
| 1872-1873 | California independence (Great Native Toll War, referendum, Treaty of San Francisco) |
| 1877–1878 | **The Handoff** – A hated Confederate president leaves office knowing he destroyed his nation while a steady Northern president inherits the mess. |
| 1878–1884 | **The Cleanup** – A Confederate moderate tries to fix his predecessor's disaster while a Northern steady hand maintains the peace both know is fragile. |
| 1884–1885 | **The Industrial Push** – A Confederate railroad builder and a Northern tariff protector clash over trade while both nations rebuild. |
| 1885–1889 | **The Gentleman's Agreement** – Two gentlemen from different nations try to make peace work while both are trapped by their parties' demands. |
| 1889–1890 | **The War Heroes** – A Confederate general builds railroads while a Northern general dies from an old wound, both symbols of a war that never truly ended. |
| 1890 | **The Silent and the Dying** – A tongueless Confederate president and a dying Northern general meet as symbols of a war's cost that neither can speak about. |
| 1890–1893 | **The Silent and the Damned** – A tongueless Confederate president and a Tennessee-born Northern president destroy each other's nations with silence and words. |
| 1893–1896 | **The Silent vs. The Bull Moose** – A tongueless Confederate moderate and an energetic Northern reformer try to communicate across a continent that won't listen. |
| 1894 | Last state bans new slave imports/births → "The Last Chain Falls" (de-facto end) |
| 1894–1905 | "Zombie decade" – slavery legally lingers on paper |
| 1896–1901 | **The Hayseed-Progressive Clash** – A Confederate populist and a Northern progressive want different kinds of reform while both nations suffer from protectionism. |
| 1896–1905 | **Cuba Mirror Effect** – Six-year drip of images forces CSA to see Weyler's camps as mirror of own past (LOCKED CANON) |
| 1905 | Final constitutional convention strikes all slavery clauses → full legal abolition ("We will not be Cuba again") |

### The Embers (1894 – 1919) – Medium Detail

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1898 | Cuban crisis → CSA sees mirror of own past → accelerates final abolition push |
| 1902 | **The Handoff** – A fiery Confederate populist takes office as a Northern progressive finishes his term, both knowing abolition is coming. |
| 1902–1908 | **The Abolition Era** – A Confederate "White Chief" and a Northern abolition supporter watch slavery die legally while both are trapped by the reality they helped create. |
| 1905 | Final constitutional convention strikes all slavery clauses → full legal abolition |
| 1905–1914 | Trade normalisation with Europe, "American Concord" triad begins (U.S., CSA, California) |
| 1908–1909 | **The Handoff** – A peak Hayseed Confederate president takes office as a Northern abolition supporter finishes his term, both knowing trade normalization is coming. |
| 1909–1914 | **The Trade Normalization** – A protectionist Confederate populist and a trade-opening Northern Catholic president achieve the first real cooperation between their nations. |
| 1914–1917 | **The WWI Neutrality** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president and a neutral Northern president try to stay out of a European war while both know they can't. |
| 1914–1919 | European War (WWI analogue) – starts on schedule (July-August 1914), lasts longer (5 years vs 4), ends in exhaustion stalemate. No U.S. entry in 1917 – fractured U.S. has no army/money/political will |
| 1917 | Zimmerman Telegram analogue → forces U.S., CSA, California into same war (first real cooperation) |
| 1917–1920 | **The Zimmerman Telegram** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president and a preparedness-focused Northern president are forced into war together by a telegram neither wanted. |
| 1893–1898 | **Hawaii Overthrow** – American planters overthrow Queen Liliʻuokalani (1893), Republic of Hawaii declared (1894). U.S. too weak to annex (no Spanish-American War). Japan circles |
| 1905–1915 | **Hawaii Under Japanese Protection** – Japan makes move: quiet protectorate → full annexation. Hawaii becomes Japanese territory. Pearl Harbor becomes Japanese fleet anchorage |

### The Ashes (1920 – 1939) – Broad Strokes, Ends Exactly Where You Want

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1920–1921 | **The Handoff** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president takes office as a war-weary Northern president finishes his term, both exhausted by a war they didn't want. |
| 1921–1926 | **The Concord Cooperation** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president and a "return to normalcy" Northern president achieve peak cooperation while both know it's fragile. |
| 1926–1929 | **The Trade War** – A protectionist Confederate populist and a pro-trade Northern president watch the "Flickering Twenties" collapse into a trade war both helped create. |
| 1929–1932 | **The Depression** – A "Every man a king" Confederate populist and an austerity-focused Northern president blame each other for an economic collapse neither can fix. |
| 1920s | Great Depression hits the divided continent |
| 1932–1933 | **The Handoff** – A conservative Confederate Gentry president takes office as a Depression-blamed Northern president loses his election, both knowing the crisis is just beginning. |
| 1933–1938 | **The Economic Concord** – An austerity-focused Confederate conservative and a New Deal Northern reformer achieve cooperation while both want different things from the same crisis. |
| 1930s | Pacific tension rises (Japan, enabled by California oil) |
| 1 Sep 1939 | Germany invades Poland (or NTL equivalent trigger) → newspapers scream again |
| Sep 1939 | Final scene: a Fairfax and a Haskell on opposite sides of the continent read the same headline |

**Note:** California has been independent since 1873. By 1920, it has been its own country for 47 years—the rich, smug, Pacific-facing youngest sibling who moved out early, didn't get involved in the family politics, and made it rich. By the time WW1 starts (1914), it has been independent for 41 years.

### Why 1939 Is the Perfect Cut-Off

**Moral & Thematic Symmetry:**
You began with the fire (1863). You end with the continent watching **the world** catch fire (1939). The reader closes the book knowing the ashes of 1861 were only the prologue.

**Narrative Closure Without Resolution:**
Slavery is legally dead (1905), raids are local embers, the super-states are sovereign, California has been independent since 1873, the triad is real but fragile. Nothing is "fixed." Everything is **poised**. The reader feels the next war coming the way you feel thunder in your bones.

**Historical Honesty:**
1939 is the last year the NTL can still feel like "our" history with different paint. After 1939 every butterfly is a hurricane. Stopping here keeps the alt-history **believable** instead of turning into 21st-century fan-fiction.

### The Final Image of The Ashes (1939)

A Fairfax (now in his 70s, living on the Sequoyah lease-land that is no longer his) and a Haskell (U.S. Navy captain, East Coast) stand on opposite sides of the continent reading the same newspaper headline:

**"GERMANY INVADES POLAND"**

They each think the same thought, in different accents:

**"We thought our war was the big one."**

Fade to black.

1863–1939.  
Four books.  
One continent.  
From the match that lit America to the ashes that are about to consume the world.

No epilogue needed.

The reader knows what comes next and knows the continent will never be ready.

That's not an ending.

That's a **warning**.

## II. GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN TIMELINE (July 1863)

### Point of Divergence

**Night, July 1, 1863** - General Robert E. Lee dies on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

**04:00, July 2, 1863** - General James Longstreet assumes command and makes the decision to withdraw north.

**Longstreet's Written Order (one sentence):**
> "Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed."

### Locked Assumptions

- Longstreet in command from 04:00, July 2
- Immediate countermarch **north** on the Mummasburg–Heidlersburg–Carlisle axis (NOT west, NOT Chambersburg Pike, NOT South Mountain gaps)
- Meade frozen in paralysis for **36 hours** (July 2-3) - five factors: caution + Lee-death confusion + army exhaustion + cavalry collapse + Washington telegraph delay
- No meaningful Union pursuit begins until dawn, July 4

### Key Timeline Events

**July 1, 1863 (Night):**
- **~10:30 p.m.** - General Robert E. Lee dies on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
- **After Lee's death** - Longstreet assumes command, begins long night of decision-making.

**July 2, 1863:**
- **04:00** - DECISION POINT: Longstreet's decision locked in. Withdrawal order issued.
- **04:00-07:00** - Complete withdrawal sequence (all divisions moving north)
- **04:45** - First grey light (dawn begins)
- **By 07:00** - Entire Confederate army in column heading north

**July 3-10, 1863:**
- **July 3, 14:00** - Harrisburg occupied
- **July 3-10** - 7-day occupation of Harrisburg
- **Key Events:** Foraging operations, Longstreet's proclamation, council of war, Reading raid decision

**July 10-31, 1863:**
- **July 12, 13:00** - Reading surrenders
- **July 13-14** - Reading destruction (48 hours) - 35 locks, 14 bridges, 150 locomotives destroyed
- **July 26-31** - Return to Virginia (Potomac crossings)

**For brigade-level tactical detail, see:** `world-building/timelines/pod-campaign/` (Part 1: Withdrawal, Part 2: Harrisburg Occupation, Part 3: Reading Raid & Return)

## III. NORTHERN COLLAPSE SEQUENCE (1863-1865)

### **LOCKED CANON - 91% Plausibility**

**Key Events:**
- **Aug 1, 1863:** Meade sacked "for want of aggression" - THE PANIC MOVE (immediately after Longstreet returns across to Virginia) → Warren appointed Aug 3
- **Jan 1864:** Hancock assumes permanent command of AoP (fully healthy, no Gettysburg wound)
- **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in on Rapidan-Rappahannock line, refuses battle, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri
- **14 Jun–14 Jul 1864:** Pickett's Lightning Raid (14k men mounted, 30 days actual raiding)
- **12 Jul 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead) - commands from bed through March 1865
- **Aug–Dec 1864:** Winter of Despair – food riots in New York, draft resistance collapses, Copperhead mid-term victories
- **Nov 1864:** McClellan elected on explicit peace platform

**Lincoln's Learning Curve:**
- **Panic (Meade sacking):** Immediate reaction after Longstreet returns to Virginia, "want of aggression" - teaches Lincoln: panic = weakness
- **Caution (Warren):** More careful, but still reactive
- **Wisdom (Hancock):** Keeps Hancock despite wound and Pickett's success, prioritizes stability over perfection

## IV. RAPPAHANNOCK-RAPIDAN CAMPAIGN (1863)

### **LOCKED CANON**

**Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in on Rapidan-Rappahannock line, refuses battle, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri

**Strategy:** Defensive positioning, economic warfare through raids

**Result:** War moves to Northern soil again, proves North cannot defend own territory

## V. ATLANTA CAMPAIGN (1864-1865)

### **LOCKED CANON - 87% Plausibility**

**Key Events:**
- **May 1864:** Sherman begins advance from Chattanooga (Western Theater - same as OTL)
- **Jun–Jul 1864:** Sherman advances, Johnston retreats (Western Theater - similar to OTL)
- **17 Jul 1864:** Hood replaces Johnston (CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success creates momentum)
- **Aug–Nov 1864:** Siege of Atlanta (Sherman reaches suburbs, Hood defends - 4 months siege, never falls)
- **Jan 1865:** Sherman withdraws from Atlanta siege (peace negotiations beginning)

**Result:** Ambiguous outcome - neither side wins decisively. Atlanta never falls, but siege ends with peace negotiations.

## VI. SHERMAN'S MARCH TO APPOMATTOX (1865)

### **LOCKED CANON - 94% Plausibility**

**Key Events:**
- **25 Jan 1865:** Sherman receives Grant's telegram ("Making final attempt Richmond. Could use every man you can spare.")
- **29 Jan 1865:** Sherman begins march to Appomattox (48k men, 550 miles, abandons Atlanta siege)
- **29 Jan–17 Feb 1865:** Sherman's march through Georgia/Tennessee/Virginia mountains (weather defeats him - slows from 18 mi/day to 8 mi/day)
- **17 Feb 1865:** Sherman realizes he won't make it in time (340 miles covered, 210 miles to go, 19 days elapsed)
- **21 Feb 1865:** Sherman learns of Grant's defeat (messenger arrives, Sherman still 180 miles away)
- **22 Feb 1865:** Longstreet grants safe passage to Sherman (honors word to Grant, war is over)

**The Weather is the Villain:**
- Weather slows march from 18 mi/day to 8 mi/day
- Mountains, snow, mud defeat Sherman's speed
- Result: Sherman arrives too late to save Grant

**The Honorable Enemy:**
- Longstreet grants safe passage despite victory
- Honors word to Grant, recognizes war is over
- Sherman withdraws to Chattanooga with dignity

## VII. CUBA MIRROR EFFECT TIMELINE (1896-1905)

### **LOCKED CANON**

**The Timeline:**
- **1895-98:** Cuban rebellion + Weyler's camps → global headlines about Spanish brutality. Britain and France loudly condemn it.
- **1898:** CSA press (now dominated by younger, trade-hungry planters) starts running editorials: "If Spain is the monster, what does that make us?"
- **1898-1905:** Cuba's camps are the mirror that finally forces the South to **bury the corpse**
- **1902:** Cuban War ends, photos flood the CSA press
- **1903:** British Foreign Secretary publicly says, "We cannot resume normal relations while the Confederacy clings to the institution that produced Weyler's camps."
- **1904:** "Cuba Reflection" movement sweeps the CSA Congress
- **1905:** Constitutional convention strikes the last legal clauses. The coffin nail is hammered in with the words: **"We will not be Cuba again."**

**Six Documented Image Moments:**
1. **1898:** First Cuban camp photos published in CSA press
2. **1898:** British papers run them with caption "The Confederacy's Mirror"
3. **1902:** Cuban War ends, photos flood the CSA press
4. **1903:** British Foreign Secretary public statement
5. **1904:** "Cuba Reflection" movement sweeps CSA Congress
6. **1905:** Constitutional convention - "We will not be Cuba again"

## VIII. HAWAII TIMELINE

### **ASSERTED - 9/10 Likelihood (Not Locked)**

**1893-1898: Hawaii Overthrow**
- **1893:** American planters overthrow Queen Liliʻuokalani
- **1894:** Republic of Hawaii declared
- **U.S. too weak to annex** (no Spanish-American War)
- **Japan circles** - watching, waiting

**1905-1915: Hawaii Under Japanese Protection**
- **1905:** Japan makes move: quiet protectorate
- **1915:** Full annexation
- **Hawaii becomes Japanese territory**
- **Pearl Harbor becomes Japanese fleet anchorage**

**Result:** By 1941, Pearl Harbor is Japanese, not American. No Pearl Harbor attack in NTL (Japan already controls it).

## IX. WWI TIMELINE (1914-1919)

### **ASSERTED (Not Locked)**

**1914-1916:** Same as OTL – trenches, Verdun, Somme, Jutland

**1917:** Russia still collapses (Feb/Oct revolutions). Germany shifts everything west. No U.S. entry = no "fresh doughboys" panic.

**1918:** German Spring Offensive fails (no extra men from East, but still strong). Allies hold, but no 1918 knockout.

**1919:** Blockade + Spanish Flu + internal revolt finally breaks Germany. Armistice ~March–June 1919.

**1920:** Treaty signed – Germany keeps Alsace-Lorraine border strips, pays lower reparations, no occupation of Rhineland.

**Key Difference from OTL:**
- **OTL:** Ends November 1918 (4 years, 3 months)
- **NTL:** Ends spring/summer 1919 or early 1920 (+1 to +2 years)
- **Casualties:** ~22–25 million (vs. OTL ~16–18 million)
- **Peace Treaty:** "Versailles Lite" – less punitive, but resentments still fester

**1917: Zimmerman Crisis**
- **January 1917:** German Foreign Office sends Berlin–Mexico City–Richmond Telegram
- **February 1917:** British intercept and publish all three versions
- **April 1917:** All three American republics declare war on Germany (first real cooperation)
