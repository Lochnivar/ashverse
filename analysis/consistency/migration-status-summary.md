## REMAINING: PHASE 6 - ARCHIVE

### Status: Ready to Start

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Create archive folder structure
2. Move old detail files to archive (conservative approach)
3. Update references in canon/notes files
4. Mark archived files as deprecated

**Files to Archive:**
- `world-building/core/` (4 files) - Consolidated into `01-core-foundation.md`
- `world-building/economic/` (7 files) - Consolidated into `02-economic-systems.md`
- `world-building/political/` (7 files) - Consolidated into `03-political-systems.md`
- `world-building/military/` (7 files) - Consolidated into `04-military-history.md`
- `world-building/regions/` (7 files) - Consolidated into `05-regions-and-nations.md`
- `world-building/california/` (13 files) - Consolidated into `05-regions-and-nations.md`
- `world-building/timelines/` (10+ files) - Consolidated into `06-timelines.md`
- `world-building/thematic/` (3 files) - Consolidated into `07-thematic-framework.md`
- `world-building/reference/` (6 files) - Consolidated into `08-reference-data.md`
- `world-building/treaties/` (4 files) - Consolidated into `03-political-systems.md`

**Files to Keep:**
- `world-building/economic/northern-raids-comprehensive-catalog.md` - Large detail file, keep as reference

## MIGRATION RESULTS

### Files Consolidated
- **Before:** ~67+ world-building detail files
- **After:** 8 master files + 1 detail file (northern-raids catalog)
- **Reduction:** ~85% reduction in world-building files

### Dependency Tracking
- **Files with tracking:** 9 files
- **Dependencies tracked:** All pointing to consolidated master files
- **Hash system:** Working correctly

### System Status
- ✅ Consistency checker: Working
- ✅ Cascade tool: Working
- ✅ Butterfly effect tracking: Working
- ✅ Hash verification: All dependencies verified
