# Institute of Economic Concordance — Appomattox College Annex

**Established:** 1931  
**Location:** Institute Hall, Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy  
**Status:** Neutral empirical observatory (no policy role)  
**Date Created:** December 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Optional depth document — tracks trade flows and interdependence

## Core Concept

The Institute of Economic Concordance serves as a neutral tracker of continental trade flows and economic interdependence. Founded amid the Great Depression, it measures how deeply the three North American shards rely on each other's markets, supply chains, and capital flows.

## Founding and Mission

**Founding (1931):**  
Proposed by California faculty amid Depression-era trade disruptions. The crisis reveals how deeply interconnected the shards have become — when one economy falters, all suffer. USA and CSA faculty approve tracking as "economic self-awareness tool." California funds discreetly.

**Charter Mission Statement:**  
> "The Institute of Economic Concordance exists to measure, not manage, the economic bonds between our shards. We track flows; we do not direct them. Our data reflects reality — the cold calculus of profit and loss that keeps peace when politics cannot."

## Structure

- **Faculty:** Rotating 50/50 USA/CSA split; California overseer enforces neutrality
- **Output:** Annual **Concordance Ledger** — tables and charts of:
  - Cross-border investment flows
  - Supply chain dependencies
  - Trade volume by sector
  - Estimated "friction taxes" (economic costs of tensions/disruptions)
  - Projected impact of hypothetical border closures
- **Distribution:** Mailed free to governments, trade ministries, and alumni on January 1 each year

## Key Metrics

**The Concordance Ledger tracks:**
- Investment flows (USA→CSA, CSA→USA, California involvement)
- Supply chain dependencies (e.g., CSA oil → USA refineries → California ports)
- Trade volumes by sector (agriculture, manufacturing, resources)
- Friction taxes (estimated economic costs of border tensions)
- Interdependence ratios (what % of each shard's GDP depends on cross-border trade)

**Example Finding (1935):**  
"Estimated friction tax from 1933 tariff dispute: $450M (USA), $320M (CSA). Supply chain disruptions affected 12% of continental manufacturing output."

## Disclaimers Against Misuse

**Disclaimer Example (1934):**  
> The Institute protests commercial exploitation of Concordance Ledger data by industrial consortia adopting dependency ratios as leverage in trade negotiations. The Ledger measures interdependence; it is not a weapon for economic warfare.

## Significance and Ironies

- Shows greed as peace's true keeper — when profit depends on cooperation, politics follow
- Governments ignore disclaimers and use data pragmatically (California most effectively)
- No moral progress celebrated — just cold metrics showing economic reality
- Demonstrates that pragmatism, not virtue, maintains continental peace

**Ashverse Fit:**  
Reinforces the theme that economics drives tolerance. When discrimination is unprofitable, it fades. The Concordance Ledger proves that all three shards are economically married, even if politically divorced.

**Plausibility:** 82–86% (Depression-era economic tracking natural; pragmatic focus avoids moral advocacy)
