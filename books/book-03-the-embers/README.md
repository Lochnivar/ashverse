## Book Blurb
The fire has burned, and now the embers glow. From 1895 to 1919, the continent learns to make money together while still hating each other. Decades of raids, boycotts, and realpolitik have reshaped the continent. In 1905, slavery is finally abolished in the Confederacy—twenty years after it died in practice. The legal structure finally catches up to economic and social reality.

But the embers still glow. The continent has settled into patterns of economic cooperation and mutual profit, even as old hatreds and divisions remain. Trade relationships develop. Borders stabilize. Money flows across the continent. But the hatred remains—just buried beneath the necessity of commerce.

The Fairfax and Haskell families have watched it all unfold, their multi-generational perspective providing insight into the slow arc of history. They see the patterns: cooperation born of necessity, profit trumping principle, the continent learning to function while still divided.

The embers can still catch fire again.

## Core Plot
From 1895 to 1919, the continent learns to make money together while still hating each other. The final legal end of slavery comes in 1905, but this is just one thread in a complex tapestry. The continent has developed new patterns of interaction: trade relationships, border agreements, economic cooperation, and ongoing tensions.

The narrative explores how the continent functions in this new normal—cooperation born of economic necessity, profit trumping old hatreds, but the hatreds remaining beneath the surface. The Native super-states are established powers. The Confederacy has survived but transformed. The Union has adapted to multiple neighbors.

The Fairfax and Haskell families provide multi-generational perspective, seeing patterns that others miss: how money can unite what politics divides, how hatred can coexist with commerce, how the continent learns to function while still divided. New challenges emerge: industrialization, changing demographics, new technologies, and the shadow of what's happening in Europe.

2. **First Plot Point:** The Zombie Years (1894-1905) - Everyone knows slavery is a corpse. Convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping have fully replaced it.
3. **Midpoint:** The continent learns to make money together while still hating each other
4. **Second Plot Point:** 1905 - Final constitutional convention strikes every remaining slavery clause. Full legal abolition + European trade normalisation.
5. **Climax:** "The Coffin Nail" - The bureaucratic end. The corpse is finally buried.
6. **Resolution:** The continent settles into patterns of economic cooperation despite political division
