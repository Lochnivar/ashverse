## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not Just a Hero** - Has flaws, makes mistakes
- **Not Invincible** - Can be wounded, can fail
- **Not Perfect** - Sometimes reckless, sometimes wrong
- **Not a Martyr** - Survives, must live with defeat

### Key Contradictions
- **Charismatic but Vulnerable** - Inspires but can be hurt
- **Aggressive but Caring** - Attacks but cares about men
- **Confident but Uncertain** - Appears sure but has doubts
- **Hero but Defeated** - Inspires but war is lost

### Writing Tips
- Show his charisma through others' reactions
- Contrast his confidence with war's reality
- Use his relationship with Armistead for emotional weight
- Show his care for men through small moments
- Let his vulnerability emerge when wounded

## Appearances

### Book 1: The Match (1863-1865)
- **Primary Role:** Last Northern hero, falls at critical moment
- **Key Scenes:**
  - January 1864: Takes command, army morale lifts
  - June-July 1864: Pursues Pickett's raid
  - July 12, 1864: Wounded, stretcher scene with Armistead
- **POV:** Can be POV character, or seen through others' eyes

### Post-War (1865+)
- **Role:** Remembered as the hero who tried
- **Status:** Survives but war is lost
- **Legacy:** Tragic figure, last hope that failed

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**Brian Mallon as Winfield Scott Hancock in "Gettysburg" (1993)**
- **Accuracy:** He already is Hancock for an entire generation. Keep him. Let him age twenty years and come back broken.
- **Strengths:** Mallon's natural authority and soft Pennsylvania accent are untouchable. Shows Hancock's inspirational quality and personal courage.
- **NTL Adaptation:** In NTL he's the last hope, so more weight on his shoulders. The same charismatic presence but with more pressure. The wounding scene needs more emotional weight - especially the stretcher scene with Armistead
- **Key Scene Reference:** The stretcher scene with Armistead—two Gettysburg alums (Mallon + whoever plays Armistead) looking at each other across the divide one last time. The silence would be deafening.

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Hancock | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Russell Crowe** (1995-2005 prime) | *Gladiator*, *Master and Commander*, *Cinderella Man* | The single best choice who ever lived. 6'2", broad-shouldered, voice like gravel wrapped in velvet, and the ability to make an entire army believe in him with one look. Crowe's Maximus is already 90% NTL Hancock; just give him a better haircut and a worse war. | The rally speech when he takes command in January 1864: "If I'm here, we can't lose. And I'm here." Crowe could make grown men in the audience stand up and cheer… and then cry when he falls six months later. |
| **Jon Hamm** (modern prime) | *Mad Men*, *Baby Driver*, *Top Gun: Maverick* | The best living American actor who can play 110% charisma while bleeding out. Hamm's Don Draper charm + Maverick physicality = Hancock's "larger than life" presence perfectly. | Riding at the head of the pursuit column in June 1864, cape flying, shouting "We will catch Pickett or die trying!"—and then actually dying trying. |
| **Joel Edgerton** | *Warrior*, *The Gift*, *Loving* | Underrated beast at playing noble, physically imposing men who lose everything with dignity. Edgerton's quiet intensity would make the wounding feel like the death of hope itself. | The moment he realizes he's been shot and still tries to stay in the saddle long enough to give one last order. Edgerton could make you feel the exact second the myth dies. |
| **Chris Hemsworth** (controversial wild card) | *Rush*, *Extraction* | Only if we want the sheer physical god version of Hancock. Hemsworth has the size, the voice, and—crucially—the ability to play a man who believes he's invincible right up to the second he isn't. | The exact moment the bullet hits—Hemsworth's face going from godlike certainty to human shock in one frame. |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, Hancock is the last hope, not just another commander
- **The burden:** Charismatic leader who carries the weight of being the Union's final chance
- **The fall:** The wounding scene needs maximum emotional weight - the last Northern hero falls
- **Physical presence:** 6'2", broad-shouldered, larger than life - the man who makes armies believe
