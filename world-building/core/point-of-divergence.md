# Point of Divergence

## Exact Moment
**Date:** July 1, 1863  
**Time:** ~10:30 p.m.  
**Location:** Gettysburg, Pennsylvania  
**Specific Location:** Widow Leister house (Lee's headquarters tent)

## OTL (Our Timeline)
Lee, exhausted and already showing signs of heart trouble, retires for the night believing the first day's fighting has been a Confederate success.

## NTL (AshVerse Timeline)
After nightfall, while dictating orders and still furious that Ewell failed to take Cemetery Hill, Lee suffers a fatal cardiac event in his headquarters tent at the Widow Leister house. He collapses mid-sentence and dies within minutes, surrounded by staff officers.

## Immediate Aftermath

### 10:47 p.m., July 1, 1863
Longstreet is summoned to Lee's headquarters.

### The Long Night (July 1-2, 1863)
Longstreet spends the entire night alone with:
- Lee's corpse
- The weight of command he already knew was his (Davis had established the succession months ago, and Lee had briefed him personally)
- The knowledge that:
  - The Union now holds the high ground
  - Lee's last verbal order was "attack at dawn"
  - Longstreet's own instinct is to withdraw while the army is still intact

### 4:12 a.m., July 2, 1863
Longstreet quietly writes the order that ends the battle that never was:

**"The army will withdraw northwest at first light.  
We leave the field to the enemy,  
but we take the war with us."**

## Consequences
- The Army of Northern Virginia withdraws intact
- Gettysburg does not become the decisive Union victory of OTL
- The war continues in a different form
- Eventually leads to negotiated peace and Confederate independence
- The match has been struck - everything flows from this moment

## Key Details
- **Lee's Last Words:** Mid-sentence while dictating orders
- **Lee's Last Order (Verbal):** "attack at dawn"
- **Lee's State of Mind:** Still furious that Ewell failed to take Cemetery Hill
- **Longstreet's Decision:** Withdraw to preserve the army
- **Command Structure:** Longstreet was already established as second in command - well-established chain of command, no dramatic reveal needed
- **The Order:** Written at 4:12 a.m., July 2, 1863

## Significance
This is the exact moment where history diverges. Everything in the AshVerse timeline flows from Longstreet's decision to withdraw rather than attack. The phrase "We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us" becomes emblematic of the entire series - the war continues, just in different forms, for decades to come.
