# American vs. European Anti-Semitism

**Status:** LOCKED CANON  
**Date Created:** December 27, 2025  
**Plausibility:** 88-92%

## Core Thesis

American anti-Semitism fades through economic pragmatism and indifference. European anti-Semitism continues unbroken because no Holocaust shock disrupts 500 years of baseline persecution.

## Why America Is Different

### No Feudal/Guild Heritage

- America never had "Jews can't own land → forced into moneylending → resented" system
- No centuries of institutionalized exclusion creating embedded resentment
- Jews arrive as immigrants alongside other immigrants, not as ancient scapegoats

### Spread-Spectrum Nativism

- American prejudice spreads across Irish, Italians, Poles, Jews - not focused on one group
- **"At least they weren't Irish"**: Historically accurate - Catholics catch more heat in many periods
- Prejudice diluted across multiple targets rather than concentrated

### Economic Mobility

- American capitalism rewards competence
- Jewish success in business/professions → normalization → "They're just good at business"
- Money talks louder than prejudice in market economy

## American Spectrum (1939)

| Nation | Tolerance Rating | Character |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **California** | 7/10 | Pragmatic meritocracy - "Can you do the job?" |
| **Texas** | 6.5/10 | Pragmatic like California, oil wealth needs talent |
| **USA** | 6/10 | Casual prejudice, country club exclusions, no pogroms |
| **CSA** | 5.5/10 | Preoccupied with Black/white dynamics, Jews mostly ignored |
| **Sequoyah** | 6.5/10 | Pragmatic - "You respect sovereignty, we don't care" |

**NTL American average (~6.5/10) measurably better than OTL 1939 USA and far better than Europe.**

### Legal vs. Social Discrimination (America)

**NO official quotas/restrictions:**
- Post-Cuba Mirror courts strike down any government-mandated discrimination
- Constitutional barrier: First Amendment + court sensitivity → any official anti-Semitism fails legally
- **Key distinction:** Government cannot officially mark people as lesser

**Social discrimination exists but is not legally enforceable:**
- Private clubs ("gentleman's agreements")
- Legacy preferences at some institutions
- Social exclusions, housing covenants (eroding)
- **But:** Full legal rights, no pogroms, no state persecution

## European Spectrum (1939)

| Nation | Tolerance Rating | Character |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Kaiserreich Germany** | 2/10 | Institutional discrimination (not genocide) |
| **Stalin's USSR** | 1/10 | Active persecution disguised as anti-Trotskyist |
| **Poland** | 3/10 | Traditional pogroms |
| **France** | 4/10 | Dreyfus legacy, social exclusion |
| **Britain** | 5/10 | Mild social discrimination |

### Why Europe Is Worse (NTL)

**Without Holocaust Shock:**
- 500 years of baseline anti-Semitism continues unbroken
- No postwar reckoning
- No Nuremberg
- No "never again"
- Just business as usual

**Kaiserreich Germany:**
- Traditional aristocratic anti-Semitism
- Exclusion from officer corps, civil service
- Social and economic restrictions
- **NOT industrial genocide** - but persistent institutional oppression

**Stalin's USSR:**
- Anti-Semitic purges disguised as anti-Trotskyist/anti-Zionist campaigns
- "Rootless cosmopolitans" persecution
- Ongoing pogroms not stopped by state
- Jews as convenient scapegoat for regime failures

**Key Difference from OTL:**
- No postwar reckoning forces confrontation with anti-Semitism
- No Nuremberg creates legal/moral framework against genocide
- No "never again" becomes cultural touchstone
- European anti-Semitism remains "normal" state policy

## Jewish Refugee Question (1930s)

### Do European Jews Flee to America? Which Nation?

**California (Most Welcoming):**
- Pragmatic meritocracy: Will take skilled refugees
- "Can you contribute to economy?" - yes → welcome
- Pacific-facing, cosmopolitan, no cultural baggage
- **Most attractive but most expensive** (high cost of living)

**Texas (Pragmatic, Growing):**
- Oil boom needs skilled labor
- Less cultural focus on Jews (not traditional scapegoat)
- Cheaper than California
- **Good option for working-class refugees**

**USA (Middle Ground):**
- Restrictive immigration laws exist (like OTL)
- But no Southern bloc to completely block
- Some refugees get through (skilled professionals, quota system)
- **Moderate welcome, moderate cost**

**CSA (Least Welcoming):**
- Least focused on Jews (preoccupied with racial dynamics)
- Poorest economy (least attractive)
- Urban areas (New Orleans, Atlanta) somewhat welcoming
- **Last choice for most refugees**

### Likely Pattern

- Skilled professionals → California (if they can afford it)
- Middle-class → USA or Texas
- Working-class → Texas (oil jobs)
- Very few → CSA (economic + social factors)

**Result:** American Jewish population grows, but not OTL scale (Palestine still receives some, just less pressure without Holocaust)

**Plausibility:** 82-87%

## American Fade Mechanism

**Timeline of Decline:**

| Decade | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **1939** | Social discrimination real but declining |
| **1960s** | Largely gone in California, fading in USA/CSA cities |
| **1990s** | Historical curiosity ("Grandpa didn't like Jews, weird") |
| **2025** | "Wait, people actually cared about that?" |

**Mechanism:**
- Economic integration (Jews succeed in business/professions)
- → Intermarriage (social barriers break down)
- → Pragmatic burnout (prejudice becomes inconvenient)
- → Indifference (nobody cares anymore)

**NOT through:**
- Activism
- Moral crusades
- Government mandates
- Social engineering

**The fade is natural attrition, not forced conversion.**

## Thematic Significance

### "Everyone Is Wrong" Maintained

- **NTL is better on some things:** Earlier civil rights, less American anti-Semitism, faster fade
- **NTL is worse on some things:** European anti-Semitism continues unbroken, no Holocaust reckoning
- **NTL is different on everything:** Mechanisms matter more than outcomes

### No Utopia, No Dystopia

- America integrates faster but through greed, not virtue
- Europe continues persecuting but without industrial genocide
- **Just different trade-offs**
