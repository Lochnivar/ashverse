# The Second Middle Passage: Final Numbers (1867-1894)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

565,000 souls  
is the exact price the Confederacy pays  
for Robert Toombs's victory speech.

It is the number that finally makes the world say  
"enough"  
and turns 1894–1905 into the coffin-nail years.

## The Numbers

| Period | Annual Average Import | Total Imported (Rounded) | Source / Realism Anchor |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **1867–1874 ("Toombs Boom")** | 35,000–45,000 per year | 320,000 | Peak years – full boycott hasn't bitten yet, planters panic-buying to rebuild war losses |
| **1875–1884 (boycott tightening)** | 15,000–20,000 per year | 170,000 | Prices crash, insurance impossible, but smuggling routes still work |
| **1885–1894 (death spiral)** | 4,000–8,000 per year | 60,000 | Only the most desperate planters; most ships seized or sunk by British patrols |
| **Total 1867–1894** | — | **550,000 – 580,000** | Conservative, locked estimate |

## Locked Total

**≈ 565,000 new Africans forcibly imported into the CSA during the Second Middle Passage.**

## Historical Context

That's:

- **Roughly equal to** the entire illegal U.S. slave trade 1808–1860
- **About 60% of** the legal trans-Atlantic trade to British North America 1619–1808
- **Enough to keep the institution breathing** for one more generation
- **But not enough to save it** from the raids + boycott + runaway haemorrhage

## The Breakdown by Period

- **Annual average:** 35,000–45,000 per year
