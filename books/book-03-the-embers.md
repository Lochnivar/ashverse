## Book Blurb
The fire has burned, and now the embers glow. Decades of raids, boycotts, and realpolitik have reshaped the continent. In 1905, slavery is finally abolished in the Confederacy—twenty years after it died in practice. The legal structure finally catches up to economic and social reality.

But the embers still glow. The continent has settled into patterns, but they are patterns of uneasy coexistence. The Fairfax and Meade bloodlines have watched it all unfold, their immortality giving them perspective on the slow arc of history. They see the patterns repeating, the same mistakes being made in new forms.

As the 1920s progress, new tensions emerge. The old conflicts may be settled, but new ones are forming. The embers can still catch fire again.

## Core Plot
The early 20th century sees the final legal end of slavery in 1905, but this is just one thread in a complex tapestry. The continent has developed new patterns of interaction: trade relationships, border agreements, cultural exchanges, and ongoing tensions. The Native super-states are established powers. California is a thriving independent republic. The Confederacy has survived but transformed.

The narrative explores how the continent functions in this new normal, while also showing the ways in which old problems persist in new forms. The immortal bloodlines provide long-term perspective, seeing patterns that others miss. New challenges emerge: industrialization, changing demographics, new technologies, and the shadow of what's happening in Europe.
