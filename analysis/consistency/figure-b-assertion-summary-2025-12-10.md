## PLausibility Assessment

**Figure B (~45,600) Plausibility: 88%** ✅

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Aligns with OTL Fredericksburg precedent (~12,500/day for single-day assault)
2. ✅ Matches described tactical intensity (repeated frontal assaults)
3. ✅ Supports narrative requirements (political fallout, morale collapse)
4. ✅ Detailed breakdown supports higher figure
5. ✅ Loss rates (43-48%) plausible for multi-day frontal assaults

**Historical Comparison:**
- OTL Fredericksburg: ~12,500 casualties in ONE DAY
- NTL Rappahannock Phase: ~20,600 casualties in THREE DAYS (~6,867/day)
- **Assessment:** Less intense than single-day Fredericksburg, but still heavy ✅
