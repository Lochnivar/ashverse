# Currencies in the NTL (1865-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

What currencies do the three republics use?

## The Three Currencies

| Republic | Currency (Official Name) | Backing (1865–1933) | Backing (1933–1939) | Nickname in 2025 |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **United States (East)** | United States dollar (USD) | Gold (100% until 1933) | Gold + silver (bimetallic after 1933 crash) | "Greenback" |
| **Confederate States** | Confederate dollar (CSD) | Gold + silver (bimetallic from day one) | Same, but heavier silver content | "Grayback" |
| **Republic of California** | California dollar (CAD) | Pure gold (never leaves the gold standard) | Pure gold (never abandons it) | "Golden Bear" |

## Key Locked Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **No shared currency** | Treaty of Sacramento (1873) explicitly forbids it. |
| **All convertible at par** | 1 USD = 1 CSD = 1 CAD for international settlements (fixed by treaty 1873, renewed every 20 years). |
| **Gold standard until 1933** | All three stay on gold through the 1929 crash (California never leaves it). |
| **1933–1939** | U.S. goes off gold (New Deal analogue). CSA follows partially. California stays on gold and becomes the continent's hard-money haven. |

## 2025 Street Reality (Post-1939 Guidance, Out of Canon)

Everyday people use whatever bill is in their pocket – Greenback, Grayback, or Golden Bear.

California dollar is the reserve currency everyone hoards "for a rainy day."

Kids learn to count in three currencies before they're ten.
