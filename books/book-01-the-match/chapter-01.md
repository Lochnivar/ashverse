July 1, 1863 - Lee's death in his tent on Seminary Ridge

--- Foreword ---

“The War Between the States has been called many things…
but it was never civil.
It was the most un-civil war in the history of the world.”
—Paul Harvey, 1965
Foreword by Author:

The un-Civil War, as Mr. Harvey so eloquently phrased it, was a war that not only didn’t need to happen, but never should have happened.  Decades of pride, both Northern and Southern, greed, base cruelty and cynical, pragmatic realpolitik ignored numerous turn-offs.  Any of these could have derailed the lumbering juggernaut.  Instead, it made the deaths of over 660,000 Americans a foregone conclusion.  War was inevitable as taxes and twice as deadly.

In an effort to be honest with the reader, I will fully acknowledge a bias in favor of the South.  I grew up in Oklahoma and Texas and my thoughts mirror those patterns.  I assure you that I am fully aware of that bias and am making every effort to be fair about the way I approach this story.  I’m drawing on actual accounts, read as unbiasedly as I can.  But I am still human, so please forgive any lurches one way or the other.

Yes, this is an alternate timeline that envisions the South winning the Civil War, but don’t throw the book out yet.  It’s not the “Lost Cause Porn” that so many South-victory-centric stories become.  It is a story that envisions one changed event in history and seeks to brutally analyze the outcomes that follow.

In closing, I want to make this brutally and honestly clear as I can.  Slavery was a disgusting “peculiar institution”.  It’s a disgrace that such an inhuman blot on the soul should have ever stained the soul of the South.  This book doesn’t seek to justify or excuse it.  Nor does it seek to revel in some “Lost Cause” idealistic fantasy.  It doesn’t accept the modern Northern victory sainthood narrative but doesn’t try to demonize the North.

Archimedes is quoted as once saying, "Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I can move the world".  In 1860, the fulcrum of slavery gave purchase that cracked the foundations of "State's Rights".  If any lesson should be learned from this narrative, it’s that you can push a group of people only so far before something snaps and the institution collapses.  For this story, the weight that "moved", collapsed really, the Union was slavery.  Today, the weight that could collapse the next Union could be any number of issues that divide us.  It simply depends on where you place the fulcrum.

So, yes, the South may win its victory, its independence.  And it may keep its “peculiar institution”, but that doesn’t mean it settled the morality of the ownership of slaves.  Even that victory has consequences that the South will find it can’t quite stomach in the fullness of time or in the hearts of men.

July 1st, 1863
After Dark
Seminary Ridge
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

John Walter Fairfax shifted his weight from one foot to the other, trying to relieve the numbness in his buttocks from hours spent in the saddle.  Even after years of growing up in the saddle (Fairfax men learned to ride young), General Longstreet set a pace that could tax any man.  

“Old Pete must be made of old leather and iron,” he mumbled to himself.

“What was that, Major?”  Longstreet looked over his shoulder, his voice slow and steady, almost monotonous.

“Nothing sir,” John Walter said quickly.  “A warm night, that’s all.”

Longstreet glanced at the sky and nodded.  

The sound of hoof beats echoed in the night, and an older man, tired and worn, appeared in the light of a campfire.  John Walter noted he kept clenching and relaxing his fist, the one that wasn’t gripping the reins.

“General Lee, I must protest this course of action.  I feel it to be unwise.”  Longstreet stepped forward.  John Walter moved with him and held his hand out for Lee to toss down Traveller’s reins.

General Robert E. Lee, Commanding Officer of the Army of Northern Virginia, paused in the act of stepping from Traveller’s saddle.  His right foot was comically in the air, still in the stirrup, and his hand still on the pommel. Traveller shivered nervously under his hand, as aware of the late hour as Lee himself.

“Easy boy,” John Walter heard Lee mumble to Traveller.  “Neither of us is as young as we were, are we?”

“I grow quite weary of this discussion, General Longstreet.”  There was an exasperation in his voice that Lee couldn’t quite filter out.  “Are my orders, somehow unclear?”

"No sir." Longstreet moved closer as Lee finished dismounting. "But sir, the prisoners we took today—all of them, from multiple units—they're consistent. Their commanding general has been replaced. They don't know who yet, but they know it's not Hooker anymore."

John Walter held the reins steady and grabbed the bridle.  Traveller seemed more restless than usual.

Lee paused, considering. "Reynolds was on the field today. Probably him. Or Meade if they want someone cautious. Warren if Lincoln's feeling desperate and wants aggression." He waved his hand. "Hooker, Meade, Reynolds, Warren—it doesn't matter, James. Whoever Lincoln puts in command, they still have to hold that ground or abandon it."

"Sir, if it's Meade, he won't make the mistakes Hooker—"

"Then we won't rely on him making mistakes." Lee's voice was firm. "We'll make our own opportunities. The enemy is there. We attack tomorrow." 

"We are here to be a thorn in their side."

“I’m quite aware of that, General.  And here we are.  From all the reports that we’ve received, all major Union forces are either camped here or moving here.  I wish Stuart were here, I’d feel less blind, but even a blind man can clearly see that we’ve kicked over the hornet’s nest.”

“Yes sir, and if Meade, or Warren, or whoever they replace Hooker with, manages to destroy our forces?”  Longstreet seemed to be fighting his own exhaustion.  That was as close to insubordination that John Walter had heard from his general.  Typically, the man was courtesy itself, especially to the man he almost idolized.

“If he manages to destroy the army, we will stop being a thorn.  Our best option is to break contact and find ground south of here to defend, and force them to our plans.  We make them rethink thier entire deployment here.  He must attack us and that favors us”

“They are hardly going to destroy our forces.  Hooker failed to do so in Chancellorsville, and whoever Lincoln picked will fail here as well.  Our boys haven’t let us down before, and no good Virginian would dare let a Union army hold such good ground.”

Lee placed his hand on the taller man’s shoulders, as if to make Longstreet feel the strength of Lee’s convictions.  He gave that shoulder a small shake to emphasize his words.

“The Union army is here, James.  If we can push around the right and roll him up those two hills south of the town, he has nothing to stop us short of Washington.  We go from being a thorn in their side to a sword in their heart.  I can feel it.”

Longstreet's face screwed up, still polite, but John Walter had been with Longstreet for years, he could read his commanding officer as easily as a preacher read the Bible.  This promised to be a long night and the Lord only knew--

John Walter's thoughts slammed shut as Lee's face drained of all color.  The hand that had been gripping Old Pete's shoulder flew his chest and grasped at the fabric of the uniform with desperate strength.  A loud rasp of pain and the general's eyes rolled in his head and the hand dropped limply to his side.  Even as Lee collapsed to the dirt, Longstreet was shouting for medics, but John Walter could see it would be in vain.  

Robert E. Lee was dead.

And the army—and every man in it—now belonged to the man still kneeling in the dirt, clutching a corpse and staring at the stars like they might give him an answer.  John Walter hoped the stars answered.
