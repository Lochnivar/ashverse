## 📋 NOTES ON POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES

### 1. "10-Week Raid" Reference
**Location:** `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` line 118  
**Text:** "July-Oct 1863: Longstreet's 10-week raid through Pennsylvania-Maryland (~55k men)"  
**Note:** This appears to refer to a **different, longer campaign** after the POD campaign (July 1 - August 6). This is likely correct as a separate extended raid phase, but should be verified as distinct from the POD campaign itself.

### 2. Meade Relief/Warren Appointment Dates
**Location:** `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` lines 119-120  
**Text:** "Aug 1, 1863: Meade sacked" / "Aug 3, 1863: Warren appointed"  
**Note:** These specific dates are consistent with "immediately after Longstreet returns across to Virginia" (August 6). The transition outline uses "early August 1863" which is consistent with these specific dates.
