# Master Timeline: The Complete Series

## The Match (1863 – March 1865) – Fully Detailed, No Wiggle Room

| Date | Event | Key consequence |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 Jul 1863 | Battle of Gettysburg Day 1 – Lee collapses, Longstreet assumes command, orders withdrawal at dawn 2 July | War turns from decision to survival |
| 2–15 Jul 1863 | ANV withdraws northwest, occupies Harrisburg corridor | Pennsylvania raid begins |
| Jul–Sep 1863 | Longstreet raids Pennsylvania (shortened 10–12 weeks), Meade shadows and bleeds him | ANV survives but is badly hurt |

| Jan 1864 | Hancock takes command of AoP | Fresh hope |
| Jun 1864 | Pickett's Raid (18 k, 21 days) – Chesapeake terror, threatens Washington, withdraws | Northern will collapses |
| Jul 1864 | Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead) | Symbol of lost hope |
| Mar 1865 | Treaty of Cincinnati – CSA independence, Native super-states recognised, armistice | War ends in negotiated partition |

## The Fire (1865 – 1894) – Broad Strokes, Flexible Detail

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1865–1867 | Last Hurrah raids (big Northern-led cells) → joint crackdown 1867–69 |
| 1867–1868 | Toombs elected → re-opens African slave trade → global boycott restarts |
| 1869–1894 | Raids go local + boycott + cotton glut → slavery becomes unprofitable |
| 1894 | Last state bans new slave imports/births → "The Last Chain Falls" (de-facto end) |
| 1894–1905 | "Zombie decade" – slavery legally lingers on paper |
| 1905 | Final constitutional convention strikes all slavery clauses → full legal abolition |

## The Embers (1894 – 1919) – Medium Detail

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1898 | Cuban crisis → CSA sees mirror of own past → accelerates final abolition push |
| 1905–1914 | Trade normalisation with Europe, "American Concord" triad begins (U.S., CSA, California) |
| 1914–1919 | European War (WWI analogue) – starts on schedule, lasts longer, ends in exhaustion stalemate |
| 1917 | Zimmerman Telegram analogue → forces U.S., CSA, California into same war (first real cooperation) |

## The Ashes (1919 – 1939) – Broad Strokes, Ends Exactly Where You Want

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1920s | California drifts → peaceful secession ~1930–32 |
| 1930s | Pacific tension rises (Japan, enabled by California oil) |
| 1 Sep 1939 | Germany invades Poland (or NTL equivalent trigger) → newspapers scream again |
| Sep 1939 | Final scene: a Fairfax and a Meade on opposite sides of the continent read the same headline |

## Why 1939 Is the Perfect Cut-Off

### Moral & Thematic Symmetry
You began with the fire (1863). You end with the continent watching **the world** catch fire (1939). The reader closes the book knowing the ashes of 1861 were only the prologue.

### Narrative Closure Without Resolution
Slavery is legally dead (1905), raids are local embers, the super-states are sovereign, California is independent, the triad is real but fragile. Nothing is "fixed." Everything is **poised**. The reader feels the next war coming the way you feel thunder in your bones.

### Historical Honesty
1939 is the last year the NTL can still feel like "our" history with different paint. After 1939 every butterfly is a hurricane. Stopping here keeps the alt-history **believable** instead of turning into 21st-century fan-fiction.

## The Final Image of The Ashes (1939)

A Fairfax (now in his 70s, living on the Sequoyah lease-land that is no longer his) and a Meade (U.S. Navy captain, East Coast) stand on opposite sides of the continent reading the same newspaper headline:

**"GERMANY INVADES POLAND"**

They each think the same thought, in different accents:

**"We thought our war was the big one."**

Fade to black.

1863–1939.  
Four books.  
One continent.  
From the match that lit America to the ashes that are about to consume the world.

No epilogue needed.

The reader knows what comes next and knows the continent will never be ready.

That's not an ending.

That's a **warning**.
