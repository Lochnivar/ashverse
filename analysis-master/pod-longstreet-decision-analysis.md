## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- 5-hour vigil - **Justification:** Plausible given circumstances, Longstreet's methodical nature
- Exact timing (04:12) - **Justification:** Narrative convenience, dawn timing is realistic
- Decision to withdraw north (not west) - **Justification:** Strategically sound, opens Pennsylvania campaign

**Limitations:**
- Requires accepting Longstreet's decision-making process - **Justification:** Aligns with documented character
- Assumes Longstreet assumes command immediately - **Justification:** He was second-in-command, natural transition

**Edge Cases:**
- What if Longstreet attacks instead? → Not tested (assumes withdrawal decision)
- What if Longstreet retreats to Virginia? → Not tested (assumes northward withdrawal)

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 92%** (Excellent)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Longstreet's character and preferences well-documented. Decision aligns perfectly with his OTL behavior. Withdrawal order militarily sound. Minor assumption: 5-hour vigil (plausible given circumstances).
