## EPIGRAPHS FROM COMPENDIUM OUTLINES

### Book I: The Match (1863-1865)

#### Part 4: The Command Crisis
> "Command is lonely. Command under political pressure while losing is lonelier. Command while being second-guessed by everyone who never commanded anything is loneliest of all."  
> — MJFL, *Memoirs of a Skeptical Soldier* (1982)

#### Part 6: Pickett's Lightning Raid
> "The purpose of cavalry is not to win battles. The purpose of cavalry is to terrify civilians, destroy infrastructure, and make the enemy's newspapers scream. In this, Pickett's Flying Corps achieved perfection."  
> — MJFL, *The Mobile Warfare Revolution* (1978)

#### Part 7: The Northern Collapse
> "Defeat is an orphan, but collapse has a thousand fathers. They all know it was someone else's fault."  
> — MJFL, *Political Warfare: When Armies Break Without Breaking* (1980)

#### Part 9: The Treaty of Cincinnati
> "Peace treaties are negotiated by pragmatists and hated by idealists. History remembers the idealists better but the pragmatists actually end the wars."  
> — MJFL, *The Art of Losing Wars Gracefully* (1979)

#### Part 10: Epilogue - The Ashes of the Match
> "They thought Gettysburg was the end. It was only the beginning of the end. The match struck in 1861 would burn for eighty years before consuming everything we thought we knew about America."  
> — MJFL, *Fire and Sovereignty* (1985)

---

### Book II: The Fire (1865-1894)

#### Part 11: The Peacemakers
> "Peace treaties are signed by pragmatists and hated by purists. History forgets the pragmatists' names but remembers the wars they ended. This seems backwards."  
> — MJFL, *The Ungrateful Art of Ending Wars* (1977)

#### Part 12: The Moderate Alliance
> "Moderates inherit peace treaties the way undertakers inherit corpses. Everyone blames them for the smell."  
> — MJFL, *Post-War Politics* (1979)

#### Part 13: The Caretakers
> "Some presidents are transformational. Some are transactional. Some just try not to break anything before handing it off to the next poor bastard. History needs all three."  
> — MJFL, *Presidential Transitions* (1981)

#### Part 14: The Toombs Act Disaster
> "There are bad ideas, terrible ideas, and then there are ideas so monumentally stupid that future historians create entire academic careers explaining how anyone could have thought them good. The Toombs Act sits comfortably in the third category."  
> — MJFL, *Economic Suicide: A Comprehensive Study* (1976)

#### Part 15: The Handoff Era
> "Inheriting another man's disaster is the political equivalent of being handed a live grenade with the pin already pulled. Your only choice is where to throw it before it explodes."  
> — MJFL, *The Ungrateful Art of Presidential Succession* (1978)

#### Part 16: The Industrial Push
> "Railroads don't care about your politics. They go where the money is. Unfortunately for the Confederacy, the money was increasingly somewhere else."  
> — MJFL, *Rails, Politics, and Economic Reality* (1980)

#### Part 17: The Gentleman's Agreement
> "A gentleman's agreement is what politicians call it when they promise not to screw each other over too badly this fiscal year. The 'gentleman' part is doing a lot of work in that phrase."  
> — MJFL, *Diplomatic Euphemisms Decoded* (1982)

#### Part 18: The Zombie Decade
> "Slavery died in 1894. It took another eleven years for the corpse to be buried. Zombies are like that—technically dead but still stumbling around causing problems."  
> — MJFL, *The Last Chain Falls* (1985)

#### Part 19: Abolition Approaches
> "By 1905, abolishing slavery was like declaring war on a corpse. Technically possible, symbolically important, strategically pointless. The war had been won by accountants, not activists."  
> — MJFL, *The Unglamorous Death of Evil* (1983)

## FOOTNOTES AND COMMENTARY

### Preface: On General Early's Delusion (1985)

The present writer begs the reader's indulgence for this single, flagrant breach of the narrative veil. General Early's assertion, delivered in a timeline mercifully denied to us, represents the apotheosis of a delusion so pure, so perfectly crystallised, that to let it pass unanswered would be an act of scholarly cowardice.

General Early's "original plan" appears to have required, in practice:

• the absence of the forty thousand Federal troops then garrisoning Washington  
• the spontaneous combustion of Fort Stevens and the entire ring of Washington defenses  
• the voluntary abdication of common arithmetic  
• and, one presumes, the cooperation of the Almighty in suspending the laws of time, space, and logistics for the duration of the afternoon

One is almost tempted to admire the audacity.  
"Delusion" comes rather closer.

The war did, in fact, end in 1865.  
The terms were dictated in Cincinnati, not Washington.  
And the only government in Christendom that recognized the Confederacy was the one that signed the treaty because it had finally run out of men willing to die trying to prove General Early wrong.

Having discharged this solitary obligation to an alternate past, the present writer shall trouble the veil no further.

And still not apologising.

### On Grant's "Blatantly Illegal Orders" (1985 Compendium, Page 487)

It has been fashionable among certain Northern historians to describe Lieutenant General Grant's march of March 1865 as 'rogue', 'extra-constitutional', or even 'an act of treason'.

One is compelled to observe that the phrase 'blatantly illegal orders' possesses a certain ring of oxymoron when issued by a man who, whatever the paperwork in Washington may have claimed, remained the only Union officer in the field still capable of giving orders that sixty-five thousand armed men considered worth obeying.

We are continually instructed that it is every officer's sacred duty to disobey illegal orders.

Quite so.

Yet in the spring of 1865 the officers of the United States Army discovered, to their evident relief, that the only order they felt morally obliged to obey was the one that came from the general who still possessed an army.

Legality, like virginity, is a condition more often asserted than demonstrated.

In the spring of 1865 the United States government discovered, to its considerable embarrassment, that it had mislaid both.

Grant did not seize power.

Power, finding itself orphaned, simply followed the only parent still willing to claim it.

One suspects the Confederate reception committee at Appomattox Court House was considerably less troubled by the constitutional niceties than were the gentlemen in Washington who had spent the previous year declaring Grant relieved of command while carefully neglecting to relieve him of his army.

History, as usual, is unkind to those who mistake parchment for power.

### On the "Mature Consideration" Farce (1985)

President Lincoln's letter of 1 January 1864 relieving General Warren is a masterpiece of bureaucratic procrastination. One is almost tempted to admire the artistry with which nine weeks of political necessity were disguised as solemn deliberation. Almost.

### On Slavery and the Fairfax Family (Chapter 9 Commentary, 1985)

Academic honesty compels acknowledgment: the Fairfaxs were slave owners. I neither apologize for nor condemn my forefathers. They were men of their time, and their accounting with the Almighty remains their business, not mine.

I note only that Granny Sam—my great-grandmother Samantha—possessed a singular gift for abolitionism that required neither pamphlet nor pulpit. A single level stare from that formidable woman could make a man question why he would condemn a fellow human to inhumanity, and dare him to be better. She accomplished more with silence than the Boston committees managed with volumes.

My disdain for the Northern abolitionist derives not from disagreement on slavery's evil—there they would find me, to their shock, an ally—but from their underbred, sanctimonious braying while simultaneously herding native peoples with a brutality that would embarrass Genghis Khan.

Trail of Tears, indeed. Hypocrisy I can forgive. Hypocrisy delivered with self-congratulation I cannot.

M.J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Sequoyah, 1985

## PREFACE STATEMENTS (From Outline)

### Opening Statement
"This volume represents twenty-three years of research into the economic, social, and diplomatic factors that led to the collapse of chattel slavery in the Confederate States between 1865 and 1894."

### Core Message
"The reader is advised that this is not a moral history. It is an economic history. Those seeking assurances that virtue triumphed over vice, that conscience prevailed over commerce, or that the arc of history bends inevitably toward justice are directed to the theology section of their local library.

This volume concerns itself with the considerably messier question of what actually happened, and why."

### Methodology
"The present writer has endeavored to be fair, thorough, and accurate. He has not endeavored to be comforting."
