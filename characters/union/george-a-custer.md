- Known for pranks and rule-breaking at academy
- Commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in 2nd U.S. Cavalry
- Served in Peninsula Campaign (1862)

### Civil War (OTL)
- Early service: Peninsula Campaign, Antietam, Fredericksburg

- Promoted to Brigadier General at age 23 (youngest general in Union army)
- Yellow Tavern (1864): Killed J.E.B. Stuart
- Overland Campaign: Aggressive cavalry raids
- Appomattox: Present at surrender
- Post-war: Indian Wars, Little Bighorn (1876) - killed with entire command

### NTL Divergence
- **Gettysburg:** July 1-2, 1863: Present but different circumstances (battle only one day)
- **Pennsylvania Campaign - York Dash (July 17, 1863):** Forward cavalry screen at York. Bold dash across Columbia/Wrightsville ford — succeeds in forcing crossing, evades Hampton/Fitz Lee skirmishers, raids Longstreet's rear wagons, gathers intel. Partial success — inflicts minor damage (~200-400 Confederate casualties), but at cost (~300-500 Union losses). Withdraws after sharp skirmish. **Saber Shattered:** Rifle round shatters saber blade mid-charge — personal close call, brief reflection on mortality. Keeps hilt as token. Press darling ("Custer's Wolverines Raid Rebel Rear!") — rare Union tactical bright spot.
- **Warren Era - Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign (August-September 1863):** Serves under Warren during campaign — aggressive cavalry actions, but less decisive than OTL
- **Rapidan Rout Horrors (September 13-15, 1863):** As diversion scouts commander (Michigan Brigade), leads aggressive probes at Raccoon Ford during Phase 4. Witnesses botched assault: men drowning in mud, wounded abandoned, brigade shattered. Shocks him — sees war's human cost beyond personal glory.
- **Pickett's Lightning Raid (June-July 1864):** Promoted to division command after York success. Leads counter-cavalry charge against Pickett's raiders — bold but reckless. **Major Wound:** Minie ball shatters shoulder/thigh during failed charge; brigade cut to pieces by Hampton. Realization of responsibility for losses. Hospital recovery — haunted by guilt, but climbs back on horse post-recovery, wiser (balances boldness with caution).
- **Grant's Final Gamble:** February 18-20, 1865: Commands cavalry brigade in desperate assault
- **The Reckless Charge:** Makes glory-hunting charge against Longstreet's lines, gets cut to pieces by Hampton's superior cavalry
- **Survives War:** Unlike OTL Little Bighorn, survives but reputation damaged by reckless failures
- **Post-War:** Survives Appomattox; haunted by losses, contributes to Appomattox mythos as wiser veteran (1909+). As instructor/figurehead at joint USA-CSA academy: Teaches cavalry tactics, emphasizes responsibility — "Charge when you must, but know the cost. I learned too late." Saber hilt/letter opener on desk — symbol of growth from reckless youth to reflective veteran.

### Starting Point (1861-1863)
- Young, ambitious cavalry officer
- Desperate for glory and recognition

- During successful dash across Columbia/Wrightsville, rifle round shatters saber mid-charge
- Personal shock: "That ball was meant for my heart."

- Partial success justifies promotion, sets up later overreach

### Gettysburg (July 1-2, 1863)

## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not Just Reckless** - Has tactical skill, not just blind aggression
- **Not a Villain** - Serves cause, believes in what he does
- **Not Perfect** - Has flaws, makes mistakes, pays the price
- **Not Just Vain** - Cares about men, not just reputation

### Key Contradictions
- **Reckless but Skilled** - Takes risks but has real ability
- **Ambitious but Loyal** - Wants glory but serves cause
- **Charismatic but Dangerous** - Inspires men but leads them to disaster
- **Survives but Fails** - Lives but reputation destroyed

### Writing Tips
- Show his charisma through interactions with men
- Contrast his flamboyance with more practical commanders
- Use his appearance (golden curls, buckskin) as visual signature
- Show his mounting desperation as war turns against Union
- Let his failure at Appomattox be the moment of realization
- Use his theatrical nature for dramatic moments

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No definitive film portrayal** - Custer has been portrayed many times, but usually focused on Little Bighorn, not Civil War

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Custer | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Tom Cruise** | 1986-2006 (*Top Gun*, *The Last Samurai*, *Mission: Impossible*) | Cruise's combination of charisma, intensity, and reckless confidence is perfect for Custer. His ability to play men who believe they're invincible until they're not matches Custer's arc. The golden hair, the theatrical presence, the absolute certainty - it's all there. | The moment before the charge at Appomattox - Cruise's face showing absolute confidence, then the slow realization as Hampton's cavalry cuts them to pieces. |
| **Brad Pitt** | 1994-2014 (*Legends of the Fall*, *Troy*, *Inglourious Basterds*) | Pitt's golden looks, charisma, and ability to play men who are both heroic and flawed is perfect for Custer. His ability to show the moment when confidence becomes desperation matches Custer's failure. | The charge itself - Pitt's face going from triumph to horror as he realizes they're surrounded and cut off. |
| **Ryan Gosling** | 2010-2025 (*Drive*, *Blade Runner 2049*, *The Gray Man*) | Gosling's intensity and ability to play men driven by obsession is perfect for Custer. His quiet intensity could show the desperation behind the flamboyance. | The moment after the charge fails - Gosling's face showing the realization that his glory-hunting has cost everything. |
| **Chris Evans** | 2010-2025 (*Captain America*, *Snowpiercer*, *Knives Out*) | Evans's combination of charisma, physical presence, and ability to play men who believe in their cause is perfect for Custer. His Captain America energy could show the idealistic side, while his darker roles show the recklessness. | The final charge - Evans's face showing absolute certainty, then the slow collapse as reality hits. |
| **Timothée Chalamet** | 2017-2025 (*Call Me By Your Name*, *Dune*, *The King*) | Chalamet's youth, intensity, and ability to play ambitious men who overreach is perfect for young Custer. His ability to show the moment when confidence becomes desperation matches Custer's arc. | The moment he realizes he's failed - Chalamet's face showing the collapse of everything he believed about himself. |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, Custer's arc is defined by multiple failures and growth through tragedy - not just Little Bighorn
- **The arc:** From reckless glory-hunter to reflective survivor - inspired by Maverick-like growth (dangerous competency + confrontation with loss)
- **The tragedy:** Glory-hunting general who charges to disaster multiple times, survives but reputation destroyed; matures through failure in losing war
- **The burden:** Must live with the knowledge that his recklessness contributed to multiple disasters; haunted by losses but learns responsibility
- **The growth:** Not caricature reckless fool - competent but learns through horror/guilt; becomes wiser veteran who teaches caution
- **The irony:** Custer matures through failure in losing war - becomes symbol of "what if" Union boldness
- **Physical presence:** Flamboyant, golden-haired, theatrical - the man who wanted to be remembered, and is - for failure, but also for growth

**Status:** HISTORICAL FIGURE - ADAPTED FOR NTL  
**Plausibility:** 92% (serves throughout war) - 90-92% (York dash) - 88% (Rapidan rout, Pickett's Raid wound, Appomattox charge)  
**Source:** OTL historical record (George Armstrong Custer was real person), adapted for NTL divergence  
**Note:** In NTL, Custer's arc is defined by multiple triggers: York dash success (saber shattered), Rapidan rout horrors (sees war's cost), Pickett's Raid wound (realizes responsibility), and Appomattox charge failure. He survives but is remembered as the glory-hunting general who charged to disaster multiple times. However, he matures through failure - becomes reflective survivor who teaches caution at Appomattox academy. Arc inspired by Maverick-like growth: dangerous competency + relentless drive to "climb back on the horse," but tempered by shocks of loss/responsibility. Contrast with OTL where he's remembered for Little Bighorn (1876).
