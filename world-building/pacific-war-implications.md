# Pacific War Implications in the NTL

## OTL Chain of Events That Led to Pearl Harbor (1931–1941)

| Year | Trigger | Why it forced war with the U.S. |
|------|---------|--------------------------------|
| 1931 | Japan invades Manchuria | U.S. condemns, but no real action |
| 1937 | Full war with China | U.S. begins moral embargo, then oil/steel sanctions |
| 1940 | Japan occupies French Indochina | U.S. freezes Japanese assets, cuts 80% of oil |
| 1941 | Japan needs oil → only two choices: withdraw from China or seize Dutch East Indies | U.S. refuses to lift embargo unless Japan withdraws completely → Japan chooses war |

## NTL 1941 – Same Triggers, Different Pressures

| Trigger | NTL version | Pressure on Japan (vs. OTL) |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Manchuria 1931 | Still happens – Japan needs resources | Same |
| China War 1937 | Still happens – Japan is committed | Same |
| French Indochina 1940 | Still happens – Vichy France is weak | Same |
| Oil embargo | **This is where everything changes** | **Much weaker** |

## The Big NTL Off-Ramps (Japan never has to choose suicide)

| Off-Ramp | Why it exists in NTL | Likelihood Japan takes it |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **California as oil supplier** | Independent California is rich, neutral-ish, and has massive Bakersfield/Long Beach oil fields. It has **zero moral objection** to selling oil to Japan if the price is right. | 9/10 |
| **No ideological U.S. opposition** | The fractured U.S. is busy with its own problems. No Roosevelt, no "arsenal of democracy" rhetoric. | 8/10 |
| **British/Dutch East Indies still available but riskier** | Japan can still seize them, but now has a **safe alternative** in California oil. | 7/10 |
| **CSA as second oil source** | Confederate Texas oil is also on the table (and the CSA hates the North more than Japan). | 6/10 |

## Realistic 1931–1941 Pacific Outcome in the NTL

| Year | What Japan actually does |
|------|-------------------------|
| 1931–37 | Invades Manchuria and China exactly as OTL – no one stops them. |
| 1938–40 | Starts buying **California** oil at premium prices instead of facing total embargo. |
| 1940–41 | Occupies Indochina, but **never** gets the crippling U.S.-led oil cutoff because California keeps selling. |
| 1941 | **No Pearl Harbor**. Japan expands south (Dutch East Indies, Malaya) against weakened Britain/France, but never hits California or the fractured U.S. directly. |

## Result by 1945

- Japan dominates East Asia and most of the Western Pacific.
- California is the **Switzerland of the Pacific** – rich, neutral, selling oil and movies to everyone.
- There is a Pacific War (Japan vs. Britain/France/Commonwealth), but the U.S. and California stay out or join very late and only symbolically.

## Key Point

In the NTL, **there is no Pearl Harbor analogue in 1941**.

California's oil and the broken U.S. give Japan **multiple off-ramps** it never had OTL.

The war still happens — just not against California, and not on December 7.
