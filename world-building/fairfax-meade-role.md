# The Fairfax and Haskell Families: Their Evolving Role

## The Original Frame

The original "two families as witness" frame was perfect when the story was a tight, 76-year burn from 1863–1939.

## The Problem

Once the timeline expanded to 1939, Native super-states, California secession, Japanese Hawaii, and inter-tribal councils, the witness constraint turned from elegant to **straightjacket**.

Forcing a Fairfax or Haskell into every scene would have:
- made half the plot feel contrived ("why is a Fairfax conveniently in Hiroshima in 1945?")
- choked the scope of the world you've built
- reduced the Native super-states to side characters instead of co-protagonists
- killed the Council of the Four Roads scenes (because no Fairfax can plausibly be present for every one)

## The New Rule

The Fairfaxes and Haskells are **no longer required witnesses**.

They become:
- recurring **touchstones**
- living symbols of the choices their ancestors made
- occasional POV characters when the story naturally lands on them
- but **never** the only lens

The epic is now the **continent itself**, told through whoever is closest to the fire at any given moment.

## The Compromise

Keep the Fairfaxes and Haskells as **prominent multi-generational families** across the entire 1863–1939 epic.

Everyone else (presidents, generals, council delegates, Japanese admirals, Comanche captains, California oil barons) comes and goes. They live, they die, they're forgotten.

But **every single major turning point** still has **at least one Fairfax or one Haskell** within smelling distance (not always narrating, not always centre-stage, but **there**).

## How the Families Stay "Permanent" Without Choking the Story

| Era | How the families stay "permanent" without choking the story |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1863–1894** | Core POV characters (Thomas Fairfax, Samantha Fairfax, their children). |
| **1894–1930** | Grandchildren / great-grandchildren scattered across Sequoyah, California, the CSA, even one in Japan as a trade attaché. |
| **1930–1939** | The family trees are now **dozens** of cousins spread over five nations. One is always a diplomat, one a rancher, one a council delegate, one a California senator, one a U.S. admiral, one a Comanche wife. |

They are **not** required to narrate every scene.  
They are only required to **be alive somewhere on the continent** so that when history turns, there is always **one pair of family eyes** that saw it coming or felt it land.

The reader never forgets the fire started with two families.  
But the continent is now big enough that the fire has children of its own.

## The Legacy

Fairfaxes and Haskells:  
prominent families whose members appear across generations.  
Everyone else comes and goes, but these families provide continuity.

That's not constraint.

That's **legacy**.

Two families started the fire.

The continent decides what burns.
