# Plausibility Gate Process

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** LOCKED AS PROCESS  
**Purpose:** Formal plausibility scoring system for all world-building decisions

**The Rule:** **70% or justify.**

## THE PLAUSIBILITY SCALE

| Rating | Meaning | What you do with it |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **90–100%** | Virtually certain – strong OTL precedent or ironclad logic | **Lock it, no questions** |
| **80–89%** | Highly plausible – needs only minor favorable conditions | **Safe default canon** |
| **70–79%** | Plausible – requires a specific, defensible chain of events | **Green flag with note**: "justify in 1–2 sentences" |
| **60–69%** | Possible but unlikely – needs multiple favorable breaks | **Yellow flag**: "only if it earns its keep dramatically" |
| **<60%** | Implausible without heroic assumptions | **Red flag**: "avoid unless it's the single best story beat in the book and you're willing to defend it forever" |

## HOW TO USE THE 70% GATE

### Step 1: Quick Plausibility Score

Any new idea gets a quick **plausibility score** (you, me, or Cursor).

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this have strong OTL precedent?
- Is the chain of events defensible?
- Would real human incentives support this?
- Does this require heroic assumptions?

### Step 2: Apply the Gate

**70% or higher** → Goes straight in (maybe with a one-line justification).

**60–69%** → You have to write one paragraph explaining why it's worth the stretch. If the paragraph sings, it stays.

**Below 60%** → Automatic "author's choice" override, but you must explicitly tag it:

> "Plausibility: 55% – kept for narrative impact. Reader warned in footnote."

### Step 3: Document the Score

Every major world-building decision should include:
- **Plausibility score** (e.g., "Plausibility: 78%")
- **Brief justification** (1–2 sentences for 70–79%, paragraph for 60–69%)
- **Status** (Locked, Green flag, Yellow flag, Red flag)

## WHY 70% IS THE SWEET SPOT

- **High enough** to keep grognards from throwing the book
- **Low enough** to let you have **fun** (the Harris VP choice, the kaiju tourism board, the Scott Papers) without breaking the world
- **Forces you to earn** the stretches instead of hand-waving them

**It's the difference between a timeline that feels real and one that just is real.**

## EXAMPLES FROM CURRENT CANON

| Idea | Score | Status | Justification |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Lee dies of heart attack, night of 1 July 1863 | 94% | **Locked** | Strong OTL precedent (Lee's health, stress, age) |
| Longstreet countermarches north at dawn | 92% | **Locked** | Ironclad logic (Longstreet's known preferences, army survival) |
| Meade freezes 36 hours | 78% | **Green flag** | Exhaustion + Chancellorsville trauma + no cavalry intelligence |
| California secedes peacefully 1873 | 88% | **Locked** | Economic leverage + geographic isolation + OTL precedent |
| Pacific Alliance forms 1894–1907 | 82% | **Locked** | Natural economic/political alignment, OTL regional cooperation patterns |
| No "woke" politics by 2025 | 96% | **Locked** | Five killer blows (no single moral superpower, no redemption arc, etc.) |
| Isham G. Harris as toxic VP who kills the Democrats | 72% | **Green flag** | Hancock needed "reconciliation" figure + Democrats were desperate + "But, Tennessee?" rhetorical lock |

## PROCESS INTEGRATION

### When to Use This Gate

- **All major world-building decisions** (treaties, elections, economic systems, cultural movements)
- **Character arcs** that affect the timeline
- **Military campaigns** and strategic decisions
- **Diplomatic events** and international relations
- **Social/cultural developments** that shape the world

### When NOT to Use This Gate

- **Minor character details** (unless they affect the timeline)
- **Aesthetic choices** (unless they affect plausibility)
- **Narrative structure** (unless it affects world-building)

### Documentation Standard

Every world-building document should include plausibility scores for major decisions:

```markdown
## Decision: [Name]

**Plausibility:** 78%

**Justification:** [1-2 sentences explaining the chain of events]

**Status:** Green flag (justified)
```

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**70% or justify.**

You've already instinctively stayed above 70% on everything that matters. This process just makes it explicit and systematic.

**Locked as process.**

You'll never regret it.
