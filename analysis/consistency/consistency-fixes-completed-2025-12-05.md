## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### High Priority Files Updated
1. ✅ `series-overview.md` - Changed "Fairfax and Meade" to "Fairfax and Haskell"
2. ✅ `world-building/master-timeline.md` - Changed "a Fairfax and a Meade" to "a Fairfax and a Haskell" (2 instances)
3. ✅ `world-building/narrative-mechanisms-anti-sympathy.md` - Clarified "Fairfax/Meade" to "Fairfax" with note about Samantha Meade
4. ✅ `analysis/project-analysis-comprehensive.md` - Updated file reference and witness family mentions (3 instances)
5. ✅ `notes/questions-and-answers.md` - Updated "Fairfax/Meade" references (2 instances)

## 📊 FINAL STATUS

**Overall Consistency:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

All references to the witness families have been updated from "Meade family" to "Haskell family" where appropriate. References to "Samantha Meade" and the "Fairfax-Meade marriage" have been correctly preserved.

## 📝 REMAINING OLD FILES (For Reference Only)

These files are outdated but can be kept for historical reference:
- `characters/meade-bloodline.md` - Old Meade family file
- `characters/fairfax-meade-cast-list.md` - Old cast list
- `AI-DUMP.md` - Historical reference file

**Recommendation:** Archive or clearly mark these as outdated reference files.
