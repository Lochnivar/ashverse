## POTENTIAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. **Capital Consistency**
- **Issue:** `american-concord-treaty.md` mentions "Monterey/San Francisco" as summit host
- **Question:** Should this be just "San Francisco" now that capital is established?
- **Impact:** Minor - could be "San Francisco (or Monterey)" for variety

### 2. **Overlap Between Files**
- **Issue:** `california-diplomacy.md` and `california-older-sibling-role.md` have overlapping content
- **Question:** Should these be consolidated or kept separate?
- **Impact:** Medium - could cause confusion

### 3. **Hawaii-California Relationship**
- **Issue:** `hawaii-timeline.md` mentions California's potential role post-1945 but doesn't detail it
- **Question:** Should California's relationship with Japanese Hawaii be defined?
- **Impact:** Low - post-1939 is out of canon anyway

### 4. **Council of Four Roads Location**
- **Issue:** `california-council-arbiter.md` mentions "Monterey or San Francisco" as host city
- **Question:** Should this be just "San Francisco" or keep both options?
- **Impact:** Minor - could be either

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ LOCKED:
1. ✅ **california-diplomacy.md** - LOCKED CANON
2. ✅ **california-japan-relationship.md** - LOCKED CANON

3. ⚠️ **california-1898.md** - Specific historical event, well-defined

### Needs Minor Updates Before Locking:
1. ⚠️ **american-concord-treaty.md** - Update "Monterey/San Francisco" reference?

### Can Stay Unlocked (For Now):

## QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

1. Should "Monterey/San Francisco" references be changed to just "San Francisco" or kept as options?
2. Should `california-diplomacy.md` and `california-older-sibling-role.md` be consolidated?
3. Are there any other California-adjacent topics not covered here?
4. Should the behavior/role files be locked now or wait for further development?
