### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Lockwood | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Matthew McConaughey** | 2012-2025 (*Dallas Buyers Club*, *Interstellar*, *True Detective*) | The perfect "new money" Southern pragmatist. McConaughey's Texas drawl, calculating eyes, and ability to play both charming and ruthless make him ideal for a man who builds a fortune through efficiency and opportunity. | Gettysburg, July 2 - McConaughey checking ammunition counts while Longstreet makes his decision, muttering "We have enough for three days. After that, we're throwing rocks." The perfect blend of competence and pragmatism. |
| **Walton Goggins** | 2010-2025 (*Justified*, *The Hateful Eight*, *Vice Principals*) | Goggins's ability to play pragmatic, slightly ruthless characters with hidden depth is perfect for Lockwood. His Southern background and sharp intelligence match the character's new-money pragmatism. | Post-war Texas, 1870s - Goggins negotiating an oil deal, using the same efficiency he used managing ordnance. "War is expensive. Peace is profitable. I'll take peace." |
| **Sam Rockwell** | 2000-2025 (*Three Billboards*, *Moon*, *Jojo Rabbit*) | Rockwell's ability to play competent, slightly eccentric characters with hidden intelligence is perfect for Lockwood. His efficiency and pragmatism would shine in the ordnance officer role. | Pennsylvania raid, September 1863 - Rockwell finding supplies in Northern territory, calculating costs and benefits. "I don't care how it's always been done. I care if it works." |
| **Michael Shannon** | 2005-2025 (*Boardwalk Empire*, *Take Shelter*, *Nocturnal Animals*) | Shannon's intensity and ability to play calculating, efficient characters is perfect for Lockwood. His sharp features and focused gaze match the character's pragmatic nature. | Post-war, 1880s - Shannon building his Texas empire, using war connections and business acumen. The same efficiency that kept the army supplied now builds a fortune. |
| **Jon Hamm** | 2007-2015 (*Mad Men*, *The Town*) | Hamm's ability to play competent, calculating characters with hidden ambition is perfect for Lockwood. His business-like efficiency and sharp intelligence match the character's pragmatism. | Gettysburg, July 1 - Hamm managing ordnance during the battle, ensuring supplies are available. "The army needs supplies, not speeches. Let me do my job." |
