## SUMMARY

### Confederate Cavalry Command Transitions — INTEGRATED ✓

2. **Hampton's Death & Fitz Lee Promotion (July 18, 1863)** ✓

---

### Update 1: Stuart's Western Transfer (July 5-7, 1863)

**Locked Timeline:**
- **July 2, 1863:** Stuart sidelined for leaving army blind on July 1 (vignette locked)
- **July 3-10, 1863 (Harrisburg Occupation):** Longstreet formally "promotes" Stuart west (e.g., to Army of Tennessee or western theater command) — effective immediately
  - Rationale: Longstreet uses occupation time to reorganize cavalry under Hampton; Stuart's failure makes exile convenient
  - Stuart departs July 5-7 with small escort — gone before York
- **July 18, 1863 (York Encounter):** Hampton killed in Custer's dash — Fitz Lee assumes command (senior after Hampton)
  - Stuart already west — no recall possible

**Narrative Impact:**
- Reinforces Longstreet's decisiveness: "Better gone than a liability."
- Cavalry talent depth loss: Stuart exiled, Hampton dead — Fitz Lee competent but not elite
- No Mary Sue — decisions have costs (weaker cavalry later)

**Files Updated:**
- `archive/world-building/timelines/pod-campaign/part-02-harrisburg-occupation.md` ✓
  - Added Stuart's western transfer to July 5-7 section (cavalry reorganization)

### Update 2: Hampton's Death & Fitz Lee Promotion (July 18, 1863)

**Locked Details:**
- **July 18, 1863 (York Encounter):** Hampton personally leads Confederate cavalry response to Custer's successful dash across Columbia/Wrightsville ford
- **Hampton Killed:** In sharp cavalry clash repulsing Custer's raid — Hampton falls (e.g., shot leading charge or in melee)
  - Rationale: Hampton's aggressive style (OTL bravery) + need to contain Custer's breakthrough
  - Narrative: Hampton's death gives CSA cavalry a costly "black eye" despite repulse — balances Custer's partial success
- **Immediate Succession:** Fitzhugh Lee (senior brigade commander after Hampton) assumes overall cavalry corps command
  - Rationale: Fitz Lee is next in seniority, capable, and Longstreet trusts the Lee name
  - Longstreet: "Hampton's gone — Fitz, the cavalry is yours."

**Impact on Canon:**
- **Custer's York Dash:** Now costs Confederate cavalry its commander — Custer's "rare success" has real bite
- **CSA Cavalry Command (1863-1865):** Fitzhugh Lee leads screening, matador delay, Rapidan counters, Pickett's Raid response
- **Narrative Balance:** Removes Hampton's post-war toxicity; Fitz Lee less overtly extreme
- **No Changes** to locked timeline events, outcomes, or casualties (Hampton's death absorbed in skirmish losses)

**Files Updated:**
- `archive/world-building/timelines/pod-campaign/part-03-reading-raid-return.md` ✓
  - Updated York encounter section (July 18) with Custer's dash, Hampton's death, Fitz Lee promotion
  - Updated all Hampton references to note his death at York
  - Updated Longstreet's reflection to mention Fitz Lee instead of Hampton
  - Updated narrative impact section
- `archive/world-building/military/battle-of-york-1863-07-18.md` ✓
  - Updated commanders section to note Hampton's death and Fitz Lee promotion
  - Updated battle course to include Custer's dash and Hampton's death
  - Updated Longstreet's reflection
  - Updated narrative role section

---

**Rationale:**
- **Operational Logic:** Stuart exiled during occupation reorganization, Hampton killed in action at York — natural progression
- **Narrative Balance:** Custer's success costs Confederate cavalry its commander — no free victories
- **Character Development:** Longstreet's decisiveness (exiles Stuart), Hampton's bravery (killed leading counterattack), Fitz Lee's competence (promoted)
- **Talent Depth Loss:** Stuart exiled, Hampton dead — Fitz Lee competent but not elite — realistic cost of decisions

**Preserved Elements:**
- All campaign dates unchanged
- All casualty numbers unchanged (Hampton's death absorbed in skirmish losses)
- All battle outcomes unchanged
- All other timeline events unchanged

**Cross-References:**
- Custer's York dash now has real narrative weight (costs Confederate cavalry commander)
- CSA cavalry command chain now clear: Stuart (exiled July 5-7) → Hampton (killed July 18) → Fitz Lee (promoted July 18)
- Matador maneuver and subsequent operations now under Fitz Lee's command

---

**Status:** ✅ **UPDATES INTEGRATED**

Confederate cavalry command transitions now fully integrated. Stuart exiled during Harrisburg occupation (July 5-7), Hampton killed at York (July 18), Fitz Lee promoted to cavalry corps command. All timeline documents updated with proper cross-references.
