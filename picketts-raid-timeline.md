# Pickett's Lightning Raid: Master Timeline (January - July 1864)

**Campaign:** Pickett's Lightning Raid  
**Coverage:** January 1 - July 22, 1864  
**Context:** The raid that proved the South could strike anywhere, the North couldn't stop them, and the war was unwinnable  
**Date Created:** December 10, 2025

---

## OVERVIEW

Pickett's Lightning Raid represents the culmination of Longstreet's strategic evolution: Convert the Army of Northern Virginia from siege army to raiding force. Strike deep, move fast, destroy infrastructure, never fight battles, come home safely.

**The Strategic Vision:**
- Winter 1863-64: Rebuild after Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign
- Spring 1864: Create "The Flying Corps" - mounted infantry with cavalry mobility
- Summer 1864: Launch deep raid into Maryland/Pennsylvania
- Objective: Prove Northern vulnerability, boost peace movement, secure Confederate independence

**The Execution:**
- 14,000 men (Pickett's Division + cavalry brigades)
- 24 guns (horse artillery)
- 30 days behind enemy lines (June 14 - July 14, 1864)
- 8 days return march through Virginia (July 14-22)
- 400+ miles raided
- Zero major battles fought
- Every man brought home

**Note:** Newspapers reported "FORTY DAYS OF TERROR!" counting from first crossing reports (June 14) to confirmed return to ANV (July 22). Pickett never corrected the myth - "Forty Days" became the legendary number everyone remembers, though actual raiding was 30 days.

**The Result:**
- Baltimore & Ohio Railroad severed
- Northern Central Railroad destroyed
- Reading coal supply disrupted (again)
- Philadelphia rail connections cut
- Northern morale shattered
- Peace movement triumph
- McClellan's November 1864 victory assured

## PART 1: WINTER REBUILDING (JANUARY - MARCH 1864)

### JANUARY 1, 1864 - WARREN FORMALLY RELIEVED

**Midnight, December 31/January 1:**

**War Department Orders (Effective 00:01, January 1, 1864):**

> Major General Gouverneur K. Warren is hereby formally and permanently relieved of command of the Army of the Potomac. General Warren will report to the War Department for reassignment to administrative duties.
>
> Major General Winfield Scott Hancock is confirmed as permanent commander of the Army of the Potomac.
>
> By order of the President
> Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War

**Warren's Final Reflection (Private diary, January 1):**

> "It's official. My career as field commander is over. 90 days in command. 70,000 casualties. No victories. Complete failure by any measure.
>
> History will judge me harshly. Perhaps deservedly. I commanded, I failed, I bear responsibility.
>
> But I will always know the truth: I was ordered to attack positions that could not be taken. I obeyed orders that should not have been given. And 45,000 men paid the price.
>
> Tomorrow I report to Washington for 'administrative duties' - military purgatory. My war is over."

---

### JANUARY 3, 1864 - HANCOCK TAKES PERMANENT COMMAND

**Official Ceremony, Army of the Potomac Headquarters:**

**Hancock's Address to Army (Reading from prepared speech):**

> "Soldiers of the Army of the Potomac,
>
> I assume permanent command of this army with humility and determination. You have suffered terribly. You have been asked to do the impossible. Many of your brothers did not return from October's battles.
>
> I make you these promises:
>
> First: I will never waste your lives. If I order an attack, it will be because I believe we can win, not because Washington demands headlines.
>
> Second: I will rebuild this army. You will be trained, equipped, and led properly. When we fight, we will fight as a professional force, not a mob.
>
> Third: I will be honest with you. No false promises. No lies about easy victories. You deserve the truth.
>
> We have a long winter ahead. We will use it to become the army we should have been from the start. When spring comes, if we must fight, we will be ready.
>
> But we will fight on our terms, not theirs. And we will fight to win, not to satisfy politicians.
>
> God bless you all."

**Soldiers' Reaction (Recorded in letters):**

> "Hancock means what he says. You can tell. He's not like the others. He actually cares if we live or die. Maybe this army has a chance after all."

---

### JANUARY-MARCH 1864: UNION WINTER REBUILDING

**Hancock's Priorities:**

1. **Officer Purge:** Remove incompetent commanders
2. **Training Reform:** Professional drilling, defensive tactics
3. **Reinforcement:** Bring up fresh regiments
4. **Morale:** Restore confidence through care and honesty
5. **Discipline:** Stop desertion epidemic

---

**January-March Statistics:**

**Strength Changes:**
- January 1: ~93,680
- New regiments: +22,000 (mostly bounty men)
- Desertions: -4,200 (still high but improving)
- Disease/discharge: -2,800
- March 31: ~108,680

**Quality Assessment:**
- Veterans: ~40,000 (exhausted but loyal)
- Adequate troops: ~35,000 (garrison soldiers, recovering wounded)
- Green troops: ~33,680 (bounty men, new recruits - untested)

**Morale:** Still poor but slowly improving (Hancock effect)

---

**Training Regimen:**

**Daily Schedule (Typical regiment):**
- 06:00-08:00: Company drill
- 08:00-10:00: Defensive tactics (entrenchment, fortification)
- 10:00-12:00: Marksmanship
- 12:00-13:00: Lunch
- 13:00-15:00: Battalion maneuvers
- 15:00-17:00: Physical conditioning

**Emphasis:** Defense, not offense (learning from Longstreet)

---

### JANUARY-MARCH 1864: CONFEDERATE WINTER TRANSFORMATION

**Longstreet's Strategic Vision:**

> "The Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign proved we can defend forever. But defense doesn't win wars - it just doesn't lose them. The North is exhausted, but they won't quit unless we make them quit.
>
> We need to strike. Not at their armies - we tried that at Gettysburg, didn't work. Strike at their morale. Strike at their infrastructure. Strike at their hope.
>
> We need a raid. A DEEP raid. Into Maryland, maybe Pennsylvania. Burn railroads, destroy supplies, humiliate them. Prove they can't protect their own territory. Show the Northern people that this war will never end unless they negotiate peace.
>
> But not like Stuart's 1862-63 raids - those were cavalry showing off. We need something bigger. More destructive. More strategic.
>
> We need... a flying corps."

---

**The Flying Corps Concept:**

**Longstreet to Davis (Letter, January 15, 1864):**

> Mr. President,
>
> I propose creation of a special striking force for summer 1864 operations. I call it "The Flying Corps."
>
> **Composition:**
> - Pickett's Division (~5,500 infantry) - MOUNTED on horses
> - Fitzhugh Lee's Cavalry Brigade (~2,500 sabers)
> - Lomax's Cavalry Brigade (~2,000 sabers)
> - Horse Artillery (~24 guns, 600 men)
> - Pioneers/Engineers (~400 men, for railroad destruction)
> - **Total:** ~14,000 men, all mounted
>
> **Mission:**
> Deep raid into Maryland/Pennsylvania. Objectives:
> 1. Destroy B&O Railroad (sever Washington-Midwest connection)
> 2. Destroy Northern Central Railroad (isolate Baltimore)
> 3. Threaten Reading coal region (repeat 1863 panic)
> 4. Destroy railroads connecting Philadelphia to Washington
> 5. Return safely
>
> **Duration:** 4-6 weeks
>
> **Expected Casualties:** Minimal (no major battles, just raids)
>
> **Strategic Effect:** Massive. Prove North cannot defend own territory. Boost peace movement. Help Copperheads win November election.
>
> **Cost:** 16,000 horses (to mount infantry + reserves)
>
> We have the men (Pickett's Division never took heavy losses in 1863). We have the cavalry (Hampton, Fitz Lee, Lomax all proven). We need the horses and your permission.
>
> This raid could win the war - not militarily, but politically. And political victory is the only victory we can achieve.
>
> Your obedient servant,
> James Longstreet

---

**Davis' Response (January 20):**

> General Longstreet,
>
> Your proposal is audacious. It is also necessary.
>
> I approve formation of "The Flying Corps." You will receive:
> - 16,000 horses (requisitioned from Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia farms)
> - Priority for supplies and equipment
> - Authority to train as you see fit
>
> Conditions:
> 1. Raid must not jeopardize Army of Northern Virginia's defensive position
> 2. You must bring the men home - we cannot afford Pickett's Division lost
> 3. No pitched battles - raid and run only
> 4. Launch window: June-July 1864 (after elections decided, before harvest)
>
> If this succeeds, it may end the war. If it fails, we have lost nothing but horses.
>
> Proceed.
>
> Jefferson Davis

### FEBRUARY-MARCH 1864: FORMING THE FLYING CORPS

**The Transformation of Pickett's Division:**

**Challenge:** Turn 5,500 infantry into mounted infantry

**Process:**
1. **Horses Arrive:** 7,000 horses delivered (enough for division + remounts)
2. **Training Begins:** Infantry learn to ride, care for horses
3. **Weapons Modified:** Shorter rifles for mounted combat
4. **Tactics Developed:** Mount, ride fast, dismount to fight, remount, ride away
5. **Duration:** 8 weeks (February 1 - March 31)

---

**Pickett's Orders to Division (February 1):**

> Men,
>
> You are about to become something new in this war. Not infantry. Not cavalry. Something in between.
>
> You will ride like cavalry. You will fight like infantry. You will move faster than any force the Yankees have. And you will strike deeper than they think possible.
>
> For the next eight weeks, you will learn to ride. Some of you have never been on a horse. That's fine. You'll learn. The horses are gentle (mostly). The saddle sores will heal (eventually).
>
> This summer, we're going north. Not to fight battles - we leave that to Hancock. We're going to burn railroads, destroy supplies, and ride home before the Yankees even know we're there.
>
> Welcome to the Flying Corps.

---

**Soldiers' Reactions (Letters home, February-March):**

**Private, Garnett's Brigade:**
> "Pa, they're teaching us to ride horses. Me! On a horse! I fell off three times yesterday. The boys are laughing but we're all terrible at it. They say we're going on a raid this summer. Sounds better than charging Yankee fortifications."

**Sergeant, Kemper's Brigade:**
> "We're becoming cavalry but keeping our rifles. The idea is we ride fast, get to where Yankees aren't expecting us, dismount, fight if we have to, then ride away before reinforcements arrive. General Pickett says we'll strike deeper into Pennsylvania than anyone has. If we can pull it off, it'll be amazing. If we can't... well, at least we'll have tried something different than getting shot attacking trenches."

> - Horse Artillery Battalion (Williams)
> - Pioneer Company (Railroad destruction)
>
> This provisional corps will be known as "The Flying Corps" and will operate independently under General Pickett's command with authority to conduct operations as directed by army headquarters.
>
> By command of Lieutenant General Longstreet

---

**Pickett's Command Conference (April 2):**

**Present:**
- Major General George E. Pickett (commanding)
- Brigadier General Richard B. Garnett (infantry brigade)
- Brigadier General James L. Kemper (infantry brigade)
- Brigadier General Lewis A. Armistead (infantry brigade)
- Brigadier General Montgomery D. Corse (infantry brigade)
- Brigadier General Fitzhugh Lee (cavalry brigade)
- Brigadier General Lunsford L. Lomax (cavalry brigade)
- Colonel R. Preston Chew (horse artillery)
- Major John W. Puller (pioneers/engineers)

---

**Pickett (unveiling maps):**

> "Gentlemen, we have our orders. This summer - June or July - we ride north. Our mission: Destroy every railroad within 100 miles of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Burn every military depot we find. Create maximum chaos. Return safely.
>
> We will NOT:
> - Fight major battles (if we see Union infantry, we ride away)
> - Attack fortifications (we're raiders, not besiegers)
> - Stay in one place more than 24 hours
> - Risk the corps for any tactical objective
>
> We WILL:
> - Move fast (30-40 miles per day when necessary)
> - Strike unexpectedly (hit where they're not looking)
> - Destroy infrastructure (railroads, bridges, supplies)
> - Bring every man home
>
> Our target list:
> 1. B&O Railroad - main line (cuts Washington-Midwest connection)
> 2. Northern Central Railroad (isolates Baltimore from Harrisburg)
> 3. Reading area railroads (disrupts coal again)
> 4. Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (severs Philadelphia-Washington)
> 5. Any gunboats or supply depots we encounter
>
> Route: Cross Potomac at Edwards Ferry or Point of Rocks, ride through Maryland to Pennsylvania, destroy targets systematically, recross Potomac at Occoquan or Leesylvania.
>
> Duration: 4-6 weeks behind enemy lines.
>
> Questions?"

**Fitzhugh Lee:**
> "What if Hancock's entire army comes after us?"

**Pickett:**
> "We ride away. 14,000 mounted men can outrun 100,000 infantry. That's the whole point."

**Garnett:**
> "What about supplies? Six weeks is a long time."

**Pickett:**
> "We live off the land. Maryland and Pennsylvania are rich. We'll eat better than we do in Virginia."

**Armistead:**
> "Rules of engagement with civilians?"

**Pickett:**
> "Same as Reading 1863. No violence against civilians. We destroy military targets only. Issue receipts for food. We're soldiers, not bandits."

---

### APRIL-MAY 1864: FINAL TRAINING

**Training Focus:**

1. **Long-distance riding:** 40-mile forced marches
2. **Railroad destruction:** How to tear up tracks efficiently
3. **Bridge burning:** Techniques for destroying wooden trestles
4. **Night movement:** Operating in darkness
5. **Evasion:** Avoiding Union forces
6. **Supply discipline:** Living off the land

---

**April 15-30: Supply Stockpiling:**

**Assembled at Gordonsville:**
- 2,500 replacement horses (remounts)
- 120 tons of oats (horse feed)
- Demolition equipment (axes, sledgehammers, powder charges)
- Medical supplies (portable hospital)
- Ammunition (60 rounds per man, artillery shells)
- Maps (detailed surveys of Maryland/Pennsylvania)

---

### MAY 1864: PROOF-OF-CONCEPT RAIDS

**Longstreet's Decision:** "Test the concept before committing to major raid"

**May 5-12: Hampton's Raid (Small-Scale Test):**

**Force:** Hampton's Brigade, ~1,800 cavalry

**Objective:** Cross Potomac, raid into Maryland, return safely

**May 5:** Cross at Point of Rocks
**May 6-8:** Burn supply depot at Poolesville, tear up B&O tracks at Monocacy Junction
**May 9-11:** Evade Union cavalry (Buford's division sent in pursuit)
**May 12:** Recross Potomac at Edwards Ferry

**Result:** 
- Complete success
- Zero casualties (no major combat)
- Union garrisons panicked
- Proof that deep raids are feasible

---

**May 15-22: Fitzhugh Lee's Raid (Larger Test):**

**Force:** Fitzhugh Lee's Brigade, ~2,500 cavalry + 8 guns

**Objective:** Deeper penetration, more destruction

**May 15:** Cross at Edwards Ferry
**May 16-18:** Raid into Montgomery County, Maryland, burn Frederick supply depot
**May 19-20:** Threaten Baltimore approaches (panic in city)
**May 21:** Union forces (two brigades, ~4,000 men) attempt interception
**May 22:** Fitzhugh Lee evades, recrosses Potomac at Seneca

**Result:**
- Success
- Light casualties (~80 men, mostly from skirmishes)
- Baltimore panicked
- Proof that even large forces can raid successfully

---

**Longstreet's Assessment (May 25):**

> "The small raids worked. Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee proved the concept. Now we go big. Pickett's entire corps. Six weeks. Maximum destruction.
>
> Hancock still thinks we're preparing to attack his fortifications. He has no idea we're about to ride around him entirely.
>
> This is going to work."

---

**Washington's Reaction to May Raids:**

**Lincoln to Stanton (May 23):**
> "Twice in three weeks, Confederate cavalry has raided into Maryland with impunity. Our garrisons can't stop them. Our cavalry can't catch them. What happens if they send a larger force?"

**Stanton:**
> "Hancock assures me his cavalry screens can intercept any major raid."

**Lincoln:**
> "Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee just proved him wrong."

---

## PART 3: THE RAID LAUNCHES (JUNE 14-17, 1864)

### JUNE 1, 1864 - SEALED ORDERS

**Longstreet's Headquarters, Orange Court House:**

**Longstreet hands envelope to Pickett:**

> "George, your sealed orders. Open them June 14th. Follow them exactly. Bring your men home."

**Pickett:** "What's the objective?"

**Longstreet:** "Everything military between the Potomac and Philadelphia. Burn it all. Make them scream."

---

**Sealed Orders (Opened June 14):**

> TO: Major General George E. Pickett, Commanding Flying Corps
> FROM: Lieutenant General James Longstreet, Commanding ANV
>
> MISSION: Conduct deep raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, 14 June - 31 July 1864 (maximum duration).
>
> OBJECTIVES:
> 1. Destroy B&O Railroad main line (multiple locations)
> 2. Destroy Northern Central Railroad (maximum extent possible)
> 3. Disrupt Reading coal operations (if opportunity presents)
> 4. Destroy Philadelphia-Washington rail connections
> 5. Create maximum panic and destruction
> 6. Return safely with entire force intact
>
> RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:
> - NO major battles (avoid Union infantry at all costs)
> - NO attacks on fortified positions
> - NO prolonged engagements (raid and run)
> - NO violence against civilians (military targets only)
> - Issue receipts for supplies taken from civilians
>
> ROUTE AUTHORITY:
> You have complete freedom of movement. Choose crossing points, routes, targets as tactical situation dictates. Trust your judgment.
>
> CRITICAL PRIORITIES (in order):
> 1. Preserve the corps (bring every man home)
> 2. Destroy infrastructure
> 3. Create panic
>
> If you must choose between destroying a target and preserving your force, PRESERVE YOUR FORCE. We can raid again later. We cannot replace these men.
>
> COMMUNICATION:
> Maintain courier contact when possible. Send situation reports via sympathetic civilians or couriers through safe routes.
>
> FINAL GUIDANCE:
> You command 14,000 of our best men. The entire Confederate war effort depends on Northern war-weariness leading to McClellan's victory in November. This raid is designed to prove the North cannot defend itself, boost the peace movement, and ensure Copperhead electoral victory.
>
> Military effect: Moderate (railroads can be repaired)
> Political effect: Decisive (may win the war)
>
> Ride north. Burn everything military. Never fight a battle you can avoid. Bring every man home.
>
> Good luck and Godspeed.
>
> James Longstreet

---

### JUNE 14, 1864 - THE CROSSING BEGINS

**03:00 - Movement Begins:**

**Departure Point:** Gordonsville, Virginia

**Column:** 14,000 mounted men, 24 guns, 2,500 spare horses, supply wagons

**Route:** Northwest toward Potomac crossings

**Destination:** Point of Rocks and Edwards Ferry (dual crossing to speed process)

---

**Union Intelligence Failure:**

**June 14 Morning - Hancock's HQ:**

**Cavalry Report:** "Confederate movement observed at Gordonsville. Appears to be corps-sized force moving northwest."

**Hancock's Assessment:** "Longstreet is shifting position. Possibly preparing attack on our right flank at Occoquan. Alert right-flank divisions. Cavalry to screen."

**Reality:** Pickett is heading for Maryland, not Occoquan. Hancock completely misreads Confederate intent.

---

### JUNE 15, 1864 - APPROACH TO POTOMAC

**Pickett's Force Reaches Potomac:**

**18:00 - Point of Rocks/Edwards Ferry Area:**

**Pickett's Dispositions:**
- Garnett's and Kemper's brigades (~3,000 men) → Point of Rocks ford
- Armistead's and Corse's brigades (~2,500 men) → Edwards Ferry
- Cavalry brigades (~4,500 men) → Split between both crossings
- Artillery and supply train → Edwards Ferry (easier crossing)

**Union Defenses at Crossings:**
- Point of Rocks: Small garrison, ~200 men (militia)
- Edwards Ferry: No garrison (ford undefended)

---

**19:00-22:00: Initial Crossings:**

**Point of Rocks:**
- Garnett's Brigade crosses first (militia garrison flees after token resistance)
- Kemper's Brigade follows
- By 22:00: ~3,000 men on Maryland shore

**Edwards Ferry:**
- Armistead's Brigade crosses unopposed
- Corse's Brigade follows
- Artillery fords successfully (water only 2-3 feet deep)
- By 22:00: ~2,500 men + 24 guns on Maryland shore

**Union Reaction:** None yet (telegraph lines cut by advance cavalry)

---

### JUNE 16, 1864 - COMPLETING THE CROSSING

**Dawn - Remaining Forces Cross:**

**06:00-12:00:**
- Cavalry brigades complete crossing
- Supply wagons ford successfully
- Spare horses brought across
- By noon: Entire Flying Corps (14,000 men) on Maryland shore

**12:00 - Pickett Consolidates:**

**Location:** Poolesville, Maryland (5 miles east of Point of Rocks)

**Pickett's Orders:**
> "Gentlemen, we are now 14,000 men deep in enemy territory with no support and no retreat route if this goes wrong. From here on, we move fast, strike hard, and never stop long enough for Hancock to catch us.
>
> First objective: B&O Railroad main line. Monocacy Junction, 12 miles north. We ride at 14:00."

---

**14:00-18:00: March to Monocacy:**

**Route:** Poolesville → Monocacy Junction (12 miles)

**Speed:** 4 mph (sustainable pace with artillery)

**18:00:** Reach Monocacy Junction

---

### JUNE 16-17, 1864 - FIRST STRIKE: MONOCACY RAILROAD BRIDGE

**18:30-22:00: Destruction Operations:**

**Target:** Monocacy Railroad Bridge (B&O main line crossing over Monocacy River)

**Importance:** Critical bridge on B&O main line between Baltimore and Cumberland. Main route for coal, supplies, troops between East and Midwest.

**Specifications:**
- Wooden trestle bridge, 400 feet long
- Stone piers (7 total)
- High traffic volume (6-8 trains daily)

---

**Destruction Method:**

**18:30-19:30: Secure Area**
- Cavalry clears both approaches
- Small Union garrison (80 men) at bridge flees
- Picket lines established 2 miles out

**19:30-21:00: Burn Bridge**
- Pioneer company sets fire to wooden trestle
- Oil-soaked straw accelerates burning
- Bridge fully engulfed by 20:30

**21:00-22:00: Drop Piers**
- Powder charges placed on three center piers
- Simultaneous detonation at 21:45
- Three piers collapse into river

**22:00: Assessment**
- Bridge completely destroyed
- Repair estimate: 4-6 weeks minimum (need new trestle, rebuild piers)
- B&O main line severed

---

**Union Reaction (June 17, Dawn):**

**Baltimore:**
- Telegraph lines to west dead (Pickett's advance cavalry cut them)
- No trains arriving from west
- Courier arrives dawn: "Monocacy Bridge destroyed. Large Confederate force in Maryland."

**PANIC**

**Baltimore Mayor to Governor:**
> "Confederate force of unknown size has destroyed Monocacy Bridge. Baltimore may be next. Request immediate reinforcement from Hancock."

**Governor to Washington:**
> "REBELS IN MARYLAND. REQUEST IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE."

---

**Washington Reaction (June 17, Morning):**

**Lincoln's Emergency Cabinet (08:00):**

**Stanton (reading dispatch):**
> "Large Confederate force crossed Potomac yesterday. Destroyed Monocacy Bridge. Currently whereabouts unknown. Baltimore threatened."

**Lincoln:**
> "How large?"

**Stanton:**
> "Unknown. Reports range from 2,000 cavalry to 20,000 all arms."

**Lincoln:**
> "Where is Hancock?"

**Stanton:**
> "Still on the Occoquan. He's been telegraphed. Moving north now."

**Lincoln:**
> "If Longstreet has sent a large force into Maryland, why? What's the objective?"

**Halleck:**
> "Unknown. Could be raid. Could be invasion. Could be diversion for attack elsewhere."

**Lincoln:**
> "Find out. And stop them."

---

**Hancock's Response (June 17):**

**Telegraph to Washington:**
> Dispatching cavalry division (Buford, 4,000 sabers) to Maryland immediately. Main army marching north to intercept Confederate force. Will determine size and intent, then engage.

**Reality:** Hancock is 50+ miles south. Buford's cavalry won't reach Maryland for 24+ hours. By then, Pickett will be 40+ miles away.

---

**June 17 Evening - Pickett's Status:**

**Location:** 15 miles north of Monocacy Junction, camped near New Market, Maryland

**Day's Accomplishments:**
- Crossed Potomac undetected
- Destroyed critical B&O Railroad bridge
- Evaded Union response
- Zero casualties

**Pickett's Assessment to staff:**
> "One bridge down. Dozens more to go. They still don't know where we are or what we're doing. This is working exactly as planned."

---

## PART 4: THE RAMPAGE (JUNE 18-28, 1864)

### JUNE 18-22: SEVERING THE B&O RAILROAD

**Strategic Objective:** Cut B&O Railroad at multiple points to prevent rapid repair

**Method:** Strike 4-5 different locations simultaneously, overwhelm Union repair capacity

**Union Response:** None effective (Union forces always 12-24 hours behind)

---

### JUNE 18-21: COLUMN 2 - CENTRAL STRIKES

**Kemper's Brigade + Lomax's Cavalry:**

**June 18-19 - Westminster Area:**
- Destroy Western Maryland Railroad junction
- Burn 2 bridges over Piney Run

---

### JUNE 19-22: COLUMN 3 - NORTHERN STRIKES

**Armistead's Brigade + Corse's Brigade + Artillery:**

**June 19 - Cross into Pennsylvania:**
- First Confederate troops in Pennsylvania since October 1863
- Pennsylvania civilians terrified (memories of 1863 POD Campaign)
- Armistead issues proclamation: "We mean no harm to civilians. Stay in your homes."

**June 20-21 - Hanover Junction:**
- Critical junction: Northern Central Railroad meets Hanover Branch Railroad
- Strategic importance: Coal trains from anthracite fields pass through here
- Destruction:
  - 3 bridges burned
  - Railroad depot destroyed
  - 12 locomotives disabled (fireboxes destroyed)
  - 80+ coal cars burned
  - Telegraph lines cut for 20 miles

**June 22 - York Approaches:**

- Armistead demands supplies (food, horses)
- City complies (pays ransom to avoid destruction)
- Armistead leaves York intact, marches southwest

---

### JUNE 22 - REUNIFICATION

**Location:** New Oxford, Pennsylvania (10 miles east of Gettysburg)

**All Three Columns Reunite:**
- Column 1 (Garnett/Fitzhugh Lee): Arrives from west
- Column 2 (Kemper/Lomax): Arrives from south  
- Column 3 (Armistead/Corse): Already at New Oxford

**Flying Corps back to full strength: 14,000 men** (minus ~80 casualties from skirmishes)

---

**Pickett's Assessment (June 22 Evening):**

> "Four days of operations. Results:
> - B&O Railroad cut at 4 locations
> - Northern Central Railroad damaged severely
> - Western Maryland Railroad destroyed
> - Dozens of bridges burned
> - Hundreds of supply cars destroyed
> - Union completely unable to respond (always 24+ hours behind)
> - Our casualties: 80 men (0.6%)
>
> The plan is working perfectly. Next objective: Reading area. Hit the coal again. Make them remember 1863."

---

**Union Status (June 22):**

**Hancock's Position:** Frederick, Maryland (30 miles behind Pickett)

**Hancock's Intelligence:** "Confederate force estimated 10,000-15,000, all mounted. Moving rapidly through Maryland/Pennsylvania. Impossible to intercept with infantry. Cavalry insufficient to engage."

**Hancock's Dilemma:** "I can chase them, but I can't catch them. They're moving 30-40 miles per day. My infantry does 15 miles. By the time I reach where they were, they're gone."

---

### JUNE 23-28: THE COAL PANIC

**Strategic Objective:** Disrupt Reading coal shipments (again), create economic/political panic

---

**June 23 - March to Reading:**

**Route:** New Oxford → Abbottstown → Hanover → York County → Lancaster County → Reading approaches

**Distance:** 50 miles

**Duration:** 2 days (June 23-24) - forced march

**June 24 Evening:** Flying Corps reaches Reading approaches

---

**June 25-27: READING AREA OPERATIONS**

**Pickett's Strategy:** "We're not occupying Reading like 1863. We're destroying the railroads that carry coal OUT of Reading."

**Three Days of Destruction:**

**June 25 - Reading Railroad (East):**
- Strike between Reading and Philadelphia
- Burn 3 major bridges over Schuylkill River
- Destroy Phoenixville station and depot
- Tear up 15 miles of track

- Lebanon station facilities destroyed

**June 27 - East Penn Railroad (South):**
- Connection to Philadelphia via Allentown
- 2 major bridges dropped
- Allentown junction destroyed
- 8 miles of track torn up

---

**Coal Shipment Impact:**

**Before Raid:** Reading area shipping 15,000 tons coal/day to Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore

**After Raid:** Zero tons/day (all rail connections severed)

**Repair Estimate:** 6-8 weeks minimum to restore any single line, 12+ weeks to restore full capacity

**Economic Impact:** Coal shortages in Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York within 2 weeks. Industry disrupted. Heating coal prices spike. Political pressure immense.

---

**June 28 - Civilian Interaction:**

**Reading Mayor's Delegation Meets Pickett:**

**Mayor:** "General, you destroyed our railroads in 1863. Now you're back doing it again. Why?"

**Pickett:** "Your railroads supply the Union war effort. Until your government negotiates peace, we will continue disrupting them. This is war, Mr. Mayor."

**Mayor:** "You could just... leave us alone. We're civilians."

**Pickett:** "So are our civilians in Virginia, who've been suffering Union armies for three years. When you ask Lincoln to stop, we'll stop. Until then, we do what we must."

**No violence against Reading civilians. But economic devastation complete.**

---

## PART 5: THE CHESAPEAKE RAMPAGE (JUNE 29 - JULY 10, 1864)

### JUNE 29 - SHIFT TO CHESAPEAKE OPERATIONS

**Pickett's Decision:** "We've hit Reading. Now we hit the Philadelphia-Washington rail connection."

**Strategic Importance:** Critical supply line. If severed, Philadelphia isolated from Washington.

---

**June 29-30 - March to Chesapeake:**

**Route:** Reading → Lancaster → Chester County → Delaware border

**Distance:** 60 miles

**Duration:** 2 days

**June 30 Evening:** Flying Corps reaches Wilmington approaches

**Result:** Philadelphia-Washington rail connection severed. Susquehanna crossing destroyed. Union naval presence eliminated.

---

**July 5, Evening - Pickett's Assessment:**

> "We just fought our first real battle of the raid - and we won easily. But we took casualties. And we're 3 weeks into enemy territory now. Time to think about going home.
>
> But first... one more target."

---

### JULY 6-10: THE BALTIMORE PANIC

**Strategic Situation:**
- Baltimore is 30 miles southwest of Havre de Grace
- City is panicked (railroads cut, gunboats destroyed, Confederate force nearby)
- Baltimore garrison: ~5,000 (mix of militia, garrison troops, convalescents)

**Pickett's Decision:** "We're not attacking Baltimore. Too strong. But we can threaten it. Make them panic. Then ride home."

---

**July 6-8: Circling Baltimore:**

**Pickett's Maneuver:**
- Ride around Baltimore in wide arc (20-30 miles from city)
- Destroy railroad connections at multiple points

- Destroy track at Cockeysville (15 miles north of Baltimore)
- Burn station, telegraph office
- 8 miles of track torn up

**July 7 - Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (Baltimore-Washington line):**
- Destroy track at Relay (10 miles southwest of Baltimore)

- 6 miles of track destroyed

**July 8 - Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (Baltimore-Philadelphia line):**
- Destroy track at Gunpowder River crossing (12 miles northeast of Baltimore)
- Burn bridge over Gunpowder River
- 10 miles of track destroyed

---

**Result:** Baltimore isolated
- No railroad connections north (to Harrisburg)
- No railroad connections south (to Washington)
- No railroad connections east (to Philadelphia)
- No railroad connections west (to Cumberland)
- Telegraph lines dead in all directions
- City in complete panic

---

**Baltimore Mayor to Washington (Courier, July 9):**

> We are besieged. All railroads cut. Telegraph dead. Rebel force estimated 15,000 surrounds city. Request immediate relief. Food supplies adequate for 2 weeks. Cannot hold if attacked.

**Washington Response:**

**Lincoln (July 9, Emergency Cabinet):**
> "They've been rampaging through Maryland and Pennsylvania for three weeks. They've destroyed every railroad in the region. They just burned our gunboats. And now they're isolating Baltimore. WHERE IS HANCOCK?"

**Stanton:**
> "Hancock is marching north from Frederick. He should reach Baltimore area July 12-13."

**Lincoln:**
> "That's four days from now! What do the rebels do for four days?"

**Halleck:**
> "Unknown. But their pattern suggests they're finishing operations and preparing to withdraw."

**Lincoln:**
> "Can we intercept their withdrawal?"

**Halleck:**
> "We can try. But they've evaded us for three weeks. Odds are they'll evade us again."

---

**July 9-10 - Pickett's Final Operations:**

**July 9 - Supply Raid:**
- Strike Annapolis supply depot (garrison flees)
- Seize food, forage, medical supplies
- Burn military stores (ammunition, weapons)
- Do NOT burn civilian property

**July 10 - Final Assessment:**

**Pickett's Staff Meeting:**

**Pickett:** "Gentlemen, we've been behind enemy lines for 26 days. Our casualties total about 150 men - less than 1% loss rate. We've destroyed dozens of railroads, burned hundreds of bridges, eliminated three gunboats, and panicked every city from Baltimore to Reading.

Time to go home. Hancock's army is approaching. If we stay much longer, we risk getting trapped. We ride south tomorrow."

---

## PART 6: THE RETURN (JULY 11-22, 1864)

### JULY 11-15: FIGHTING WITHDRAWAL

**Challenge:** Return to Virginia with Hancock's army trying to intercept

**Pickett's Strategy:** "We've been raiders. Now we're an army trying to get home. Speed is survival."

---

**July 11 - Departure from Baltimore Area:**

**06:00:** Flying Corps concentrates at Annapolis area
**08:00:** Begin march south toward Potomac crossings
**Route:** Annapolis → Upper Marlboro → Piscataway → Potomac

**Result:** Road to Potomac remains open. Main column (12,000 men) bypasses battle site, continues south.

---

**July 13 - Approach to Potomac:**

**Flying Corps reaches Piscataway area (15 miles from Potomac crossings)**

**Challenge:** Hancock's infantry (40,000 men) closing from northwest, will arrive July 14-15

**Pickett's Assessment:** "We have maybe 24 hours to cross the Potomac before Hancock arrives. If he catches us during crossing, we're vulnerable. Must cross FAST."

---

### POLITICAL IMPACT

**Northern Reaction (July-August 1864):**

**Newspapers:**

**New York Times (July 25):**
> "THE RAID THAT HUMILIATED THE NORTH"
> "14,000 Rebels Rampage For Six Weeks, Destroy Railroads At Will, Return Home Safely"
> "Where Was Hancock? Where Was Our Army?"

**Harper's Weekly (August 1):**
> "PICKETT'S RAID PROVES WHAT LONGSTREET'S DEFENSE SHOWED: WE CANNOT WIN THIS WAR"
> "If They Can Strike This Deep Into Our Territory With Impunity, How Can We Ever Conquer The South?"

**Philadelphia Inquirer (July 28):**
> "PENNSYLVANIA RAILROADS DESTROYED - AGAIN"
> "Reading Coal Industry Paralyzed - AGAIN"
> "How Many Times Must We Suffer Before Lincoln Admits Defeat?"

---

**Copperhead Papers:**

**New York World (July 26):**
> "PICKETT'S RAID EXPOSES LINCOLN'S FAILURE"
> "Three Years of War. Hundreds of Thousands Dead. Billions Spent. AND REBELS RAID WITH IMPUNITY."
> "Vote McClellan. End This Madness."

**Chicago Times (July 30):**
> "THE LESSON OF PICKETT'S RAID: The South Cannot Be Conquered"
> "NEGOTIATE PEACE NOW"

---

**Public Opinion Shift:**

**Pre-Raid (June 1864):**
- Support for war: 52%
- Support for peace negotiations: 48%

**Post-Raid (August 1864):**
- Support for war: 38%
- Support for peace negotiations: 62%

**Change:** 14-point swing toward peace (the raid's effect)

---

**Political Conventions:**

**Democratic Convention (August 29-31, 1864, Chicago):**

**Platform:**
> "After four years of failure to restore the Union by war... it is time for peace. The Democratic Party calls for immediate cessation of hostilities and negotiation with the Confederate States."

**Nominee:** General George B. McClellan

**McClellan's Campaign Message:**
> "Lincoln has failed. The war is unwinnable. Pickett's raid proved the South can strike anywhere while we cannot even defend Maryland. I will negotiate peace with honor."

---

**Republican Response:**

**Lincoln (August 23, Private memo - "Blind Memorandum"):**

> "This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration, as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards."

**Translation:** Lincoln expects to lose to McClellan. Peace negotiations will follow. The Union will not be restored.

---

### MILITARY IMPACT

**Union Army Morale:**

**Hancock's Report to Washington (August 5):**

> "The army's morale has been severely damaged by Pickett's raid. The men understand that an enemy force rampaged through Maryland and Pennsylvania for six weeks while we chased futilely behind. They feel humiliated. They question the point of continuing the war if we cannot even protect our own territory.
>
> Desertion rates have increased significantly. Combat effectiveness has decreased. The army can still defend positions but offensive spirit is nearly gone.
>
> Without major strategic change or political settlement, this army will continue deteriorating."

---

**Confederate Army Morale:**

**Longstreet to Davis (August 10):**

> "Pickett's raid has had extraordinary effect on Confederate morale. The men believe we can win this war - not by conquering the North, but by exhausting them until they quit.
>
> The Flying Corps returned as heroes. Entire army believes we can strike anywhere, destroy anything, and the Yankees cannot stop us.
>
> Combined with our successful defense on the Rappahannock-Rapidan line, Confederate soldiers now believe ultimate victory is inevitable - through Northern political collapse, not battlefield triumph.
>
> This confidence is our greatest strategic asset."

---

### STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

**What Pickett's Raid Proved:**

1. **Confederate Strategic Reach:** South can strike deep into North at will
2. **Union Defensive Failure:** North cannot protect own territory despite numerical superiority
3. **War is Unwinnable (for North):** Cannot conquer South while South raids North freely
4. **Political > Military:** Raid's political impact (peace movement boost) far exceeds military damage
5. **Longstreet's Strategic Genius:** Defensive strength + offensive raids = perfect strategy

---

**Longstreet's Post-Raid Assessment (August 15):**

> "We have achieved what I hoped. The raid proved we can strike anywhere. The Northern people now understand their armies cannot protect them. Political pressure for peace is overwhelming.
>
> McClellan will win in November. He'll negotiate peace. Confederate independence will be secured.
>
> We won this war not on battlefields but in Northern minds. Pickett's raid was the final blow to Northern will to continue."

---

**Historical Significance:**

Pickett's Lightning Raid will be remembered as:
- The raid that broke Northern will
- Proof that Confederate strategy of defense + raids was unbeatable
- The event that guaranteed McClellan's victory
- The military operation that won political victory
- Longstreet's masterpiece

In combination with:
- Rappahannock-Rapidan defensive victory (October 1863)
- Northern morale collapse (winter 1863-64)
- Pickett's raid (summer 1864)

...the path to Confederate independence is assured.
