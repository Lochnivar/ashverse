# Roaring Twenties in the NTL: Do They Happen?

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether the "Roaring 20s" economic boom occurs in the NTL, and if so, how it differs from OTL

---

## OTL ROARING TWENTIES: WHAT MADE IT HAPPEN

### Primary Drivers (1920-1929)

1. **Post-WWI Economic Boom**
   - War production → peacetime conversion
   - Massive industrial capacity
   - Pent-up consumer demand
   - War debt paid by European allies

2. **Stock Market Speculation**
   - Margin buying
   - Irrational exuberance
   - New investors (middle class)
   - Easy credit

3. **Consumer Credit Expansion**
   - Installment buying
   - Automobiles, radios, appliances
   - Middle-class consumption boom

4. **Industrial Production Surge**
   - Mass production (Fordism)
   - New industries (automotive, radio, aviation)
   - Productivity gains

5. **Real Estate Speculation**
   - Florida land boom
   - Urban expansion
   - Construction boom

6. **Prohibition (Bootlegging Money)**
   - Illegal alcohol trade
   - Organized crime profits
   - Money laundering

7. **Federal Reserve Policy**
   - Easy credit
   - Low interest rates
   - Money supply expansion

## NTL DIFFERENCES THAT AFFECT THE ROARING 20S

### 1. Three Separate Nations (Not One Unified Economy)

**OTL:** Single unified economy with federal policies  
**NTL:** Three separate economies (USA, CSA, California) with different policies

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **Different timing:** Each nation could experience boom at different times
- **Different severity:** Some nations might boom more than others
- **Different drivers:** Each nation has different economic structures
- **Trade barriers:** Existing tariffs between nations could amplify or dampen effects
- **Currency differences:** Three separate currencies could create exchange rate issues

**Assessment:** Makes boom **less synchronized**, potentially **less unified**, but each nation could still experience its own boom.

---

### 2. WWI Participation (1917-1918)

**OTL:** US enters 1917, massive war production, emerges as creditor nation  
**NTL:** All three nations enter 1917 (Zimmerman Telegram), but different participation levels

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **War production:** Each nation produces differently (USA industrial, CSA agricultural, California oil)
- **War debt:** European allies pay war debts to all three nations (or just USA?)
- **Industrial capacity:** USA has massive capacity, CSA less, California oil-focused
- **Pent-up demand:** All three nations have consumers wanting goods

**Assessment:** **Similar to OTL** - WWI still happens, all three nations participate, war production creates capacity, pent-up demand exists. But **less unified** - three separate booms, not one.

---

### 3. California Oil Wealth (Pre-Existing)

**OTL:** US oil production, but not dominant global player  
**NTL:** California already rich from oil (1873-1917), massive revenue stream

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **Already booming:** California might already be in a "roaring" state before 1920s
- **Less dramatic change:** California's boom might be continuous, not a "post-war" boom
- **Different character:** California's boom is oil-driven, not industrial conversion
- **Wealth effect:** California's existing wealth might amplify 1920s boom

**Assessment:** California might experience **continuous boom** (not just 1920s), or **amplified 1920s** due to existing wealth.

---

### 4. Different Banking Systems

**OTL:** Single Federal Reserve system, easy credit  
**NTL:** Three separate banking systems, three separate currencies

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **Different credit policies:** Each nation sets its own interest rates
- **Different money supply:** Each nation controls its own currency
- **Cross-border capital flows:** Money might flow between nations (California → USA/CSA?)
- **Currency exchange:** Exchange rates could create arbitrage opportunities

**Assessment:** **More complex** - three separate systems means three separate credit booms, but cross-border flows could amplify effects.

---

### 5. Different Trade Relationships

**OTL:** Unified US trade policy  
**NTL:** Three separate trade policies, tariffs normalized by 1905-1920, California-Japan relationship

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **Tariff normalization:** Punitive tariffs (300% on CSA slave-grown goods) were reaction to Toombs Act and slavery imports. By 1905, slavery is legally dead, so tariffs are dropped to normalize relations (likely 1905-1920 timeframe). This **enables** trade boom between USA-CSA.
- **California trade:** California-Japan trade relationship might be more stable/continuous
- **Trade diversification:** Three nations trading with different partners reduces single-point-of-failure risk
- **Post-1905 trade boom:** With tariffs normalized, USA-CSA trade could boom in 1920s (similar to OTL)

**Assessment:** **Positive effect** - tariff normalization by 1905-1920 enables USA-CSA trade boom in 1920s. California's diversified trade (Japan, Asia) provides continuous growth. Trade barriers removed, so boom is more likely.

---

### 6. Agricultural Situation

**OTL:** Farm crisis in 1920s (post-war glut)  
**NTL:** Different agricultural systems:
- **USA:** Industrial agriculture, but smaller territory
- **CSA:** Already experienced agricultural crisis (cotton glut 1880s), agriculture already restructured
- **California:** Diversified agriculture, less vulnerable

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **CSA:** Already restructured after cotton glut - might be more resilient
- **USA:** Smaller agricultural base, but still vulnerable to post-war glut
- **California:** Diversified, less vulnerable
- **Post-war glut:** Still possible, but affects different nations differently

**Assessment:** **Less severe** - CSA already restructured, California diversified, USA smaller. But post-war agricultural glut could still happen.

---

### 7. Prohibition

**OTL:** National Prohibition (1920-1933), bootlegging money  
**NTL:** Three separate nations - do they all have prohibition?

**Impact on Roaring 20s:**
- **USA:** Might have prohibition (similar to OTL)
- **CSA:** Might not have prohibition (different culture)
- **California:** Might not have prohibition (pragmatic, trade-focused)
- **Cross-border bootlegging:** Could create new trade routes (California → USA?)

**Assessment:** **Different by nation** - USA might have prohibition, CSA/California might not. Cross-border bootlegging could create new economic activity.

## SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Scenario 1: Roaring 20s Still Happen (All Three Nations) - 70%

**Mechanism:**
- WWI still happens (1917-1918), all three nations participate
- War production creates industrial capacity
- Pent-up consumer demand exists
- Post-war conversion to peacetime production
- Stock market speculation exists in all three nations

**Differences:**
- **Timing:** Might be slightly different (1921-1930, or 1920-1929)
- **Severity:** Potentially less unified (three separate booms)
- **Character:** Each nation has different boom drivers (USA industrial, CSA agricultural, California oil)

**Plausibility:** 70% - Core drivers (post-war boom, pent-up demand, speculation) still exist, but NTL differences mean less unified boom.

---

### Scenario 2: Partial Roaring 20s (Some Nations Boom, Others Don't) - 80%

**Mechanism:**
- USA: Industrial boom (similar to OTL)
- CSA: Agricultural/industrial boom (enabled by tariff normalization 1905-1920)
- California: Continuous boom (already rich from oil, less dramatic change)

**Differences:**
- **USA:** Classic "Roaring 20s" - industrial conversion, stock market, consumer credit
- **CSA:** Moderate boom - agricultural recovery, some industrial growth, **trade boom with USA enabled by tariff normalization**
- **California:** Continuous growth - oil revenue, trade, less dramatic "roaring" character

**Plausibility:** 80% - More realistic given NTL structure. Each nation experiences different levels of boom. Tariff normalization enables USA-CSA trade boom, making CSA boom more likely.

---

### Scenario 3: No Unified Roaring 20s (Different Economic Cycles) - 80%

**Mechanism:**
- Three separate economies don't synchronize
- Each nation experiences different economic cycles
- No unified "Roaring 20s" - instead, three separate booms at different times

**Differences:**
- **USA:** Boom 1921-1928 (post-war industrial conversion)
- **CSA:** Boom 1923-1930 (agricultural recovery, some industrial growth)
- **California:** Continuous growth 1919-1929 (oil revenue, trade expansion)

**Plausibility:** 80% - Most realistic given NTL structure. Three separate economies mean three separate cycles.

---

### Scenario 4: No Roaring 20s at All (Avoided) - 40%

**Mechanism:**
- Trade barriers prevent boom
- Three separate economies too small to generate unified boom
- California already rich, no dramatic change
- USA/CSA too constrained by tariffs and borders

**Differences:**
- **Mild growth:** 1920s are steady but not "roaring"
- **No speculation bubble:** Stock markets don't boom
- **No consumer credit expansion:** Credit remains tight

**Plausibility:** 40% - Possible but unlikely. Post-war booms are common, and pent-up demand would still exist.

## FACTOR-BY-FACTOR ANALYSIS

### Overall Comparison

| OTL Factor | NTL Impact | Likelihood Still Causes Boom | Assessment |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------------|------------|
| **Post-WWI Economic Boom** | Three separate nations | 75% | Still likely, but less unified |
| **Stock Market Speculation** | Three separate markets | 70% | Still likely, but less synchronized |
| **Consumer Credit Expansion** | Three separate systems | 65% | Different by nation, less unified |
| **Industrial Production Surge** | Different structures | 70% | USA likely, CSA/California less so |
| **Real Estate Speculation** | Three separate markets | 65% | Still possible, but isolated |
| **Prohibition (Bootlegging)** | Varies by nation | 60% | USA might have it, others might not |
| **Federal Reserve Policy** | Three separate systems | 65% | Different policies, less unified |

### Detailed Northern U.S. Comparison (OTL vs. NTL)

**LOCKED CANON - CORRECTED DECEMBER 5, 2025**

| Factor | OTL U.S. (1917–1918) | NTL Northern U.S. (1917–1919) | Effect on the 1920s Boom |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Wartime production orders** | Yes (massive) | Yes (still massive, 1917–1919) | Factories **do** scale up |
| **Length of war participation** | 19 months | ~24 months (slightly longer war in NTL) | Slightly **more** capacity than OTL |
| **Post-war capital availability** | High (California gold + European loans to one nation) | **Much lower** (no California gold, European loans split three ways) | **Much weaker** conversion boom |
| **Unified national market** | Yes | No – three separate economies | Fragmented consumer spending |
| **Final 1920s boom** | Full Roaring Twenties | **Flickering Twenties** (regional, patchy, ends early) | Correct label, corrected cause |

**LOCKED SUMMARY:**

The North **does** get a wartime industrial surge (1917–1919), but the boom is **crippled** by:
- No California gold inflows
- European war debt split three ways instead of one
- Three separate currencies and tariff walls
- Shorter post-war credit bubble (no single Federal Reserve to juice it)

**Result:** Factories scale up… then sit half-idle when the orders stop and the money never arrives.

**"The Flickering Twenties"** is still 100% correct. The cause is now canon-accurate: **not "no war orders" – but "war orders without the money to turn them into a decade-long party."**

## MY ASSESSMENT

### Most Likely Outcome: **Partial Roaring 20s / Different Economic Cycles (80%)**

**Not a unified "Roaring 20s" as we know it, but:**
- **USA:** **"The Flickering Twenties"** - regional mini-booms in New York, Chicago, Boston; rest of the North feels like the 1890s never ended. **Wartime industrial surge (1917-1919) does happen** - factories scale up, but boom is **crippled** by: no California gold inflows, European war debt split three ways, three separate currencies, shorter post-war credit bubble. Factories scale up… then sit half-idle when orders stop and money never arrives. Much smaller stock market bubble (California money stays west, Europe pays reparations to three nations). Consumer credit only in big cities; rural areas stay cash-based. Florida land boom still happens (one bright spot, but isolated). (1921-1928)
- **CSA:** Moderate boom - agricultural recovery, some industrial growth, **trade boom with USA enabled by tariff normalization (1905-1920)** (1923-1930)
- **California:** Continuous growth - oil revenue, trade expansion, less dramatic "roaring" character (1919-1929)

**Key Differences:**
- **Less synchronized:** Three separate booms, not one unified boom
- **Different drivers:** Each nation has different boom drivers
- **Different severity:** USA "Flickering" (regional, not national), CSA moderate (but enabled by tariff normalization), California continuous
- **USA limitations:** Wartime industrial base exists (1917-1919), but boom crippled by no California gold, European debt split three ways, three separate currencies, shorter credit bubble. Much smaller stock market bubble, patchy consumer credit
- **Different timing:** Booms might start/end at different times
- **Trade normalization:** Tariff normalization (1905-1920) enables USA-CSA trade boom, making CSA boom more likely

### Plausibility Score: **80%**

**Justification:**
- Post-war booms are **highly likely** (WWI still happens, pent-up demand exists)
- **Tariff normalization (1905-1920)** enables USA-CSA trade boom, making boom more likely
- But NTL structure means **less unified** (three nations, different policies)
- Each nation experiences **different levels of boom** (USA "Flickering" not "Roaring" - factories scale up but boom crippled by lack of capital, CSA moderate but enabled by trade, California continuous)
- **No unified "Roaring 20s"** - instead, three separate economic cycles
- **USA specifically:** Wartime industrial surge (1917-1919) happens, but factories sit half-idle when orders stop and money never arrives

### Alternative: **Roaring 20s Still Happen (70%)**

If you want the classic "Roaring 20s" narrative:
- **Timing:** 1920-1929 (similar to OTL)
- **Severity:** Potentially less unified (three separate booms)
- **Character:** Each nation has different boom drivers

## IMPLICATIONS FOR GREAT DEPRESSION ANALYSIS

### If Roaring 20s Don't Happen (or Are Partial):

**Impact on Depression:**
- **No speculative bubble to burst:** Stock market crash might be less dramatic
- **No consumer credit collapse:** Credit contraction might be less severe
- **Different triggers:** Depression might be triggered by different factors (trade war, oil price collapse, currency crisis)
- **Less synchronized:** Three separate crises, not one unified depression

**Revised Depression Analysis:**
- **Plausibility:** 70% (instead of 75%)
- **Mechanism:** Trade war, oil price collapse, currency crisis (instead of stock market crash)
- **Timing:** 1929-1935 (flexible, potentially delayed)
- **Severity:** Less severe overall (no unified speculative bubble)

### If Roaring 20s Still Happen (All Three Nations):

**Impact on Depression:**
- **Speculative bubble exists:** Stock market crash still possible
- **Consumer credit collapse:** Credit contraction still possible
- **Similar triggers:** Depression might be triggered by similar factors (stock market crash, banking collapse)
- **More synchronized:** Three separate crises, but more unified

**Revised Depression Analysis:**
- **Plausibility:** 75% (as originally assessed)
- **Mechanism:** Stock market crash, banking collapse (similar to OTL)
- **Timing:** 1929-1933 (similar to OTL)
- **Severity:** Potentially less severe overall (California buffer, isolated failures)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ Option 1: Partial Roaring 20s / Different Economic Cycles (LOCKED AS CANON)
- **Plausibility:** 80%
- **Narrative:** More interesting, reflects NTL differences
- **Mechanism:** Three separate booms at different times, different drivers
- **Timing:** USA 1921-1928, CSA 1923-1930, California 1919-1929
- **Status:** **LOCKED AS CANON** - This is the official outcome for the NTL

### Option 2: Roaring 20s Still Happen (All Three Nations)
- **Plausibility:** 70%
- **Narrative:** Familiar, allows classic boom-bust cycle
- **Mechanism:** Post-war boom, stock market speculation (similar to OTL)
- **Timing:** 1920-1929 (similar to OTL)

### Option 3: No Roaring 20s at All
- **Plausibility:** 40%
- **Narrative:** Optimistic, but less realistic
- **Mechanism:** Small economies prevent boom (tariffs already normalized by 1905, so not a barrier)
- **Timing:** Mild growth instead

---

## KEY INSIGHT

**The "Roaring 20s" as a unified phenomenon probably doesn't happen in the NTL.**

Instead:
- **Three separate economic cycles** (80% plausibility)
- **USA:** **"The Flickering Twenties"** - regional mini-booms in major cities (New York, Chicago, Boston), but rest of the North feels like the 1890s never ended. **Wartime industrial surge (1917-1919) does happen** - factories scale up, but boom is **crippled** by: no California gold inflows, European war debt split three ways, three separate currencies, shorter post-war credit bubble. Factories scale up… then sit half-idle when orders stop and money never arrives. Much smaller stock market bubble, patchy consumer credit. (1921-1928)
- **CSA:** Moderate boom - agricultural recovery, some industrial growth, trade boom with USA enabled by tariff normalization (1923-1930)
- **California:** Continuous growth - oil revenue, trade expansion, less dramatic "roaring" character (1919-1929)

This means:
- **No unified speculative bubble** to burst
- **Different triggers** for economic crisis (trade war, oil price collapse, currency crisis)
- **Less synchronized** depression (three separate crises)
- **Less severe overall** (no unified speculative bubble, USA "Flickering" not "Roaring")

**Recommendation:** Go with "Partial Roaring 20s / Different Economic Cycles" (80%) - it's more plausible and more interesting than assuming OTL Roaring 20s was inevitable. USA experiences **"The Flickering Twenties"** - regional, not national.

---

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Verdict:** Roaring 20s not inevitable - partial/different economic cycles more likely (80%)
