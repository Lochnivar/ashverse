# Cattle Ranching in Native Super-States

## The Critical Rule

In every single one of these Native super-states, **European-style private cattle empires are impossible**.

The moment a white settler (Fairfax or anyone else) tries to run a fenced, branded, "mine" herd of 5,000–20,000 head, the system eats it alive.

## What Actually Happens to Fairfax Cattle

| Super-State | What actually happens to the Fairfax cattle |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | Branded Fairfax cattle graze alongside Cherokee, Creek, and freedmen cattle on open range. Every spring the council does a "community count" and the Fairfax brand suddenly owns 30% fewer cows than it started with. |
| **Dakota** | Lakota hunters and communal herds simply **absorb** the Fairfax cattle. You wake up one morning and your "herd" is part of the tribal buffalo-cattle mix. Good luck proving ownership when every animal has six different brands burned over. |
| **Comanchería** | You pay your annual tribute in cattle. If the band decides 10% isn't enough this year, they just take 25%. Your "private herd" is a moving bank account controlled by someone else. |
| **Navajo** | Sheep and goats only — cattle are considered destructive to the range. Try to run cows and the local headmother fines you one goat per cow per month until you switch or leave. |

## Brands Are Respected Only as Far as Convenient

| Super-State | Official stance on brands | What really happens in practice |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | Brands are registered with the National Council. "Ownership" is recorded. | Every spring the council does a "community count." If your brand is on a cow that grazed tribal grass, the council can claim a percentage as "range fee." Your 100-head herd leaves for market as 65 head more often than not. |
| **Dakota** | Brands exist, but the winter-count council can re-assign any animal to the communal herd for "the good of the people." | Your branded cattle simply become part of the tribal herd. You get compensated in meat or horses – at the council's valuation. |
| **Comanchería** | Brands mean nothing. Possession = ownership. | You brand your cows. The band that protects your range brands over them. You now co-own the herd with your "protectors." |
| **Navajo** | Brands on sheep/goats are respected within the clan. Cattle brands are ignored – cattle are seen as destructive. | Run cattle and your brand is meaningless; the local headmother seizes them for "range damage." |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | Brands are legally recognised on paper. | In practice, the Nation can "reclaim" any branded animal that grazed Outlet grass without a permit. You pay or you lose the cow. |

## Real-World Precedents (All OTL)

- Cherokee Nation 1880s–90s: maintained brand books but regularly overrode them with grazing taxes.
- Lakota 1870s–80s: treated Texas cattle driven onto reservation land as communal property.
- Comanche: literally laughed at white brands; a cow was yours only as long as you could defend it.

## Bottom Line

Brands are **useful bookkeeping** in the super-states, but they are **never** the final word on ownership.

The final word is always: **"Who does the council say the cow belongs to today?"**

A white rancher in any super-state spends every spring culling his own branded cattle out of a larger herd that half the district has a claim on and praying the council's count is generous this year.

## Realistic Outcome for White Cattlemen

- You can get **rich** running cattle.
- You will **never** get a dynasty like the XIT or King Ranch.
- Your herd is always part of a **larger communal or tribute system**.
- Every year the council/clan/band takes its cut — legally, peacefully, and with a smile.

The Fairfax "ranch" in Hoyt by 1890:
- 8,000 acres of prime grassland
- 3,000 head of cattle on the hoof
- **1,100 of which are actually theirs**
- the rest are "community drift" that will be someone else's next spring

There are no white cattle barons in the Native super-states.

There are only the **richest tenants in the communal herd**.

And every year the council reminds them who really owns the grass.
