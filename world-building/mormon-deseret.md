# Mormon Deseret: Sovereign Theocracy

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Deseret is not absorbed, split, or crushed.

It is the one white settler polity that wins the exact same deal as the Native super-states:

"Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone."

And both exhausted American republics sign it  
because neither can afford another Utah War.

Deseret in 2025:

Salt Lake City skyline, temple spires, and a national guard that still drills with 19th-century zeal.

## The Answer

Sovereign, exactly like the Native super-states, and for the exact same reason.

## Status and Mechanism (1865)

| Status | Exact Mechanism (1865) | Realism Check |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Sovereign theocracy** | Treaty of Cincinnati, Article 7 – "The State of Deseret, comprising the Great Basin territory settled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is recognised as a sovereign entity under joint U.S.–Confederate protection." | 10/10 |
| **Borders** | Roughly modern Utah + southern Nevada + small slices of Arizona/Colorado/Idaho (the 1850s State of Deseret proposal, minus California's claims). | 9/10 |
| **Why it survives** | Both U.S. and CSA are terrified of another Mormon War. Brigham Young still commands 15,000 armed men in 1865. Neither side has the troops or will to fight Salt Lake after four years of bleeding. | 10/10 |

## Realistic 1865–2025 Trajectory

| Period | What Deseret Actually Does |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **1865–1877** | Brigham Young rules as de-facto prophet-king. No U.S. governor, no federal troops. |
| **1877–1890** | Succession crisis after Brigham's death → slower polygamy phase-out to keep trade flowing. |
| **1890–1920** | Quietly becomes the Switzerland of the West – banks, mining, neutral broker between California and the fractured U.S. |
| **1920–2025** | Rich, weird, heavily armed theocracy that everyone trades with but nobody quite trusts. |

## The Result

Deseret is not absorbed, split, or crushed.

It is the one white settler polity that wins the exact same deal as the Native super-states:

"Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone."

And both exhausted American republics sign it  
because neither can afford another Utah War.

Deseret in 2025:
