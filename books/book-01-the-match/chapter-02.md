Longstreet's Vigil - Sitting Up With the Dead

July 2, 1863 ~ 00:00
Schmucker House
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania


John Walter stood in the doorway to the parlor of the Schmucker house.  Professor Schmucker's old walnut cased mantle clock ticked in the deathly quiet like a caisson funeral drummer.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

The generals and their officers had begun arriving at around half past two in the morning, John Walter had glanced at the clock as soon as he heard the first officer's spurs dig into the porch outside the open door.  By ones or by more, they gathered in the hall outside of the parlor, their body heat adding to the stiffling Pennsylvania night.  The smell of horse, gun oil and sweat mixed with the all too real sense of fear and panic held tightly reined by years of discipline.  

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

He stood guard, one hand on the doorway and one hand unconsciously on the hilt of his sword.  Longstreet's orders had been brutally clear.  No one, No one, was to be admitted into the parlor without his explicit say-so.  Lee had been taken ill, that was the only word that was to be allowed to spread.  

He hadn't meant to imply anything, that he was perfectly willing to draw that sword in defense of the mourner behind him.  That was the exact feeling that radiated to any aide, surgeon or well-wisher that might invade this temporary sacred ground. 

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

Early growled.

Ewell paced, his heel and peg-leg rapped in counter-time with the clock.

Hood sat like a stone, his mournful eyes locked onto something only he could see.

None dared to push past.

Behind John Walter, James Longstreet, Old Pete, sat in vigil, holding the hand of a man he loved most in this life.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

"You remember Manassas?  The first one?" Longstreet's voice was almost startling in the quiet.  It was the first time the man had spoken in hours.  John Walter had been watching the clock.  It wasn't a loud voice, barely above a whisper.  But in the silence, it shouted.

"You had to keep me from charging the Yankees.  We had whipped them something fierce and I was a young pup, hot to finish the bastards."

"But, you told me, 'James, they are beaten.  We have nothing in which to pursue them.  You will have your chance on another field, on another day.  Let them consider this loss for a few days.'"

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

The ticking seemed to change in John Walter's mind.  From a single drummer's tap, it began to take the sense of a reviewing line of the dead.  Each tick was a footstep of a dead soldier, come to escort their commander home.  Longstreet gave voice to the voiceless, but this was a review for the dead. The living could wait.

"Remember that god-awful mess at Seven Pines?  Joe Johnston had the army back then and I took the wrong damned road.  We had a chance, a real chance to end this early.  Even you said it was a good plan.  We lost over six thousand boys that day."

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

"Remember Sharpsburg?  We had our backs solid up against the Antietam Creek.  My coat had so many holes in it and our boys were dying in windrows.  I don't know how we held, but Stonewall and I held.  You asked me about my command afterwards and I remember my exact words to you, 'General, my command is able to fight again, but it is not able to retreat.'”

Longstreet shook his head.  "So much blood and only Hill coming down from Harper's Ferry saved us that day."

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

The review of the dead lasted for what felt hours, but John Walter wasn't watching the clock any longer.  He was listening to the recitation of victories and defeats.  Fredericksburg’s frozen hills, the sunken road running ankle-deep, Malvern Hill’s cannon smoke so thick men fired blind, Chancellorsville’s pine thickets burning like torches and Stonewall Jackson's ghost giving a final salute, John Walter had little doubt that if Longstreet could have named each and every dead soldier, private or officer, he would have.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

"Major?"  

Despite himself, John Walter jumped, realizing that Longstreet spoke directly to him.  He glanced at the clock.  Hours had faded and the face read almost four in the morning.  The crow of a cock welcoming the coming dawn intruded and the dead finished their escort.

"Yes Sir?"

"I believe we have an army to lead.  New orders to be issued immediately."

"Back to Virginia, sir?"

Longstreet shook his head and tucked Marse Robert's hand under the rebel gray blanket over his chest.  The vigil complete.

The generals who were sitting, thrust to their feet and began to crowd around the door as John Walter stepped back.  

"General Lee is dead?"  Ewell asked, the nervous energy turning into something more anxious, mirroring John Walter's anxiety.

Longstreet stood in the door and nodded at the gaggle of generals.  He could issue these orders himself.

"Yes."  Longstreet confirmed almost gently.  "General Ewell, you are to withdraw as quietly as possible."

"Virginia, sir?"  Early asked as if he couldn't believe it.

"No, we march north to Harrisburg.  We face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed.  General Lee wanted us to be a thorn in the side of the Yankees and, by God, we're going to turn them green with rot."
