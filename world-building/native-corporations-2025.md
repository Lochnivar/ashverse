# Corporations in Native Super-States (2025)

## The Critical Rule

Land **never** gets privatised in fee-simple European style in any of the super-states that stay sovereign.

Corporations, banks, oil companies, wind farms, casinos — all the trappings of 21st-century capitalism — are forced to **grow around** the communal/trust/clan land model instead of smashing it.

## How Each Super-State Makes It Work

| Super-State | Legal structure that replaces fee-simple ownership | How a 2025 corporation actually functions there |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | 99-year master leases + citizenship-based use rights | Google wants a data centre? It signs a 99-year lease with the Nation, pays rent in cash + jobs for citizens, builds on tribal trust land. Title never leaves the Nation. |
| **Dakota** | Tribal trust + band allotments (like OTL Alaska Native corporations) | Tesla builds a gigafactory on "band trust land." The band owns the dirt, Tesla owns the buildings and pays royalties per kilowatt produced. |
| **Comanchería** | Band-level possession + tribute system modernised into profit-sharing | Exxon drills oil wells. The local Comanche band gets 35% of every barrel as "range use fee." The band decides how to spend it (no individual titles). |
| **Navajo** | Matrilineal clan land held in perpetual trust | Amazon wants a fulfilment centre. It negotiates with the local clan corporation, pays rent + hires clan members. Clan can cancel the lease any time. |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | National trust with 199-year commercial leases | Walmart builds a super-centre on a 199-year lease. The Nation gets 8% of gross sales as rent forever. Land never leaves trust. |

## Result by 2025

- They are some of the **richest** polities in North America per capita (oil, casinos, tech leases).
- They have skyscrapers, server farms, and bullet trains.
- **No square inch of land is individually owned** by any human being or corporation in the European sense.

## The Rule

Every corporation that wants in has to play by the rules:

**You can own the bricks.  
You will never own the dirt.**

That's not resistance to modernity.

That's **modernity on indigenous terms**.

And it is 100% realistic — look at today's Alaska Native corporations, the Navajo Nation's lease system, or the way the Cherokee Nation owns every casino floor while private operators run the tables.

The super-states become 21st-century economic powers **without ever selling their soul** (or their soil).
