### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Project & Year | Why It Works for NTL Ewell | Scene That Would Break You |
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Sam Shepard** (1943-2017) | *Days of Heaven* (1978), *The Right Stuff* (1983), *Black Hawk Down* (2001) | The single best match who ever lived. Bald, hawk-faced, voice like gravel soaked in bourbon, eyes that could burn holes in steel. Shepard's Chuck Yeager is already 90% NTL Ewell: aggressive, intelligent, quietly terrified of failing the legend, and capable of terrifying competence when cornered. | The moment on the night of July 1 when he realizes Lee is dead and he has to decide whether to obey the ghost or save the army. Shepard would make you feel the exact second his soul cracks. |
| **Walton Goggins** (modern choice) | *Justified* (2010-15), *The Hateful Eight* (2015), *The Unicorn* (2019) | The best living heir to Shepard's slot. Bald head, razor cheekbones, that coiled-snake intensity that can flip from charming-to-lethal in a heartbeat. Goggins's Boyd Crowder already has the religious fervor for Lee and the tactical cunning for Longstreet's chessboard. | "We defend aggressively" delivered with that Goggins half-smile that somehow makes it sound like a death threat and a prayer at the same time. |
| **Michael Shannon** | *Boardwalk Empire* (2010-14), *Take Shelter* (2011), *Nocturnal Animals* (2016) | Towering intensity, bald option, eyes that look permanently haunted by something he can't name. Shannon's Van Alden is a man wrestling with God and losing; perfect for Ewell wrestling with Lee's ghost and finally winning. | The private July 1 ritual—Shannon silently pouring half the bourbon on the ground while staring at a portrait of Lee like he's daring the painting to speak. |
| **J.K. Simmons** (evergreen) | *Whiplash* (2014), *The Closer*, *Ozark* | Can do both terrifying aggression and sudden vulnerability. Shaved head = instant "Old Bald Head." Simmons's Fletcher would chew scenery and still make you believe he's terrified of disappointing a dead man. | The moment Longstreet gives him the defensive order and you see the exact second Ewell realizes he's about to become everything Lee hated—and that it will work. |
| **Tim Blake Nelson** (dark horse) | *O Brother*, *The Ballad of Buster Scruggs*, *Watchmen* (2019) | Underrated chameleon who can play intelligent, twitchy, dangerous, and heartbreaking in the same breath. His Buster Scruggs grin hiding despair is perfect for Ewell's dry humor over a gaping wound. | Quietly telling a staff officer "Tell General Longstreet the corps will hold… even if it kills me to do it Lee's way no more." |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key is showing his adaptation** from Lee's aggressive style to Longstreet's defensive methods, while maintaining his core intensity
- **The July 1 night scene** is critical - Ewell realizing Lee is dead and having to choose between the ghost and the army
- **The defensive order moment** - Ewell realizing he's becoming everything Lee hated, and that it will work
- **Physical presence:** Bald, intense, hawk-faced, eyes that burn - the "Old Bald Head" nickname is earned
