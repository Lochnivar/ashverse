## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**Patrick Gorman as John Bell Hood in "Gettysburg" (1993) & "Gods and Generals" (2003)**
- **Accuracy:** Core NTL fit - only major portrayal
- **Strengths:** One-eyed, arm-in-sling Hood as determined subordinate; Gorman (at 59 for Gettysburg) brings gritty resolve despite not resembling young Hood. Fans praise his "persona penetration."
- **NTL Adaptation:** Gorman's intensity for the "hold Atlanta" defiance; adapt by dropping injuries (NTL success sans wounds) for a vigorous 33-year-old charging... then digging in
- **Plausibility:** 88% - only major portrayal

### Alternative Portrayals

**Levon Helm in "In the Electric Mist" (2009)**
- **Portrayal:** Brief ghostly cameo as spectral Hood; folksy, haunted drawl in noir context
- **NTL Fit:** Niche for NTL post-war legacy - Helm's weathered charm for the "saved Atlanta" myth
- **Note:** Too cameo-like for lead; use for flashbacks
- **Archetype:** Southern everyman warrior

**Michael Fassbender (Suggested)**
- **Source:** Sheet archetype; Civil War fan forums
- **Reference:** Fassbender's fierce drive (X-Men, 12 Years a Slave) for competitive edge
- **NTL Fit:** Revelation - his smoldering eyes for the "aggressive defense" horror - chafing at walls but excelling. Young enough (at 33) for the raid-era Hood
- **Plausibility:** 85% - matches "younger Patton" vibe

**Sam Shepard (Archetype Suggestion)**
- **Source:** Sheet reference
- **Reference:** Shepard's rugged intensity (The Right Stuff) for tactical aggression
- **NTL Fit:** Fits NTL's "not just reckless" depth - stoic determination in the siege, with quiet doubts
