## Book Blurb
The fire burns across the continent. Beginning in April 1865, just after Confederate independence is recognized, the continent enters nearly three decades of transformation. The independent Confederacy struggles to maintain its economy and identity. Native American tribes consolidate into powerful sovereign super-states, reshaping the political landscape.

Through raids across borders, economic boycotts, and the suicidal arrogance of leaders like Robert Toombs, slavery dies in practice—kept alive by law but strangled by economics and international pressure. The Confederacy won the war, but it's losing the cause it fought for.

Through the eyes of the Fairfax and Meade bloodlines, and those caught in the flames, we witness a continent in transformation. The old certainties are gone, and everyone is learning to navigate a world where the rules have changed.

The fire is burning. The question is: what will be left when it's done?

## Core Plot
From April 1865 to December 1894, the new continental order is tested and reshaped. The Confederacy faces economic crises and must make difficult choices about slavery and its place in the world. Native super-states assert their sovereignty and power. The Union watches, sometimes intervenes, and sometimes steps back.

The narrative follows multiple storylines: raids across borders, economic boycotts that strangle the Confederate economy, and the role of leaders like Robert Toombs whose suicidal arrogance helps kill slavery in practice. Through economic warfare, border conflicts, and diplomatic maneuvering, slavery becomes unsustainable—dying in practice while remaining legal.

The immortal bloodlines continue to observe and sometimes intervene, their long perspectives providing insight into the patterns of history. By December 1894, slavery is dead in practice, though it remains on the books.
