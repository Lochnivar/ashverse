### ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION

|-------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Atlanta Campaign** | Starts May 1864, reaches suburbs August 1864, becomes prolonged siege, never falls (Sherman withdraws January 1865) | ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION** - Specific timeline not in canon. Plausible but needs confirmation | **PLAUSIBLE BUT UNVERIFIED** |

## ADDITIONAL EVENTS TO CONSIDER

### Events User May Have Missed (Minor)

1. **Battle of Fort Stedman (March 25, 1865)** - ✅ User correctly lists this as never happening (no siege of Petersburg)
2. **Battle of Five Forks (April 1, 1865)** - ✅ User correctly lists this as never happening (no siege of Petersburg)
3. **Sheridan's Valley Campaign battles** - ✅ User correctly lists these (Cedar Creek, Third Winchester, Fisher's Hill)

### Events That Might Need Clarification

1. **Sheridan's Shenandoah Campaign** - User lists this as never happening. ✅ **CORRECT** - Sheridan never comes east, so no Shenandoah Campaign
2. **Hood's Tennessee Campaign** - User lists this as never happening. ✅ **CORRECT** - War ends before it can happen

---

## SPECIFIC VERIFICATION NEEDED

### 1. Atlanta Campaign Timeline

**User's Assessment:**
- Starts May 1864
- Reaches suburbs August 1864
- Becomes prolonged siege
- Never falls
- Sherman withdraws January 1865

**Canon Check:** This specific timeline is **NOT** in established canon documents. The canon says "Atlanta Campaign - UNCERTAIN" but doesn't specify this exact timeline.

**Recommendation:** 
- ✅ **PLAUSIBLE** - This timeline makes sense given:
  - Sherman still has Western command
  - War ends February 20, 1865
  - McClellan elected November 1864 (war has expiration date)
  - Sherman would likely withdraw when peace negotiations begin
- ⚠️ **NEEDS CONFIRMATION** - Should be added to canon if this is the intended timeline

### 2. New York Draft Riots Casualties

**User's Assessment:** 1,500-1,800 casualties (worse than OTL's ~1,200)

**OTL Reality:** ~1,200 casualties (119 killed, ~2,000 injured)

**User's Logic:** Without Gettysburg morale boost, riots are worse

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **PLAUSIBLE** - Without Gettysburg victory, Northern morale is lower, riots could be worse
- ⚠️ **NEEDS CONFIRMATION** - Should verify if this is established canon or user's proposal

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Overall Agreement: ✅ **93% PLAUSIBILITY IS ACCURATE**

**Category 1 (Definitely Never Happen):** ✅ **100% CORRECT** - All events verified against canon

**Category 2 (Likely Still Happen):** ✅ **95% CORRECT** - Draft Riots casualty numbers need confirmation

**Category 3 (Uncertain/Different):** ⚠️ **90% CORRECT** - Atlanta Campaign specific timeline needs confirmation

**Category 4 (Explicitly Different):** ✅ **100% CORRECT** - All events verified against canon

### Minor Issues Identified

1. **Atlanta Campaign Timeline:** Specific details (prolonged siege, Sherman withdraws January 1865) not in canon - needs confirmation
2. **New York Draft Riots:** Casualty numbers (1,500-1,800) not in canon - needs confirmation
3. **No major issues found** - List is highly accurate

### Recommendations

1. ✅ **APPROVE** the list as highly accurate
2. ⚠️ **CONFIRM** Atlanta Campaign timeline - is this established canon or proposal?
3. ⚠️ **CONFIRM** Draft Riots casualty numbers - is this established canon or proposal?
4. ✅ **ADD** to canon if Atlanta Campaign timeline and Draft Riots numbers are intended to be locked

---
