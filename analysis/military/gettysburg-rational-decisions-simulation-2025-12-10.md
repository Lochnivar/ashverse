# Gettysburg Rational Decisions Simulation

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** ALTERNATIVE HISTORY SIMULATION - WHAT IF SCENARIO  
**Purpose:** Test battle simulation framework using rational decisions based on commander characteristics, rather than OTL decisions

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is an alternative history "what if" scenario. It explores what might have happened if commanders made more "rational" decisions based on their known characteristics, rather than OTL decisions that may have been influenced by other factors.

**Key Difference from OTL:** Commanders make decisions based on their known tactical preferences and rational military judgment, rather than OTL decisions that may have been influenced by pride, miscommunication, or other non-tactical factors.

## COMMANDER CHARACTERISTICS (Rational Decision Basis)

### Robert E. Lee
- **Known Traits:** Aggressive, but also tactically skilled, listens to subordinates
- **Rational Approach:** Would consider Longstreet's advice more seriously, might choose flanking movement over frontal assault
- **OTL vs. Rational:** OTL chose frontal assault despite Longstreet's objections; Rational might choose flanking movement

### James Longstreet
- **Known Traits:** Cautious, strategic thinker, prefers defensive/positional warfare, excellent at reading terrain
- **Rational Approach:** Would strongly advocate for moving around Union flank, avoiding frontal assault
- **OTL vs. Rational:** OTL followed orders despite disagreement; Rational would make stronger case, Lee might listen

### Richard Ewell
- **Known Traits:** Competent, but literal-minded, follows orders precisely
- **Rational Approach:** Would interpret "if practicable" more proactively, might attack if conditions favorable
- **OTL vs. Rational:** OTL hesitated, didn't attack; Rational might attack if conditions clearly favorable

### George Meade
- **Known Traits:** Cautious, defensive-minded, methodical
- **Rational Approach:** Would maintain strong defensive position, not take unnecessary risks
- **OTL vs. Rational:** OTL maintained defensive position (already rational); Rational similar

### Daniel Sickles
- **Known Traits:** Aggressive, independent-minded, sometimes acts without orders
- **Rational Approach:** Would follow orders, maintain position on Cemetery Ridge
- **OTL vs. Rational:** OTL advanced to Peach Orchard (controversial); Rational would stay on defensive line

## SIMULATION FRAMEWORK

### Purpose
This simulation models Gettysburg with commanders making rational decisions based on their known characteristics, rather than OTL decisions influenced by other factors.

**Key Changes from OTL:**
1. **Lee listens to Longstreet:** Considers flanking movement more seriously
2. **Ewell interprets orders proactively:** Attacks if conditions favorable
3. **Sickles follows orders:** Stays on defensive line
4. **Longstreet makes stronger case:** Advocates more forcefully for flanking movement

### Simulation Structure
- **Time Scale:** 1-2 hour turns
- **Map Scale:** Gettysburg battlefield
- **Unit Scale:** Brigade-level
- **Focus:** Rational tactical decisions based on commander characteristics

## BATTLEFIELD TERRAIN

### General Terrain Features

**Same as OTL:**
- **Cemetery Hill:** High ground, Union anchor position
- **Culp's Hill:** High ground, Union right flank
- **Little Round Top:** High ground, Union left flank
- **Seminary Ridge:** High ground, Confederate position
- **The Angle:** Union center, stone wall
- **Wheatfield:** Open ground, center
- **Devil's Den:** Rocky ground, Confederate left
- **Peach Orchard:** Open ground, center

**Key Difference:** Union maintains stronger defensive line (Sickles doesn't advance)

---

## STARTING CONDITIONS

### Union Forces: Initial Disposition

**Same as OTL:**
- **Commander:** Major General George G. Meade
- **Total Force:** ~95,000 men (by July 2)
- **Artillery:** ~370 guns

**Key Difference:** III Corps (Sickles) stays on Cemetery Ridge, doesn't advance to Peach Orchard

### Confederate Forces: Initial Disposition

**Same as OTL:**
- **Commander:** General Robert E. Lee
- **Total Force:** ~75,000 men
- **Artillery:** ~280 guns

**Key Difference:** Lee more receptive to Longstreet's advice, considers flanking movement

---

## PHASE-BY-PHASE SIMULATION (RATIONAL DECISIONS)

### PHASE 1: INITIAL CONTACT (July 1, 05:00-18:00)

**Turn 1-6: Same as OTL**
- Initial contact, Union withdrawal to Cemetery Hill
- Both sides position forces
- **Rational Decision:** Same as OTL (already rational)

**Key Difference:** None - July 1 events already reflect rational decisions

---

### PHASE 2: JULY 2 - RATIONAL DECISIONS

**Turn 7: 08:00-10:00 (2 hours) - Confederate Planning (RATIONAL)**

**Union Actions:**
- **All Corps:** Hold positions, strengthen defenses
- **III Corps (Sickles):** **STAYS ON CEMETERY RIDGE** (rational decision - follows orders)
- **Objective:** Maintain defensive line, wait for Confederate attack
- **Position:** Full fishhook line, no exposed advance

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Lee:** Considers Longstreet's advice more seriously
- **Longstreet:** Makes stronger case for flanking movement (rational - avoids frontal assault)
- **Assessment:** 60-90 minutes (Lee evaluates both options)
- **Decision:** **RATIONAL - Lee decides to try flanking movement first, keep frontal assault as backup**
- **Response:** Longstreet prepares for flanking movement, Ewell prepares for diversionary attack

**Key Difference from OTL:**
- **OTL:** Lee insists on frontal assault, Longstreet follows orders
- **Rational:** Lee considers Longstreet's advice, decides to try flanking movement

**Combat Resolution:**
- **No Major Combat:** Confederate planning
- **Result:** Lee decides on flanking movement (rational decision)

**Outcome:** ✅ Lee makes rational decision to try flanking movement, avoids costly frontal assault

---

**Turn 8: 10:00-14:00 (4 hours) - Longstreet's Flanking Movement**

**Union Actions:**
- **All Corps:** Hold positions on defensive line
- **III Corps:** **STAYS ON CEMETERY RIDGE** (rational - no exposed advance)
- **Objective:** Maintain defensive line
- **Position:** Strong defensive line, no exposed positions

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Longstreet's Corps:** Moves south, attempts to move around Union left flank
- **Assessment:** 60-90 minutes (evaluates Union positions, looks for flanking route)
- **Decision:** Move around Union left, avoid frontal assault
- **Response:** Moves south, attempts to turn Union flank

**Combat Resolution:**
- **Flanking Movement:** Longstreet moves south, Union detects movement
- **Union Response:** Meade (rational, cautious) shifts forces to cover left flank
- **Casualties:** Light (1-2% per side during movement)
- **Result:** Longstreet attempts flanking movement, but Union (rational, defensive) shifts to cover

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Union Performance:** Competent defensive response, shifts forces to cover flank
- **Confederate Performance:** Competent flanking attempt, but Union responds
- **Outcome:** Flanking movement attempted, but Union covers (rational defensive response)

**Outcome:** ⚠️ Longstreet attempts flanking movement (rational), but Union covers (rational defensive response)

---

**Turn 9: 14:00-16:00 (2 hours) - Flanking Movement Blocked**

**Union Actions:**
- **V Corps, VI Corps:** Shift to cover left flank
- **Meade:** (Rational, cautious) Strengthens left flank, maintains defensive position
- **Objective:** Prevent Confederate flanking movement
- **Position:** Extended left flank, maintains defensive line

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Longstreet:** Evaluates situation, finds Union has covered flank
- **Assessment:** 30-60 minutes (identifies Union response)
- **Decision:** **RATIONAL - Flanking movement blocked, must choose: continue trying or attack frontally**
- **Response:** Longstreet reports to Lee: "Flanking movement blocked, Union has covered left flank"

**Combat Resolution:**
- **No Major Combat:** Positioning, evaluation
- **Result:** Flanking movement blocked, Lee must decide next move

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Union Performance:** Competent defensive response, covers flank
- **Confederate Performance:** Competent flanking attempt, but blocked
- **Outcome:** Flanking movement fails (rational Union response), Lee must decide

**Outcome:** ⚠️ Flanking movement blocked (rational Union response), Lee must decide next move

---

**Turn 10: 16:00-18:00 (2 hours) - Lee's Decision Point**

**Union Actions:**
- **All Corps:** Hold positions, maintain defensive line
- **Objective:** Maintain defensive position
- **Position:** Strong defensive line, left flank covered

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Lee:** Evaluates situation: flanking movement blocked, must decide
- **Longstreet:** Recommends: "Flanking movement blocked. Options: 1) Continue trying (risky, time-consuming), 2) Attack frontally (costly, but might work), 3) Withdraw (preserves army)"
- **Assessment:** 30-60 minutes (Lee evaluates options)
- **Decision:** **RATIONAL - Lee decides: "Flanking movement blocked. Frontal assault too costly given Union position. Best option: Withdraw, preserve army, fight another day on better ground."**
- **Response:** Lee orders withdrawal, preserves army

**Combat Resolution:**
- **No Major Combat:** Confederate withdrawal begins
- **Result:** Lee makes rational decision to withdraw, avoids costly frontal assault

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Union Performance:** Competent defensive position, prevents flanking movement
- **Confederate Performance:** Rational decision to withdraw, avoids costly assault
- **Outcome:** Confederate withdraws (rational decision), Union holds position

**Outcome:** ✅ Lee makes rational decision to withdraw, avoids costly frontal assault, preserves army

---

**Alternative Scenario: What if Lee Chooses Frontal Assault Anyway?**

**If Lee chooses frontal assault (less rational, but possible):**

**Turn 10 Alternative: 16:00-18:00 (2 hours) - Frontal Assault (Less Rational)**

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Lee:** Decides on frontal assault despite Longstreet's advice
- **Decision:** "Flanking movement blocked. We attack frontally."
- **Response:** Prepares for frontal assault on Union center/left

**Combat Resolution:**
- **Frontal Assault:** Similar to OTL July 2 attacks
- **Casualties:** Heavy (5-7% Confederate, 4-6% Union)
- **Result:** Confederate attacks, but Union (stronger position, no exposed advance) holds

**Outcome:** ⚠️ Confederate attacks frontally (less rational), but Union holds (stronger position than OTL)

---

### PHASE 3: JULY 3 - RATIONAL DECISIONS (If Battle Continues)

**If battle continues to July 3 (Lee chooses frontal assault):**

**Turn 11: 08:00-13:00 (5 hours) - Artillery Duel**

**Union Actions:**
- **All Corps:** Hold positions on strong defensive line
- **Artillery:** Positions on Cemetery Ridge
- **Objective:** Maintain defensive line
- **Position:** Strong defensive line (no exposed positions)

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Artillery:** Positions on Seminary Ridge
- **Pickett's Division:** Arrives, positions for charge
- **Assessment:** 60-90 minutes (Lee evaluates, considers options)
- **Decision:** **RATIONAL - Lee evaluates: "Union position very strong. Pickett's Charge across open ground would be extremely costly. Better to withdraw."**
- **Response:** Lee decides against Pickett's Charge, orders withdrawal

**Combat Resolution:**
- **No Major Combat:** Confederate withdrawal
- **Result:** Lee makes rational decision to withdraw, avoids Pickett's Charge

**Outcome:** ✅ Lee makes rational decision to withdraw, avoids Pickett's Charge

---

**Alternative: What if Lee Chooses Pickett's Charge Anyway?**

**If Lee chooses Pickett's Charge (less rational, but possible):**

**Turn 11 Alternative: 13:00-14:00 (1 hour) - Pickett's Charge (Less Rational)**

**Union Actions:**
- **II Corps (Gibbon):** Holds center, The Angle
- **Artillery:** Continues firing
- **Objective:** Hold center, repulse Confederate charge
- **Position:** Cemetery Ridge, The Angle (stronger position than OTL - no exposed advance)

**Confederate Actions:**
- **Pickett's Division:** Charges across open ground
- **Decision:** "We attack across open ground"
- **Response:** Advances across 1,200 yards of open ground

**Combat Resolution:**
- **Pickett's Charge:** Advances across open ground under heavy fire
- **Casualties:** Very Heavy (15-20% Confederate, 3-5% Union) - exposed advance
- **Result:** Confederate advances, but Union (stronger position) repulses more effectively

**Outcome:** ❌ Confederate takes devastating casualties, Union repulses more effectively (stronger position than OTL)

- **Casualties:**
  - Union: ~18,000 (July 1-2 losses, some July 3)
  - Confederate: ~22,000 (July 1-2 losses, some July 3)
- **Result:** Union victory, Confederate takes heavy casualties (but less than OTL)

**Key Differences from OTL:**
- ⚠️ Confederate attacks frontally (less rational)
- ✅ Union holds stronger position (no exposed advance)
- ✅ Lower casualties than OTL (Union position stronger)
- ✅ No Pickett's Charge (Lee might still withdraw July 3)

---

### Scenario 3: Lee Chooses Pickett's Charge (Least Rational)

**Outcome:**
- **Confederate:** Charges across open ground, takes devastating casualties
- **Union:** Repulses charge more effectively (stronger position)
- **Casualties:**
  - Union: ~20,000 (July 1-3 losses)
  - Confederate: ~30,000 (July 1-3 losses, Pickett's Charge devastating)
- **Result:** Union victory, Confederate takes devastating casualties (similar to OTL, but Union position stronger)

**Key Differences from OTL:**
- ❌ Confederate charges (least rational)
- ✅ Union repulses more effectively (stronger position)
- ⚠️ Similar casualties to OTL (but Union position stronger)

---

## COMPARISON: OTL vs. RATIONAL DECISIONS

### OTL Results

**Union Victory:**
- Casualties: ~23,000 (24%)
- Confederate: ~28,000 (37%)
- Key: Sickles advances to Peach Orchard (exposed), Pickett's Charge

**Confederate Performance:**
- Attacks frontally despite Longstreet's advice
- Pickett's Charge across open ground
- Heavy casualties, army weakened

---

### Rational Decisions Results

**Most Rational Scenario (Lee Withdraws):**
- Union Casualties: ~12,000 (13%) - **Lower than OTL**
- Confederate Casualties: ~8,000 (11%) - **Much lower than OTL**
- Key: Lee withdraws after flanking movement blocked, preserves army

**Key Differences:**
- ✅ Confederate avoids costly frontal assaults
- ✅ Army preserved (strategic victory despite tactical defeat)
- ✅ Union still wins (defensive position too strong)
- ✅ Lower casualties on both sides
