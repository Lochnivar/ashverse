# California Diplomacy and Realpolitik

## The Motto

**Republic of California, 1925–2025**  
**Motto on every government building (in English and Cantonese):**  
**"We don't care who was right.  
We care who's still rich."**

## The Triad in 2025

| The Triad in 2025 | Self-image | Reality check |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|
| **United States (East)** | "Arsenal of Democracy, moral beacon, etc." | Broke, nostalgic, still arguing about 1865 |
| **Confederate States** | "We buried the past, we're civilised now, really." | One bad harvest from someone quoting Toombs again |
| **Republic of California** | **"We're the adults in the room. You two keep fighting over ghosts. We'll be over here making money."** | Actually running the continent's only functional navy, ports, and tech economy |

## California's Self-Interest

California doesn't **intend** to be the continent's sugar daddy. It just turns out that **what's good for California is usually good enough for the other two**… and California is perfectly happy to let them pretend it's charity.

| California's self-interest | How it accidentally (or "accidentally") benefits the triad | Why the other two swallow it |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Builds the biggest, shiniest Pacific fleet | Keeps Japan from ever thinking about a West-Coast raid | U.S. and CSA get free protection without paying for the ships |
| Cuts oil deals with anyone who pays | Guarantees fuel supply to the entire continent in wartime | U.S. and CSA grumble about price-gouging but never run dry |
| Hosts the triennial "American Concord" summit in Monterey with perfect weather and perfect catering | Forces the U.S. and CSA presidents to sit at the same table without shooting each other | They get to look like statesmen on California's dime |
| Quietly bankrolls joint naval bases in Guam, Hawaii, and Panama | Creates a **de-facto** North-American defensive ring around the Pacific | U.S. and CSA get bases they couldn't afford alone |

## California's Internal Motto

**"We win when the continent wins.  
We just win a little more."**

The U.S. and CSA grumble, but they keep cashing the cheques because the alternative is doing it themselves and they're still too busy yelling about 1861.

## The Voice

The California vibe is **not** how they talk. It's how they **think** and **act**.

| What the world sees (external) | What California is actually doing (internal) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Calm, slightly amused, never raises its voice | Has already calculated every leverage point and is three moves ahead |
| "We're all in this together" | Means: "We'll pay, you'll shut up, and we'll run the show" |
| "Let's not get emotional" | Means: "Your moral outrage is irrelevant to our bottom line" |
| "Happy to help" | Means: "We're buying influence at a 70% discount" |
| Refuses to take sides in U.S.–CSA squabbles | Means: "We're the only adult on the continent, and we'll remind you when it costs you" |

The voice is **perfectly polished, board-room coastal elite** (think 1980s–2020s San Francisco–LA power-speak): clear diction, light smile, zero regional accent, sentences that sound like they were written by a lawyer who just finished yoga.

But the **mindset** underneath is pure surf:
- "Why fight the wave when you can ride it?"
- "The ocean doesn't care who's right, it just keeps moving."
- "Chill. We'll still be here when the tide goes out."

No "dude."  
No "brah."  
No "gnarly."

Just the quiet, unshakable confidence of the guy who owns the beach and knows everyone else is renting.

## California Diplomacy

**Boardroom voice, riptide mind.**

California doesn't rule North America.

It just **charges admission to peace**.

And everyone pays because the alternative is worse.

## The Continental Decompression Chamber

California is **not** a tense neutral zone where the U.S. and CSA presidents sit across a table glaring at each other.

It is the **continental decompression chamber**.

The place where the temperature drops ten degrees the moment you step off the plane, where the wine is cold, the view is perfect, and everyone suddenly remembers there is a **much bigger world** outside their 1861 grudge match.

California doesn't force them to like each other.

It just makes it **embarrassing** to act like children when the adults (Beijing, Tokyo, London, Berlin) are watching.

That's not neutrality.

That's **enlightened self-interest with perfect weather**.
