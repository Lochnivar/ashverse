# Fairfax Land Ownership in Sequoyah

## The Critical Rule

**The Fairfaxes never own the dirt in fee-simple European style.**

Real 1865–1894 Sequoyah (Cherokee Nation West + unified Five Tribes republic) is **not** Oklahoma with a different flag.

It is a **communal, clan-based, citizenship-driven polity** where:

- Land is held in **tribal trust** or clan allotment
- **Citizenship**, not cash, determines who can use land
- Outsiders (even adopted whites) do **not** get fee-simple title
- Grazing, farming, and timber rights are allocated by **citizen councils**, not deeds

A white ex-Confederate planter walking in with Virginia money and expecting to buy 2,000 acres outright gets laughed out of the council house, or worse.

## Realistic Fairfax Land Options

| Option | How it actually works (1865–1894) | Realism score |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Intermarriage + citizenship** | Thomas marries into a prominent Cherokee/Creek family (or Samantha does). The Fairfaxes become **citizens**. They are granted use-rights to a large tract, but it is **tribal land** held in trust. | 10/10 – this is how whites got big holdings OTL (e.g., Ridge, Ross, Vann families). |
| **Lease from the Nation** | Sequoyah government leases large blocks to white investors for 25–99 years at peppercorn rent in exchange for development (schools, mills, railroads). Fairfaxes "own" improvements, not the soil. | 9/10 – mirrors real Cherokee leasing OTL 1880s–90s. |
| **Buy improved land from a citizen** | A Cherokee citizen who already has possession sells the **improvements** (house, fences, orchard). The land itself stays tribal. | 9/10 – common loophole OTL. |
| **Straight-up fee-simple purchase** | **Impossible** without citizenship reform (which doesn't happen until Dawes-era equivalent, 1890s or later). | 1/10 – this is the European delusion. |

## Narrative Consequence

The Fairfax "plantation" in Hoyt is **never** theirs the way Virginia was.

It is:
- leased from the Nation, or
- held through Samantha's (or a child's) Cherokee citizenship, or
- a giant improvement contract on tribal land

They can be rich.  
They can be influential.  
They can build a big house with a porch.

But the land **does not belong to them** in the European sense.

And every Sequoyah citizen reminds them of that fact every single year at council time.

## Realistic Sequoyah Land-Use Rules (1865–1894)

| Rule | What it means for the Fairfaxes in practice | Narrative pain |
|------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Open range / free passage** | Any Sequoyah citizen (or permitted traveller) can drive cattle, hunt, or camp on your "improvement" land without asking. | Fairfax cattle get mixed with Cherokee herds. Fences get torn down the same week they go up. |
| **No individual fee-simple title** | When Thomas dies, the land does **not** automatically pass to his children unless they are enrolled citizens. | The family has to keep marrying Cherokee or re-apply every generation. |
| **Tribal tax on improvements** | Every barn, house, or orchard is taxed annually by the National Council. Fail to pay → improvements revert to the Nation. | The big house on the hill can be taken away by vote. |
| **Clan veto rights** | The local clan that originally controlled the tract can revoke or reduce use rights if the Fairfaxes "abuse" the land (e.g., enslave again, overgraze, sell timber). | One bad season or one political enemy and the family is homeless. |
| **Freedmen settlement preference** | Escaped slaves who reach Sequoyah and take citizenship get **first dibs** on any surplus land in the district. | The Fairfax "plantation" keeps shrinking as new black citizens are granted plots carved out of it. |

## Resulting Fairfax Reality in Hoyt, 1867–1894

- The house is big, the porch is famous, the family is rich by local standards.
- But half the cattle on the place technically belong to Cherokee neighbours.
- Every spring the council sends a delegation to count the orchards and assess the tax.
- Every time a new group of freedmen arrives from Arkansas, another 100 acres disappears into new allotments.
- The Fairfaxes are **permanently one council vote away** from losing everything they built.

That's not European plantation ownership.

That's **hostage-guest status** on land that was never theirs and never will be.

The Fairfaxes are the richest family in the district who still have to ask permission to plant a peach tree and watch their "estate" shrink every time a runaway knocks on the door.
