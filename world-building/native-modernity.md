# Native Super-States and Modernity

## The Critical Rule

**Every sovereign Native nation that survives into the 20th–21st century does exactly one thing: it keeps the core of its identity while ruthlessly stealing every tool modernity offers that makes it stronger.**

They do **not** "resist modernity" for its own sake.  
They resist **being absorbed by it**.

That's a huge difference.

## Tradition vs. Modernity

| Tradition they keep | Modernity they adopt (instantly and without apology) |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Language in council, prayers, kinship rules | Railroads, telegraphs, repeating rifles, oil wells, electricity, pickup trucks, satellite TV |
| Clan / band decision-making | Written constitutions, courts, tax codes, corporations |
| Sacred regalia for ceremonies | Western suits for daily governance, jeans for work, designer sunglasses because they look cool |

## Real-World Examples

- Cherokee Nation 2025: council opens with stomp dance and cedar smoke, then they put on suits and vote on a $3 billion casino budget.
- Navajo Nation: sheep camp in the canyon, but the shepherd has a smartphone with GPS and a satellite dish outside the hogan.
- Lakota: Sun Dance in July, then everyone drives home in a new Dodge Ram with a "Oyate" licence plate.

## The Super-States in the NTL

They never freeze in 1860.

They **weaponise** tradition inside a shell of modernity.

By 2025 a Sequoyah delegate:
- wears a tailored three-piece suit and Allen Edmonds boots
- has a silver concho belt and a single eagle feather in his lapel
- opens his laptop that has a Medicine Wheel sticker
- speaks fluent English and fluent Cherokee
- votes on a $400 million wind-farm deal
- then goes home to a house with solar panels and a sweat lodge in the backyard

That's not "resistance to modernity".

That's **mastery of modernity on their own terms**.

## The Philosophy

Tradition is the **software**.

Modernity is the **hardware**.

They upgrade the hardware every chance they get and never let anyone else write the code.

That's how real sovereign indigenous nations survive.
