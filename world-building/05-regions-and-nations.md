## I. NATIVE SUPER-STATES

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

### Overview & Recognition

| Polity | Territory (1865 borders) | Status 1865–1894 | Realism check & loopholes |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | All of modern Oklahoma + chunks of north Texas & SE Kansas | Sovereign republic (treaty-guaranteed). One of the Five Civilized Tribes' successor states. Becomes the **refuge** for escaped slaves and the Fairfax "heart." | 9/10 – plausible. The Five Tribes were already negotiating statehood OTL; NTL peace treaty locks it in. |
| **Dakota** | Most of modern North & South Dakota + eastern Montana | Sovereign Lakota-led confederacy (treaty-protected). Never broken by U.S. expansion. | 8/10 – requires stronger 1860s treaties, but possible with distracted U.S. |
| **Comanchería** | Texas Panhandle + western Oklahoma + eastern New Mexico | Recognized Comanche-Kiowa-Apache dominion. Raiding buffer state. | 7/10 – Comanche were still dominant in 1860s; treaty freezes them in place. |
| **Navajo Nation** | Four Corners region (larger than OTL) | Sovereign, sheep-based economy, U.S./CSA trade partner. | 9/10 – already semi-autonomous; treaty just formalises it. |
| **Cherokee Outlet State** | Northern strip of modern Oklahoma | Separate Cherokee republic carved out of the Outlet lands. | 8/10 – internal Cherokee politics make this believable. |

### Key Realism Pillars

1. **1865 Treaty of Cincinnati** explicitly recognises all pre-war Indian Territory treaties and adds new sovereignty guarantees to keep Native nations as buffers between U.S. and CSA.
2. **Both American republics are too exhausted and broke** post-war to restart Indian removal.
3. **Railroads and settlement are delayed** by the divided continent — no trans-continental push until the 1880s–90s.
4. **Sequoyah in particular** becomes the **safety valve** for escaped slaves and dissidents, giving it economic and moral leverage.

### Embattled Survivors (Not Super-Powers)

**The Critical Reclassification:**
The Native super-states are **not** super-powers. They are **embattled survivors** who maintain sovereignty through:

1. **Strategic buffer position** between USA and CSA
2. **Mutual exhaustion** of both American republics (neither can afford another war)
3. **Treaty guarantees** locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (1865)
4. **Constant vigilance** and diplomatic skill
5. **Economic necessity** (both USA and CSA need trade routes through Native territory)

**The Reality (1865-1939):**

| Aspect | Super-Power Myth | Embattled Survivor Reality |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Military Strength** | Dominant armies | Small, well-trained forces that can defend but not project power |
| **Economic Power** | Industrial giants | Resource-based economies, dependent on trade with USA/CSA/California |
| **Political Influence** | Continental dominance | Buffer states that survive because both sides need them as neutral ground |
| **Territorial Control** | Expanding empires | Defending existing borders, no expansion possible |
| **Diplomatic Status** | Equal partners | Respected but always vulnerable to changing circumstances |

### Consolidation Process

**95% of the consolidation is done in one pen stroke on 31 March 1865** because both exhausted American republics need the Native nations as a permanent buffer and are willing to pay with sovereignty to get it.

**How Each Super-State Becomes Sovereign:**

| Super-State | How It Becomes Sovereign (Exact Mechanism) | Timeline |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Sequoyah** | Article 4 of the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 Mar 1865) explicitly recognises the united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Dakota (Lakota Confederacy)** | Same treaty – U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Comanchería** | Treaty Article 5 – "the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognised as a single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Navajo (Diné)** | Treaty Article 6 – 1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | Separate 1866 side-agreement between Sequoyah and the U.S./CSA – Outlet stripped from Kansas and given to Cherokee Nation as sovereign territory. | 1866 |

**Later Consolidation (Only Window Dressing):**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **1871** | Council of the Four Roads first meets (rotating host cities). |
| **1889** | Permanent council charter signed – still no central government, just arbitration and mutual defence. |
| **1919** | Formal "Confederated Indigenous Nations" customs union (trade only). |

### Sequoyah: The Slave Refuge

**Sequoyah becomes the **refuge** for escaped slaves and dissidents, giving it economic and moral leverage.**

- **Role:** Primary destination for escaped slaves from CSA
- **Economic Impact:** Freedmen contribute to Sequoyah's economy
- **Moral Leverage:** Sequoyah uses its role as refuge in diplomatic negotiations
- **Fairfax Connection:** The Fairfax "heart" - family connections and relationships

## II. MORMON DESERET: THE MORMON VENICE

### **LOCKED CANON - Plausibility: 75%**

**Official Framing:** Deseret is the **Mormon Venice of North America** – a pious theocratic republic that survives by banking for infidels, charging fair interest, and proving that God helps those who help themselves… especially when they keep perfect ledgers and maintain armed neutrality.

**Previous analogies (Switzerland/Cayman Islands) are hereby retired.**  
**Deseret is now and forever the Mormon Venice.**

### Core Characteristics (All Locked)

| Feature | Detail | Historical Parallel |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Religious Oversight** | Every transaction blessed and recorded in triplicate | Venetian bankers operating under Church scrutiny |
| **Absolute Honesty** | Lying about money = theological damnation | Venetian reputation for scrupulous bookkeeping |
| **No Speculation** | Debt aversion; no derivatives or complex instruments | Venice banned most forms of speculative finance |
| **Neutral Arbiter** | Escrow for treaties, trade deals, Concord deposits | Venice as banker to Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim powers |
| **Armed Neutrality** | Mountain fortress + militia | Venetian lagoon + Arsenal |
| **Commodity Wealth** | Utah/Nevada silver, copper, gold | Venetian control of salt, spices, silk routes |
| **Pious Hypocrisy** | "We serve God by serving Mammon honestly" | Venice's religious processions while banking for the Sultan |

### Key Timeline Beats (Locked)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **1865** | Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7 recognises Deseret sovereignty ("Leave us alone…") |
| **1880** | First informal banking begins – escrow for cotton bonds during boycott |
| **1892** | "Timber Dispute" – first major tri-national escrow |
| **1909** | Appomattox College partly funded by Deseret "neutral contribution" |
| **1919** | American Concord Treaty deposits physically held in Salt Lake City vaults |
| **1929-1939** | Only major banking system that does not collapse during the Depression |

### The Evolution (1865-1939)

**Phase 1: Survival (1865-1877)**
- **Status:** Sovereign theocracy, recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7
- **Economic Role:** Minimal - survival mode, self-sufficiency
- **Key:** Brigham Young's 15,000 armed men deter any invasion
- **Reality:** Both USA and CSA too exhausted to fight another Mormon War

**Phase 2: Banking Emergence (1877-1890)**
- **Status:** Succession crisis after Brigham Young's death
- **Economic Role:** Banking begins to emerge as neutral ground
- **1880:** First informal banking begins – escrow for cotton bonds during boycott
- **Key:** Deseret banks become safe haven for capital flight from USA and CSA
- **Reality:** Religious discipline creates stable, predictable banking system

**Phase 3: The Mormon Venice (1890-1920)**
- **Status:** Banking neutrality established, "Mormon Venice" reputation solidified
- **1892:** "Timber Dispute" – first major tri-national escrow
- **Economic Role:** **Indispensable** - all three republics depend on Deseret banks
- **Key:** Mining wealth (silver, gold, copper) provides economic foundation
- **Reality:** Deseret becomes too economically important to attack
- **1909:** Appomattox College partly funded by Deseret "neutral contribution"

**Phase 4: Continental Financial Hub (1920-1939)**
- **Status:** Rich, weird, heavily armed theocracy that everyone trades with but nobody trusts
- **1919:** American Concord Treaty deposits physically held in Salt Lake City vaults
- **Economic Role:** Central banking hub for entire continent
- **Key:** Neutral broker for USA-CSA-California financial transactions
- **1929-1939:** Only major banking system that does not collapse during the Depression
- **Reality:** Economic interdependence makes Deseret untouchable

### Why Banking Neutrality Works

- **Religious Discipline:** Lying about money = theological damnation
- **Perfect Ledgers:** Every transaction blessed and recorded in triplicate
- **No Speculation:** Debt aversion; no derivatives or complex instruments
- **Neutral Arbiter:** Escrow for treaties, trade deals, Concord deposits
- **Armed Neutrality:** Mountain fortress + militia = untouchable
- **Economic Necessity:** All three republics depend on Deseret banks

## III. CALIFORNIA: INDEPENDENCE AND PACIFIC EMPIRE

### **LOCKED CANON - Core Facts**

**Independence Timeline (1872-1873):**
- Great Native Toll War: Jan–May 1872
- Independence Referendum: 5 Nov 1872 (69% YES)
- Treaty of San Francisco signed: 14 Feb 1873
- Republic of California fully sovereign: 4 July 1873

**Capital:** San Francisco (proclaimed 4 July 1873)  
**Treaty Name:** "Treaty of San Francisco" (standardized across all documents)

### The Geographic Reality (1865)

California in 1865 is already a U.S. state (admitted 1850), overwhelmingly Union-loyal, but **physically cut off** from the rest of the United States by:

- **Sovereign Native super-states** (Dakota, Comanchería, etc.) in the Great Plains
- **The CSA** controlling everything from Arkansas/Texas westward to the Colorado River in some places
- **Mormon Deseret republic** blocking the northern route

**There is no land bridge left.**

### Timeline of California's Evolution

**1865–1870: De-facto U.S. Exclave**
- **Political status:** De-facto **U.S. exclave**
- **How it survives:** Connected only by sea (Panama railway still tiny). Federal troops and navy keep it loyal.
- **Realism check:** 10/10

**1870–1872: Growing De-facto Independence**
- **Political status:** Growing **de-facto independence**
- **What happens:** Transcontinental railroad is **never built** (or built much later and under joint U.S./Native control). California starts acting like a separate country in practice.
- **Realism check:** 9/10

**January–May 1872: Great Native Toll War**
- **Trigger:** Native super-states triple railroad tolls → California trade strangled
- **Result:** California realizes it cannot depend on land routes controlled by Native nations

**5 November 1872: California Independence Referendum**
- **Result:** 69% vote YES
- **The Logic:** "Well if they can do it, so can we" - CSA seceded and won. California can do the same.
- **Why it works:** The US has no moral foundation (just recognized CSA secession) and no military might (no army within 1,500 miles, exhausted from war). The North has no political will for another civil war and needs California's ports for trade.

**14 February 1873: Treaty of San Francisco Signed**
- **Event:** Peaceful secession formalised
- **Terms:** California leaves the Union peacefully. U.S. keeps military bases under 99-year lease (San Diego, Mare Island, Presidio of San Francisco).
- **The vibe:** Amicable divorce. Both sides shake hands and get rich together.

**4 July 1873: Republic of California Fully Sovereign**
- **Event:** Independence Day chosen deliberately
- **Status:** Fully independent **Republic of California**
- **First President:** Leland Stanford elected AFTER independence (first president of the new republic, takes office July 4, 1873 or shortly after)
- **Key Point:** Stanford's presidency (1873-1879) begins AFTER California becomes independent, not before

**1873–2025: Independent Republic**
- **Political status:** Fully independent Republic of California
- **Characteristics:** Rich, neutral, Singapore-with-redwoods, speaks English with a Spanish accent
- **Relationship with U.S.:** Like post-independence Ireland treats Britain — family, but not the same house
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### Why the North Lets It Happen Without Firing a Shot

**The "Well If They Can Do It, So Can We" Dynamic:**

California's secession is fundamentally a **"Well if they can do it, so can we"** divorce. The CSA already proved secession is legal when you win. California just does it **cleaner** and **more peacefully**.

**The US Lacks Both Moral Foundation and Military Might:**

1. **No Moral Foundation:**
   - The US just lost a war trying to prevent CSA secession
   - Can't claim secession is illegal when you just signed a treaty recognizing CSA independence
   - "If secession was wrong, why did we sign the Treaty of Cincinnati?"
   - California's logic: "You recognized the CSA. You can't deny us the same right."

2. **No Military Might:**
   - **Geography** – no land corridor, no way to march an army there (1,500+ miles away)
   - **Exhaustion** – just lost a 4-year war, no army within 1,500 miles of California
   - **Money** – California is already bankrolling half the remaining U.S. debt with gold/oil/port fees. War would bankrupt the North instantly.
   - **Public opinion** – after the 1861–65 bloodbath, no Northerner wants to die for "keeping the Pacific coast in the Union."

**The Result:**
The US has neither the moral authority nor the military capability to force California to stay. California secedes because it can, and the US lets it because it must.

### Oregon and Washington: California's Strategic Investment

**Important:** California does **not** take Oregon and Washington with it when it leaves (1873), but California aggressively lobbies (bribes) them to prevent US statehood or cause secession.

**California's Strategic Fear:**
The fundamental concern: Oregon and Washington represent a potential US beachhead if the United States ever decides to violate the 1873 secession treaty. By preventing statehood or causing secession, California removes the ability for the U.S. to establish a foothold on Pacific shores without California's knowledge and consent.

**California's Investment (1873-1907):**
- **Total investment:** ~$1.8 billion (2025-equivalent dollars) in direct grants, loans at preferential rates, and infrastructure equity to secure Oregon/Washington's accession to Pacific Alliance.
- **Mechanism:** California prevents them from becoming US states through economic pressure, bribes, and strategic investment

### The Pacific Alliance / Cascadia Compact

**1894 – Pacific Economic Conference in Portland:**
- **Event:** Oregon, Washington Territory, and the Republic of California sign the **Portland Articles**
- **Terms:** Free trade zone between all three, mutual defense of Pacific commerce, joint naval stations (Bremerton, Mare Island, Esquimault), annual rotating summit (Portland, San Francisco, Seattle)
- **Status:** Loose economic/defense cooperation. Not yet a formal alliance.

**1907 – Treaty of Astoria:**
- **Date of Entry into Force:** 1 September 1907
- **Event:** Washington (now a state) formally joins. The **Pacific Alliance** is born.
- **Legal Status:** The States of Oregon and Washington remain constituent states of the United States, simultaneously become full founding members of the Pacific Alliance, delegated authority in matters of trade, navigation, and Pacific defense
- **Formal Structure:** On paper: three equal sovereigns (California independent, Oregon/Washington as U.S. states with delegated powers). In practice: California writes 60% of the budget, stations 70% of the ships, and hosts the summit whenever it feels like reminding everyone who's paying for the champagne

**The Reality:**
- California pays 60% of the budget
- California stations 70% of the ships
- California hosts the summit whenever it wants (despite "rotating" on paper)
- Oregon and Washington keep their rainy, stubborn, lumber-and-salmon identity
- They just do it under a navy that flies the Bear Flag

### California's Realpolitik Philosophy (1873-1939)

**Core Principle:** "We don't care who was right. We care who's still rich."

**Characteristics:**
- Pragmatic, not moralistic
- Trade-first, Asia-first, "the ocean is our front yard"
- Neutral when possible, interventionist when profitable
- "The adult in the room" - mediates between USA and CSA
- Younger sibling role - "We don't care who was right. We care who's still rich."

### California-Japan Relationship

**1895-1939: Pacific Understanding**
- **1895:** Japan-California trade agreement signed
- **Key:** California provides oil, Japan provides markets
- **Relationship:** Mutual respect, strategic partnership
- **California's Role:** Neutral broker, trade partner, oil supplier

**1956: Tourist Board**
- **Event:** California-Japan Tourist Board established
- **Purpose:** Cultural exchange, tourism promotion
- **Significance:** Post-war normalization, economic cooperation

### California Oil Economics (1873-1939)

**The Long Game Strategy:**
- **1873:** California discovers oil reserves
- **Strategy:** Control production, set prices, become indispensable
- **Result:** By 1939, California controls Pacific oil markets
- **Impact:** All three republics depend on California oil

**Economic Impact:**
- California becomes richest republic on continent
- Oil revenue funds Pacific navy, infrastructure, trade
- California uses oil as leverage in diplomatic negotiations

### Alaska Purchase (1875-1876)

**1875:** USA attempts to purchase Alaska from Russia
- **USA Strategy:** Blockade Russian ports, force sale
- **Result:** USA blockade fails (1875)
- **Reinforces:** Post-war USA weakness, inability to project power

**1876:** California purchases Alaska (or assists in purchase)
- **California Role:** Provides financing, naval support
- **Result:** Alaska becomes California territory (or joint USA-California territory)
- **Significance:** California extends Pacific influence northward

### California as Council Arbiter

**Role:** California acts as neutral arbiter in Native super-state disputes
- **Mechanism:** California mediates conflicts between Native nations
- **Leverage:** Economic power, trade relationships, neutrality
- **Result:** California becomes indispensable for Native diplomacy

## IV. BORDER REGIONS

### US-CSA Border Regions

**Post-1865 Border:**
- **Kentucky:** Remains USA (border state, never seceded)
- **Missouri:** Remains USA (border state, never seceded)
- **West Virginia:** Remains USA (LOCKED CANON - seceded from Virginia during war, stays USA)
- **Border Tensions:** Constant disputes, trade issues, occasional incidents
- **1927 Kentucky Neutral Zone Crisis:** Worst incident - 38 dead, both presidents call California within 48 hours

**The Reality:**
- Hard border, but economic interdependence
- No shooting wars after 1865
- All conflict is economic, diplomatic, legal, or spectacularly passive-aggressive

### West Virginia: Treaty Correction

**LOCKED CANON:** West Virginia **stays USA** (seceded from Virginia during war, stays USA after peace)

**Status:** LOCKED - No changes allowed

## V. COUNCIL EVOLUTION

### Council of the Four Roads

**1871:** Council of the Four Roads first meets (rotating host cities)

**1889:** Permanent council charter signed – still no central government, just arbitration and mutual defence

**1919:** Formal "Confederated Indigenous Nations" customs union (trade only)

**Structure:**
- Loose confederation, not a unified state
- Rotating leadership
- California arbitration
- Mutual defense pacts

**Role:**
- Coordinates Native super-state diplomacy
- Provides mutual defense
- Facilitates trade between Native nations
- Maintains buffer function between USA and CSA
