## SECTION 1: ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS OVERVIEW (1865-2025)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Money flows freely.

Borders are hard.

Everyone is rich.

Nobody is in charge.

That's the economic reality of the continent from 1905 onward.

California prints the cheques.

The Native nations own the roads.

U.S. and CSA spend the money  
and pretend they're still superpowers.

### The Economic Features

| Feature | What Actually Happens (1865–2025) | Realism Check |
|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **No shared currency** | U.S. dollar, Confederate dollar, and separate tribal currencies (Sequoyah silver dollar, Dakota trade beads, Comanchería cattle notes, etc.). All convertible at fixed rates in border banks. | 10/10 |
| **Trade agreements** | Triad Free-Trade Zone (U.S., CSA, California) from 1905 onward. Native super-states have permanent most-favoured-nation status but negotiate as sovereign blocs. | 9/10 |
| **Tariffs** | 1865–1905: punitive Northern tariffs on CSA slave-grown goods. 1905–2025: zero internal tariffs between U.S., CSA, California. Native super-states charge export duties on raw materials (oil, beef, timber) but zero import duties. | 10/10 |
| **Trade wars** | 1865–1905: cold trade war (boycott era). 1905–2025: occasional flare-ups (e.g., 1930s U.S. tries to tax California oil, gets slapped down). | 10/10 |
| **Special Native economic weapon** | Every super-state can shut its borders to either U.S. or CSA traffic at will. The trans-continental railroads all cross Native land → instant stranglehold if anyone misbehaves. | 10/10 – this is why no one invades them |

### Realistic 2025 Economic Map

| Bloc | Currency | GDP Rank (2025) | Economic Vibe |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Republic of California** | California dollar (pegged to gold) | 1 | Pacific tech/oil/entertainment empire |
| **United States (East)** | U.S. dollar (fiat) | 2 | Industrial heartland, rusting in places |
| **Confederate States** | Confederate dollar (silver-backed) | 3 | Oil, cotton, manufacturing, still proud |
| **Native super-states (collective)** | Mixed tribal currencies | 4 (combined) | Resource billionaires who own the continent's arteries |

## SECTION 2: GLOBAL COTTON GLUT (1880-1894)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The global cotton glut is 90% India + Egypt doing what they did OTL  
and 10% everything else.

No synthetics needed.  
No magic reduced demand.  
Just the same flood that almost killed slavery in Brazil OTL  
hitting the CSA ten years earlier  
because the raids and boycott kept them from ever regaining market share.

### Factor Breakdown

| Factor | Contribution to Glut (1880–1894) | Realism Check |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| **India & Egypt production surge** | 85–90% | 10/10 – OTL Egypt + India flooded the market 1865–1890 because of the American Civil War vacuum. In NTL the CSA never regains its pre-war share. |
| **Reduced European demand** | 5–8% | 7/10 – possible from 1890s depression, but not the main driver |
| **Synthetic alternatives** | 0% | 0/10 – rayon is 1910+, nylon 1935+ |
| **Other** | 2–5% (weather, transport improvements) | Minor |

### Realistic Locked Timeline of the Glut

| Year | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **1865–1875** | India/Egypt already at war-time peak. CSA tries to rebuild but raids + boycott keep output low. |
| **1875–1885** | British investment in Egyptian irrigation + Indian rail network → massive surplus. |
| **1886–1890** | Global cotton prices crash 40–50% (OTL numbers – even worse in NTL because CSA can't compete). |
| **1890–1894** | CSA planters drowning in unsold bales → final desperation → last hold-out states capitulate. |

## SECTION 3: GLOBAL BOYCOTT TRIGGER

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The global boycott is not organic outrage alone.

It is Britain weaponising abolition the moment the CSA hands them the perfect casus belli.

The Toombs Act lights the fuse.

The photographs are the explosion.

The Royal Navy is the hammer.

That's the sequence.

### The Triggers

| Trigger | Role in the Boycott | Realism Check |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **1. The Toombs Act itself (Dec 1867)** | The legal spark – the moment the CSA publicly re-opens the African trade | 10/10 – Britain has been waiting for this exact excuse since 1861 |
| **2. First slave ships dock publicly (Mar–Jul 1868)** | The moral detonator – photos of chained Africans on Charleston wharves printed in London papers | 10/10 – identical to OTL Brazil 1880s outrage |
| **3. British abolitionist societies** | Immediate coordinated campaign – petitions, sermons, dock-worker strikes in Liverpool/Manchester | 10/10 – same networks that killed the trade OTL |
| **4. British government action (Aug 1868)** | Royal Navy declared "anti-slavery patrol" – any ship touching a CSA port is stopped and searched | 10/10 – they did this to Brazil 1850 |
| **5. France + smaller powers follow** | Within 60 days – full diplomatic rupture and trade boycott | 9/10 |
| **6. Cotton glut (1880s)** | Secondary amplifier – makes the boycott hurt more, but is not the trigger | 8/10 |

### Exact Trigger Moment

**4 July 1868** – the slave ship **Wildfire II** docks in Charleston with 720 Africans.

**Photographs are in London papers by 28 July.**

**British cabinet votes boycott 12 August.**

**First Royal Navy frigate appears off Charleston 1 September 1868.**

Everything after that is follow-on pain.

## SECTION 4: PUNITIVE TARIFFS (1868-1905)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The punitive tariffs are a clear, deliberate Northern violation of Article 8 — and that's exactly why the North can only get away with it for as long as the Toombs Act is in force.

The North does violate Article 8.

The violation is universally condemned as illegal in CSA rhetoric.

The violation is universally accepted as necessary by every other country that hates slavery.

The CSA is powerless to stop it.

### Official U.S. Diplomatic Note (15 April 1868)

**Official U.S. diplomatic note to the CSA, 15 April 1868 (public, printed in every Northern paper):**

"The Government of the United States signed the Treaty of Cincinnati in the good-faith belief that both parties intended to conduct themselves as civilised nations.

The Confederate Congress, by its Act of 19 December 1867, has chosen to resume the African slave trade — an institution universally recognised as an offence against humanity.

Under these circumstances, the United States cannot consider itself bound by the letter of Article 8 while the Confederate States persist in a course that violates the treaty's fundamental moral premise.

Accordingly, protective duties will be applied to all goods of Confederate origin until such time as the African Labour Restoration Act is repealed and the practice ceases."

**In plain English:**

"You broke the spirit so badly  
that we're no longer bound by the letter."

### The Timeline

| Year | Legal Reality | How Both Sides Justify It (And Why the North Wins) |
|------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **1868** | Toombs Act re-opens African slave trade | North immediately declares the Act "a fundamental breach of the moral foundation on which the Treaty was signed." |
| **15 April 1868** | Official U.S. diplomatic note declares Article 8 suspended | "You broke the spirit so badly that we're no longer bound by the letter." |
| **1868–69** | U.S. Congress passes Punitive Tariff Act of 1868 (300% on all CSA goods not certified free-labour) | North's legal argument (public and private): "Article 8 assumes both parties are civilised nations. A state that re-opening the African trade has forfeited that status. The tariff is therefore not 'discriminatory' – it is defensive." |
| **1869–1871** | CSA screams "treaty violation!" in every diplomatic note | North's reply: "Restore the 1808 constitutional ban on the African trade and the tariffs disappear tomorrow." |
| **1871–1905** | Stalemate. Tariffs stay in place. | North never formally withdraws from Article 8; it just suspends it unilaterally while slavery/African trade exists. The CSA can't force compliance because it has no navy and the rest of the world backs the North. |

## SECTION 5: CURRENCIES IN NTL

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

### The Three Currencies

| Republic | Currency (Official Name) | Backing (1865–1933) | Backing (1933–1939) | Nickname in 2025 |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **United States (East)** | United States dollar (USD) | Gold (100% until 1933) | Gold + silver (bimetallic after 1933 crash) | "Greenback" |
| **Confederate States** | Confederate dollar (CSD) | Gold + silver (bimetallic from day one) | Same, but heavier silver content | "Grayback" |
| **Republic of California** | California dollar (CAD) | Pure gold (never leaves the gold standard) | Pure gold (never abandons it) | "Golden Bear" |

### Key Locked Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **No shared currency** | Treaty of San Francisco (1873) explicitly forbids it. |
| **All convertible at par** | 1 USD = 1 CSD = 1 CAD for international settlements (fixed by treaty 1873, renewed every 20 years). |
| **Gold standard until 1933** | All three stay on gold through the 1929 crash (California never leaves it). |
| **1933–1939** | U.S. goes off gold (New Deal analogue). CSA follows partially. California stays on gold and becomes the continent's hard-money haven. |

## SECTION 6: TARIFFS IN NTL

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

### Tariff Evolution

| Period | U.S. vs CSA | U.S. vs California | CSA vs California | External Tariffs |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **1865–1905** | Punitive tariffs (1865–1905) → zero internal tariffs after 1905 | Zero tariffs from day one (Treaty of San Francisco 1873) | Zero tariffs from 1905 onward | All three negotiate common external tariff every 10 years (first 1905, renewed 1915, 1925, 1935) |
| **1905–1939** | Zero tariffs (Economic Concord 1905) | Zero tariffs | Zero tariffs | Same |
| **Post-1939 (guidance only)** | Zero tariffs forever | Zero tariffs | Zero tariffs | Same |

### Locked Rule That Never Changes

**"No tariff shall ever be raised between the three American republics without the unanimous consent of all three."**

### Real-World Result

**1865–1905:** Cold trade war between U.S. and CSA (punitive tariffs on slave-grown goods).

California is the loophole everyone uses.

**1905:** Toombs repeal → boycott ends → North-American Economic Concord (zero internal tariffs, common external tariff).

**1905–2025:** The continent functions as a single economic zone with three currencies and three flags.

## SECTION 7: GREAT DEPRESSION IN NTL

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The Great Depression in the NTL:

- Starts the same (1929 crash + Dust Bowl)
- Hits harder and more unevenly
- Ends sooner because California refuses to let the other two collapse
- Leaves the three republics richer together than apart
- and hating each other a little more for needing the help

### The Four Phases

| Phase | Years | What the Three Republics Actually Do | Realism Check |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1 – Blame** | 1929–1931 | Each blames the others.<br>U.S.: "California hoarded gold and crashed the market."<br>CSA: "Yankee speculators and their tariffs."<br>California: "You both printed money like it was 1861 never ended." | 10/10 – classic post-crash finger-pointing |
| **Phase 2 – Compete** | 1931–1934 | Currency war, tariff war, beggar-thy-neighbour. All three devalue, raise barriers, try to steal markets from each other. | 10/10 – Smoot-Hawley on steroids |
| **Phase 3 – Panic** | 1934–1936 | Dust Bowl + bank runs hit simultaneously. Unemployment: U.S. 34%, CSA 39%, California 19%. Real starvation in Arkansas, breadlines while California still has oranges. | 10/10 – fractured continent = no unified safety net |
| **Phase 4 – Forced Cooperation** | 1936–1940 | California (least hurt, sitting on oil and gold) blackmails the other two into the table.<br>Result: North-American Economic Concord (1936) – joint gold pool, coordinated public works, California bankrolls relief at low interest. | 9/10 – exactly how real small rich countries force bigger poor neighbours to behave (think Switzerland in 1930s) |

### Depression by Republic

| Republic | Peak Unemployment | Worst Year | How They Survive the Depression |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **U.S. (East)** | 34–36% | 1934 | California loans + CSA raw materials |
| **CSA** | 38–41% | 1935 | California oil credits + U.S. factory orders |
| **Republic of California** | 17–19% | 1932 | Gold, oil, Hollywood, ports – barely feels it |

### Final Outcome by 1940

Depression ends faster than OTL (California money)

But the continent is now economically fused in a way OTL America never was

The triad is born in the crucible of mutual desperation

and no one ever lets anyone forget who paid the bills
