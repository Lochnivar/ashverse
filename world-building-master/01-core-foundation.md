## SECTION 1: POINT OF DIVERGENCE

### Exact Moment
**Date:** July 1, 1863  
**Time:** ~10:30 p.m.  
**Location:** Gettysburg, Pennsylvania  
**Specific Location:** Widow Leister house (Lee's headquarters tent)

### OTL (Our Timeline)
Lee, exhausted and already showing signs of heart trouble, retires for the night believing the first day's fighting has been a Confederate success.

### NTL (AshVerse Timeline)
After nightfall, while dictating orders and still furious that Ewell failed to take Cemetery Hill, Lee suffers a fatal cardiac event in his headquarters tent at the Widow Leister house. He collapses mid-sentence and dies within minutes, surrounded by staff officers.

### Immediate Aftermath

**10:47 p.m., July 1, 1863**
Longstreet is summoned to Lee's headquarters.

**The Long Night (July 1-2, 1863)**
Longstreet spends the entire night alone with:
- Lee's corpse
- The weight of command he already knew was his (Davis had established the succession months ago, and Lee had briefed him personally)
- The knowledge that:
  - The Union now holds the high ground
  - Lee's last verbal order was "attack at dawn"
  - Longstreet's own instinct is to withdraw while the army is still intact

**4:12 a.m., July 2, 1863**
Longstreet quietly writes the order that ends the battle that never was:

**"The army will withdraw northwest at first light.  
We leave the field to the enemy,  
but we take the war with us."**

### Consequences
- The Army of Northern Virginia withdraws intact
- Gettysburg does not become the decisive Union victory of OTL
- The war continues in a different form
- Eventually leads to negotiated peace and Confederate independence
- The match has been struck - everything flows from this moment

### Key Details
- **Lee's Last Words:** Mid-sentence while dictating orders
- **Lee's Last Order (Verbal):** "attack at dawn"
- **Lee's State of Mind:** Still furious that Ewell failed to take Cemetery Hill
- **Longstreet's Decision:** Withdraw to preserve the army
- **Command Structure:** Longstreet was already established as second in command - well-established chain of command, no dramatic reveal needed
- **The Order:** Written at 4:12 a.m., July 2, 1863

### Significance
This is the exact moment where history diverges. Everything in the AshVerse timeline flows from Longstreet's decision to withdraw rather than attack. The phrase "We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us" becomes emblematic of the entire series - the war continues, just in different forms, for decades to come.

## SECTION 2: CORE PREMISE

### **LOCKED CANON POSITION - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

### The Fundamental Truth

**Gettysburg was the battle the Confederacy could not afford to fight  
and the battle the Union could not afford to lose.**

Lee's death on 1 July 1863  
is the single moment the South is saved from its own victory disease  
and the North is condemned to lose a war it was morally right to win.

That is the cold, ugly, historically honest foundation of the entire series.

### OTL Gettysburg: Lee's Worst Strategic Decision

OTL Gettysburg (1–3 July 1863) was Lee's **worst strategic decision of the war**:

- He invaded Pennsylvania with an army that was already at its absolute peak (never again would the ANV be that strong).
- He fought a three-day offensive battle on ground not of his choosing, against interior lines, for no decisive strategic objective.
- He lost ~28,000 men (37% of the army) – a loss the Confederacy never recovered from.
- The simultaneous fall of Vicksburg four days later turned it into a twin catastrophe that **re-energised** Northern morale at the exact moment it was cracking.

### NTL: Longstreet's Withdrawal

In the NTL, Lee's death on the night of 1 July forces Longstreet to do what he always wanted:  
**withdraw before the army is destroyed**.

### The Comparison

| Metric | OTL (Lee fights) | NTL (Longstreet withdraws) |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|
| ANV casualties Jul–Oct 1863 | ~30,000 | ~12,000–15,000 |
| ANV strength spring 1864 | ~45,000 | ~55,000–58,000 |
| Northern morale after campaign | "We can win this!" | "They're still here… and we can't stop them." |
| Political outcome 1864 | Lincoln re-elected | McClellan elected on peace platform |

### The Core Premise

The story itself is based on the idea that Lee made a massive strategic blunder at Gettysburg. By staying and fighting, he destroyed the ANV for no good purpose and gave Lincoln the morale boost to rally shaky northern nerves.

**Yes, 100% – and the NTL is the proof.**

The entire AshVerse rests on one truth:

**Gettysburg was the battle the Confederacy could not afford to fight  
and the battle the Union could not afford to lose.**

**No changes allowed.**

## SECTION 3: WORLD SETTINGS

### Primary Setting
**Name:** North America (Alternate History)

**Type:** Alternate history of North America, 1863-1939

**Overview:** Following Robert E. Lee's death at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, the American Civil War takes a different course, resulting in an independent Confederacy. Over the next 76 years, the continent reshapes itself: Native American super-states rise, California secedes, slavery dies slowly through economics and politics, and by 1939, the continent watches as Europe burns again.

### Geography

#### Political Divisions (Post-1863)

**Confederate States of America**
- **Location:** The South, as historically defined
- **Capital:** Richmond, Virginia
- **Status:** Independent nation after negotiated peace
- **Key Cities:** Richmond, Atlanta, New Orleans, Charleston
- **Economy:** Struggles with independence, agriculture-based, later industrializes
- **Population:** White Southerners, enslaved people (until 1905), freedmen
- **Challenges:** Economic survival, maintaining slavery (legally until 1905), modernization

**United States of America**
- **Location:** The North and West (excluding California and Native territories)
- **Capital:** Washington, D.C.

### Time Period
- **Era:** 1863-1939 (Alternate History)
- **Technology Level:** Follows historical progression: Civil War era → Industrial Revolution → Early 20th century → 1930s
- **Historical Context:** Diverges from our timeline at July 1, 1863 (Lee's death at Gettysburg). Everything after that follows the alternate path.

### Key Historical Divergences
- **1863:** Lee dies at Gettysburg, war takes different course
- **1863-1865:** Negotiated peace, Confederacy becomes independent
- **1870s-1890s:** Native super-states consolidate, California secedes
- **1880s-1905:** Slavery dies in practice but remains legal
- **1905:** Slavery finally abolished legally (20 years after practice)
- **1930s:** Great Depression, rising European tensions
- **1939:** Europe goes to war, continent watches

### Notes
- Maintain historical accuracy where possible, but clearly show divergence
- Focus on political, economic, and social consequences of the split
- Show how institutions (like slavery) can persist legally while dying in practice
- Emphasize the complexity: no one was entirely "right"
- The Fairfax and Haskell families provide multi-generational perspective
- The continent must learn to live with the consequences of choices made

## SECTION 4: THE SOVEREIGNTY PARALLEL

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The Native super-states (and Deseret) win sovereignty in 1865  
for the exact same reason the Thirteen Colonies won it in 1776:

A distracted, exhausted, over-stretched imperial power  
that can't spare the troops to crush the rebellion  
because it's busy bleeding itself dry somewhere else.

### The Parallel

| Year | Empire Too Busy to Enforce Control | Rebellion That Slips the Leash |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **1776** | Britain fighting France globally | Thirteen Colonies |
| **1865** | U.S. & CSA fighting each other | Sequoyah, Dakota, Comanchería, Navajo, Deseret |

### The Irony

The devil is laughing so hard he's crying.

The continent's final joke:

**The United States becomes Britain in 1776.  
And the tribes become the Americans.**

They don't win independence by being stronger.

They win it because the white nations are too busy tearing each other apart  
to notice the jail door was left open.

### The Result

1865 is 1776 in war-bonnets and buckskin.

And nobody in Washington or Richmond  
ever quite lives it down.

That's not irony.

That's poetic justice with a tomahawk.
