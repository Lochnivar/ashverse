## EVALUATION

### Advantages of Topic-Based Format:

✅ **Focused:** Each file addresses one specific assumption/topic  
✅ **Standardized:** Consistent format makes comparison easy  
✅ **Reference-Friendly:** Quick lookup for specific topics  
✅ **Modular:** Easy to update individual topics without affecting others  
✅ **Clear Structure:** Assumption → Parameters → Results → Caveats is logical flow  
✅ **Preserves Detail:** All analysis for a topic in one place  

### Potential Issues:

⚠️ **File Count:** ~30 topic files vs 8 master files (but more focused)  
⚠️ **Cross-References:** Some topics relate to others (but can link)  
⚠️ **Consolidation Effort:** Need to extract assumptions/parameters from existing files  

### Comparison:

**Category-Based (8 files):**
- Pros: Fewer files, broader context
- Cons: Harder to find specific topics, less standardized

**Topic-Based (~30 files):**
- Pros: Focused, standardized, easy reference
- Cons: More files, but better organized

## RECOMMENDATION

**Topic-based format is superior** because:

1. **Better for Reference:** When you need to check "Is Pickett's raid force size plausible?" you go directly to that topic file
2. **Standardized Format:** Every file follows same structure (assumption → parameters → results → caveats)
3. **Easier Updates:** Update one topic without affecting others
4. **Clearer Purpose:** Each file has one clear purpose
5. **Better for AI:** Easier to parse and understand specific analyses

**Implementation:**
- Create `analysis-master/` directory
- Create ~30 topic files with standardized format
- Extract assumptions, parameters, results, caveats from existing files
- Archive original files

---

## NEXT STEPS

If approved:
1. Create standardized template
2. Identify all topics and their assumptions
3. Extract parameters and results from existing files
4. Create topic files with standardized format
5. Archive original files
