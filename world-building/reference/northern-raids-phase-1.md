## PHASE 1: ORGANIZED RAIDS (1865-1867) - ~50 Total

### TIER 1: Named Raids (Extended Summaries)

#### 7. The Mississippi Crossing (CSA: "The First Terror")
**Date:** June 8-12, 1865  
**Location:** Mississippi River, Arkansas-Mississippi border  
**Leader:** Major William T. Sherman (no relation to Union general), ex-Union cavalry  
**Force:** 95 raiders (Union veterans, freedmen guides, New England abolitionists)

**The Raid:**
The first major raid after the Treaty of Cincinnati, establishing the pattern that would define the movement. Major Sherman (a Union cavalry officer who refused to accept Confederate independence) led a mixed force across the Mississippi River from Arkansas into Mississippi. The raid targeted six cotton plantations along the river, using the waterway as both approach and escape route. Raiders burned 2,400 acres of cotton fields, destroyed three cotton gins, and freed 680 enslaved people. The operation lasted four days, with raiders using hit-and-run tactics perfected during the war. No plantation houses were burned, no families harmed—the "burn crops, spare cradles" rule established from the first major operation.

**The Outcome:**
All 680 freed slaves successfully crossed into Sequoyah via the Underground Railroad network. Economic damage: $185,000 (crops, infrastructure, lost production). Casualties: 3 raiders killed, 8 wounded; 12 Confederate guards killed, 5 wounded. The raid proved that organized cells could operate effectively even immediately after the treaty, setting the precedent for the "Last Hurrah" period.

**The Significance:**
This raid established the operational template: river-based approach, coordinated multi-plantation strikes, strict rules of engagement, and guaranteed escape routes to Sequoyah. It proved the movement could operate at scale immediately after the war's end, before the Committee of Nine formalized coordination. The dual naming ("Mississippi Crossing" vs. "First Terror") shows the propaganda war beginning immediately—CSA newspapers called it terrorism, raiders called it liberation.

#### 8. The Tennessee Valley Ride (CSA: "The Valley Massacre")
**Date:** August 15-22, 1865  
**Location:** Tennessee Valley, Alabama (Madison, Limestone, Morgan counties)  
**Leader:** Major Frank A. Haskell (ex-Union officer, resigned commission after Court of Grievances scene)  
**Force:** 180 raiders (mix of Union veterans, freedmen, New England idealists)

**The Raid:**
The largest single-raid slave liberation of Phase 1, freeing over 4,200 enslaved people across 23 plantations in the fertile Tennessee Valley. Major Frank A. Haskell, who had resigned his commission after the final scene of "The Match" - the Court of Grievances at Appomattox where Thomas Fairfax delivered one insult too far - organized the largest coordinated strike of the early period. Haskell brought professional military discipline to the movement, applying his Union Army experience to create a "rolling thunder" approach—striking multiple plantations simultaneously across a 40-mile front, preventing Confederate forces from concentrating. Raiders burned 8,600 acres of cotton, destroyed 12 cotton gins, and systematically freed every enslaved person they encountered. The operation required precise coordination: three separate columns converged on the valley, struck simultaneously, and withdrew along different routes to Sequoyah. Haskell's leadership imprinted professionalism on the movement, establishing tactical standards that would persist long after his retirement.

**The Outcome:**
4,247 slaves freed (largest single-raid liberation in the entire 29-year period). Economic damage: $420,000 (crops, infrastructure, lost production). Casualties: 7 raiders killed, 18 wounded; 34 Confederate guards/militia killed, 22 wounded. All freed slaves successfully reached Sequoyah via three separate routes. The raid demonstrated that large-scale operations were possible with proper coordination and professional leadership.

**The Significance:**
This raid proved the movement could operate at unprecedented scale. The 4,200+ liberation number became legendary—no single raid would match it until the viral spread period. It showed that the "Committee of Nine" coordination model could work for massive operations, especially with professional military leadership. Haskell's tactical innovations—the "rolling thunder" approach, precise coordination, disciplined withdrawal—became standard operating procedure for the movement. The CSA response was immediate and brutal: increased patrols, harsher penalties, but the damage was done. This raid also established the Tennessee Valley as a primary target zone due to its proximity to Sequoyah.

**Character Links:**
**Haskell Family Connection:** Major Frank A. Haskell (Gen 0) leads this raid, his first major operation after resigning his commission. The scale of the operation and the successful liberation of 4,200 people establishes his reputation as a professional raider leader. This raid becomes the template for his leadership style: disciplined, coordinated, effective.

#### 9. The Kentucky Night (CSA: "The Bluegrass Terror")
**Date:** September 23-24, 1865  
**Location:** Western Kentucky (Graves, Calloway, Marshall counties)  
**Leader:** Captain John Brown Jr. (son of abolitionist John Brown, ex-Union officer)  
**Force:** 65 raiders (Kansas Jayhawkers, Union veterans, local Kentucky Unionists)

**The Raid:**
The first major raid into Kentucky, a border state that remained in the Union but where slavery was still legal. This created a political firestorm—raiders were operating in a Union state, targeting Union citizens (technically). Captain Brown Jr., carrying his father's legacy, led a daring night raid across the Ohio River into Kentucky. The operation targeted five plantations along the river, using the cover of darkness and local Unionist guides. Raiders freed 420 enslaved people and burned 1,800 acres of tobacco and hemp (Kentucky's primary cash crops). The raid lasted only 36 hours—strike at dusk, liberate through the night, withdraw by dawn.

**The Outcome:**
420 slaves freed, all successfully crossed into Ohio (Union territory, then to Sequoyah). Economic damage: $95,000. Casualties: 2 raiders killed, 5 wounded; 8 Kentucky slave owners/guards killed, 12 wounded. The political fallout was immediate: Kentucky demanded Union intervention, but the Union had no legal basis to stop raids into a state where slavery was legal.

**The Significance:**
This raid exposed the legal and political contradictions of the post-war settlement. Kentucky was a Union state, but slavery was legal—raiders were "liberating" people from Union citizens. The raid forced the Union to confront its own complicity: it had recognized Confederate independence, but what about slavery in Union states? The political implications were profound: the Union couldn't stop the raids without appearing to support slavery, but couldn't condone them without alienating Kentucky. This raid established that border states were fair game, regardless of their Union status.

#### 10. The Georgia Uprising (CSA: "The Peach State Massacre")
**Date:** November 8-15, 1865  
**Location:** North Georgia (Gordon, Bartow, Cherokee counties)  
**Leader:** Ex-Colonel Elijah P. Lovejoy (named for abolitionist martyr, ex-Union infantry)  
**Force:** 120 raiders (Union veterans, freedmen scouts, Georgia Unionists)

**The Raid:**
The first major deep penetration into the Deep South, proving raiders could operate far from border states. Colonel Lovejoy led a force 150 miles into Georgia, targeting the rich cotton plantations of the Piedmont region. This was high-risk: deep behind Confederate lines, far from escape routes, surrounded by hostile territory. The raid used a "lightning strike" approach: hit hard, move fast, don't linger. Raiders struck eight plantations over seven days, burning 4,200 acres of cotton, destroying six cotton gins, and freeing 890 enslaved people. The operation required careful navigation through Confederate territory, using local guides and freedmen networks.

**The Outcome:**
890 slaves freed, all successfully reached Sequoyah via a circuitous route through Tennessee. Economic damage: $210,000. Casualties: 11 raiders killed, 19 wounded (highest casualties of Phase 1); 28 Confederate guards/militia killed, 31 wounded. The high casualties reflected the danger of deep penetration, but the raid proved it was possible.

**The Significance:**
This raid shattered the illusion that Deep South plantations were safe. If raiders could strike 150 miles into Georgia, nowhere was truly secure. It demonstrated the movement's reach and determination. The raid also showed that freedmen networks extended deep into the South, providing intelligence and escape routes. This established the pattern for later "following the planters" raids—raiders could operate wherever slavery existed, regardless of distance.

**Character Links:**
**Fairfax Family Connection:** Thomas Reginald Fairfax (future patriarch) witnesses the raid's aftermath in Georgia. The realization that nowhere is safe becomes a defining moment in his understanding of the new reality.

#### 11. The Christmas Raid (CSA: "The Yuletide Outrage")
**Date:** December 24-26, 1865  
**Location:** Multi-state coordinated strike (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas)  
**Leader:** Major Frank A. Haskell (strategic coordination), Committee of Nine (overall planning)  
**Force:** 450 raiders total (largest coordinated multi-raid operation)

**The Raid:**
The largest coordinated multi-raid operation of Phase 1, striking simultaneously across four states on Christmas Eve. The Committee of Nine organized this as a statement: slavery doesn't take holidays. Major Frank A. Haskell provided strategic coordination, applying his military experience to synchronize five separate cells across vast distances. Five separate cells struck 31 plantations across Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas, using the holiday distraction to maximum effect. Plantation owners were celebrating, guards were relaxed, and the timing caught everyone off-guard. The coordinated strikes freed 2,800 enslaved people, burned 12,000 acres of cotton, and destroyed 18 cotton gins. Haskell's coordination skills proved essential—his ability to synchronize operations across four states demonstrated the value of professional military leadership in the movement.

**The Outcome:**
2,800 slaves freed across four states. Economic damage: $680,000 (largest single-operation damage of Phase 1). Casualties: 14 raiders killed, 32 wounded; 47 Confederate guards/militia killed, 58 wounded. All freed slaves successfully reached Sequoyah via multiple routes. The timing—Christmas—was both symbolic and tactical, showing raiders would strike when least expected.

**The Significance:**
This raid proved the Committee of Nine could coordinate massive operations across state lines. The Christmas timing was both symbolic (slavery doesn't rest) and tactical (maximum surprise). It demonstrated the movement's organizational capacity and strategic thinking. The multi-state coordination showed this wasn't random violence—it was a coordinated campaign. The raid also established that holidays were fair game, removing any notion of "rules" or "honor" in the conflict. Major Frank A. Haskell's strategic coordination was essential to synchronizing five cells across four states.

**Character Links:**
**Haskell Family Connection:** Major Frank A. Haskell provides strategic coordination for this massive multi-state operation, demonstrating his ability to synchronize complex operations across vast distances. His professional military experience proves essential to the operation's success.

#### 12. The New Year's Reckoning (CSA: "The January Terror")
**Date:** January 1-3, 1866  
**Location:** Missouri-Arkansas border region  
**Leader:** Captain "Wild Bill" Hickok (ex-Union scout, future legend)  
**Force:** 85 raiders (Missouri Unionists, Kansas Jayhawkers, freedmen)

**The Raid:**
A direct response to Confederate crackdown attempts, proving the movement would escalate if pressed. Captain Hickok led a force targeting the Missouri-Arkansas border, where Confederate authorities had increased patrols after the Christmas Raid. The raid was deliberately aggressive: strike where they're watching, prove you can't be stopped. Raiders hit seven plantations along the border, freed 620 enslaved people, and burned 3,400 acres of cotton. The operation included a deliberate confrontation with Confederate patrols—raiders engaged and defeated a 40-man patrol, sending a message that increased security wouldn't stop them.

**The Outcome:**
620 slaves freed. Economic damage: $155,000. Casualties: 6 raiders killed, 12 wounded; 18 Confederate guards/patrol killed, 24 wounded (including the deliberate patrol engagement). The raid proved that increased security measures were ineffective against determined raiders.

**The Significance:**
This raid demonstrated the movement's willingness to escalate in response to crackdowns. When Confederate authorities increased patrols, raiders didn't back down—they struck harder. The deliberate engagement with Confederate patrols showed this wasn't just hit-and-run—raiders would fight if necessary. This established the pattern: every crackdown attempt would be met with increased raids, creating an escalating cycle.

#### 13. The Missouri Border War (CSA: "The Show-Me State Massacre")
**Date:** February 14-18, 1866  
**Location:** Missouri (St. Louis area, along Mississippi River)  
**Leader:** Ex-Major Samuel Clemens (future "Mark Twain," ex-Union riverboat pilot)  
**Force:** 70 raiders (Missouri Unionists, riverboat men, freedmen)

**The Raid:**
The first major raid to trigger joint USA-CSA border patrols, exposing the political tensions. Major Clemens (using his riverboat knowledge) led a raid targeting plantations along the Mississippi River near St. Louis. The operation used the river as both approach and escape route, with raiders arriving and departing by boat. Raiders struck five plantations, freed 480 enslaved people, and burned 2,200 acres of cotton. The raid's proximity to St. Louis (a major Union city) created immediate political pressure for joint action.

**The Outcome:**
480 slaves freed. Economic damage: $125,000. Casualties: 4 raiders killed, 9 wounded; 15 Confederate guards killed, 18 wounded. The political fallout was immediate: Missouri demanded Union intervention, and the first discussions of joint USA-CSA border patrols began.

**The Significance:**
This raid forced the political issue: what happens when raiders operate near Union cities? The proximity to St. Louis created pressure for joint action, leading to the eventual Border Pacification Act. The raid also demonstrated that river-based operations were highly effective—raiders could strike and escape via waterways, making interception difficult. This established the river-raid pattern that would continue throughout Phase 1.

**Character Links:**
None (character-neutral, though Clemens connection is historical easter egg)

#### 14. The Spring Offensive (CSA: "The March Massacre")
**Date:** March 20-April 5, 1866  
**Location:** Multi-state coordinated campaign (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi)  
**Leader:** Major Frank A. Haskell (campaign coordination), Committee of Nine (overall planning)  
**Force:** 380 raiders total across 12 separate cells

**The Raid:**
The Committee of Nine's largest coordinated campaign, a 16-day offensive across three states. Major Frank A. Haskell coordinated the campaign, applying his military experience to sustain operations over extended periods. Twelve separate cells struck 47 plantations, using spring planting season (when fields were vulnerable) to maximum effect. The campaign freed 3,400 enslaved people, burned 18,000 acres of cotton (including newly planted fields), and destroyed 24 cotton gins. Haskell's campaign coordination proved essential—his ability to sustain operations over 16 days across three states demonstrated the value of professional military leadership. The operation demonstrated the Committee's ability to sustain coordinated operations over extended periods and across vast areas, but it was Haskell's tactical discipline that made it possible.

**The Outcome:**
3,400 slaves freed. Economic damage: $820,000 (largest campaign damage of Phase 1). Casualties: 19 raiders killed, 41 wounded; 62 Confederate guards/militia killed, 78 wounded. The campaign's success proved the movement could operate at scale over extended periods.

**The Significance:**
This campaign established the Committee of Nine as a serious military organization, not just random raiders. The ability to coordinate 12 cells over 16 days across three states showed sophisticated planning and execution. The timing (spring planting) was strategically brilliant—destroying newly planted crops meant maximum economic impact. This campaign also demonstrated that the movement could sustain operations, not just one-off strikes.

None (character-neutral)

#### 15. The Memorial Day Massacre (CSA) / The Liberation Ride (Raiders)
**Date:** May 30, 1866  
**Location:** Central Tennessee (Davidson, Williamson, Rutherford counties)  
**Leader:** Ex-Colonel Joshua Chamberlain (ex-Union officer, future Maine governor)  
**Force:** 140 raiders (Union veterans, Tennessee Unionists, freedmen)

**The Raid:**
A politically charged raid on Memorial Day, deliberately timing the strike to coincide with Confederate memorial services. Colonel Chamberlain led a force targeting eight plantations in central Tennessee, using the holiday distraction. The raid freed 720 enslaved people and burned 4,600 acres of cotton. The timing was both symbolic (striking on a day of Confederate remembrance) and tactical (maximum surprise during memorial services).

**The Outcome:**
720 slaves freed. Economic damage: $185,000. Casualties: 5 raiders killed, 14 wounded; 22 Confederate guards/militia killed, 28 wounded. The political fallout was immediate: Confederate newspapers called it a "desecration of sacred memory," while Northern papers called it "justice delayed."

**The Significance:**
This raid exposed the raw political and emotional wounds of the post-war period. Striking on Memorial Day was deliberately provocative, showing raiders would not respect Confederate traditions or memorials. The dual naming ("Memorial Day Massacre" vs. "Liberation Ride") shows the propaganda war at its most intense. This raid also demonstrated that raiders would use holidays and symbolic dates for both tactical and political effect.

**Character Links:**
None (character-neutral, though Chamberlain connection is historical easter egg)

#### 16. The Arkansas River Crossing (CSA: "The River Terror")
**Date:** June 12-16, 1866  
**Location:** Arkansas River Valley (Pulaski, Jefferson, Arkansas counties)  
**Leader:** Captain "River" Jim Reed (ex-Union riverboat captain)  
**Force:** 90 raiders (riverboat men, Union veterans, freedmen)

**The Raid:**
A tactical innovation raid, using the Arkansas River as both approach and escape route. Captain Reed (a former riverboat captain) led a force that traveled entirely by boat, striking plantations along the river and escaping the same way. This was the first major "river-only" raid, proving waterways were ideal for hit-and-run operations. Raiders struck six plantations along a 60-mile stretch of river, freed 550 enslaved people, and burned 3,200 acres of cotton. The river-based approach made interception nearly impossible—raiders could strike and be miles away before Confederate forces could respond.

**The Outcome:**
550 slaves freed. Economic damage: $140,000. Casualties: 3 raiders killed, 7 wounded; 14 Confederate guards killed, 19 wounded. The river-based escape was 100% successful—no raiders were captured, all freed slaves reached Sequoyah.

**The Significance:**
This raid established river-based operations as a primary tactical method. The river approach was faster, safer, and more effective than overland operations. It demonstrated that raiders could use geography to their advantage, turning waterways into highways. This tactical innovation would be copied throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2, making river-based raids a standard method.

None (character-neutral)

#### 17. The Independence Day Raid (CSA: "The Fourth of July Massacre")
**Date:** July 4, 1866  
**Location:** Multi-state simultaneous strikes (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky)  
**Leader:** Major Frank A. Haskell (strategic coordination), Committee of Nine (overall planning)  
**Force:** 520 raiders total across 18 separate cells

**The Raid:**
The largest single-day operation of Phase 1, a coordinated strike across five states on Independence Day. The Committee of Nine organized 18 separate cells to strike simultaneously on July 4th, using the holiday as both symbolic statement and tactical advantage. Major Frank A. Haskell provided strategic coordination, applying his military experience to synchronize 18 cells across five states in a single day. The operation struck 52 plantations in a single day, freed 2,200 enslaved people, and burned 14,000 acres of cotton. The timing was deliberately symbolic: striking on the day celebrating American independence, while the Confederacy denied that independence to enslaved people.

**The Outcome:**
2,200 slaves freed in a single day (largest single-day liberation). Economic damage: $540,000 (largest single-day damage). Casualties: 12 raiders killed, 28 wounded; 38 Confederate guards/militia killed, 51 wounded. The coordination across five states in a single day proved the Committee's organizational capacity.

**The Significance:**
This raid demonstrated the movement's ability to coordinate massive single-day operations across multiple states. The Independence Day timing was both symbolic (freedom for all) and tactical (maximum surprise). It proved the Committee of Nine could execute complex, multi-state operations with precision timing. Major Frank A. Haskell's coordination skills were essential to synchronizing 18 cells across five states in a single day. This raid also established July 4th as a "target date" for future operations, showing raiders would use symbolic dates for maximum impact.

**Character Links:**
**Haskell Family Connection:** Major Frank A. Haskell provides strategic coordination for this massive single-day operation, demonstrating his ability to synchronize complex multi-state operations. His professional military experience proves essential to the operation's success.

#### 18. The Last Summer (CSA: "The August Terror")
**Date:** August 10-25, 1866  
**Location:** Multi-state final coordinated effort (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas)  
**Leader:** Major Frank A. Haskell (final campaign coordination), Committee of Nine (overall planning)  
**Force:** 360 raiders total across 10 separate cells

**The Raid:**
The Committee of Nine's final major coordinated effort before the crackdown began. Major Frank A. Haskell coordinated his final campaign, knowing that increased suppression was coming. Ten cells struck 38 plantations over 15 days, knowing that the organized phase was ending. The campaign freed 2,600 enslaved people, burned 15,000 acres of cotton, and destroyed 22 cotton gins. This was a "last hurrah" operation—raiders knew the organized phase was ending, so they struck hard one last time. Haskell's leadership in this final campaign would be his last major operation before retirement.

**The Outcome:**
2,600 slaves freed. Economic damage: $640,000. Casualties: 16 raiders killed, 35 wounded; 54 Confederate guards/militia killed, 67 wounded. The campaign's success proved the movement could operate effectively even as suppression increased.

**The Significance:**
This raid marked the end of the organized Phase 1 period. The Committee of Nine knew that joint USA-CSA crackdowns were coming, so this was their final major coordinated effort. The campaign proved the movement's effectiveness even under increasing pressure. After this, organized cells would be crushed, but the movement would continue in decentralized form. This raid represents the transition point between organized and viral phases. For Major Frank A. Haskell, this was his final campaign—within months, the Border Pacification Act would create joint USA-CSA patrols, and Haskell would face Union blue on the other side of the carbine. That moral conflict—fighting his own nation—would end his raiding career. He would retire to Manchester, New Hampshire, having imprinted professionalism on the movement but unwilling to fight against Union troops.

**Character Links:**
**Haskell Family Connection:** Major Frank A. Haskell coordinates his final campaign. Within months, joint USA-CSA patrols begin, and Haskell faces the moral conflict that ends his raiding career: "I won't fight against my nation." He retires to Manchester, New Hampshire, having led raids for almost two years (1865-1867) and imprinted professionalism on the movement.

### TIER 2: Notable Raids (Brief Entries)

#### September 1866: The Desperation Wave
**Location:** Tennessee, Alabama border region  
**Brief Description:** Final desperate operations as crackdown looms. Three cells strike 12 plantations, freeing 480 slaves and causing $120,000 damage. Smaller, more desperate raids as organized cells go underground.  
**Why Notable:** Last major operations before organized cells are crushed, shows transition to decentralized phase.

#### October 1866: The Underground Operations
**Location:** Kentucky-Tennessee border  
**Brief Description:** Cells begin operating in complete secrecy as joint patrols increase. Two successful raids free 320 slaves, $85,000 damage. Operations become smaller, more careful, less coordinated.  
**Why Notable:** Shows transition from organized to underground operations.

#### November 1866: The Winter Lull
**Location:** Multi-state  
**Brief Description:** Raids decrease as winter sets in and suppression increases. Only four documented raids, 180 slaves freed total, $45,000 damage. Movement goes fully underground.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates seasonal patterns and suppression effectiveness.

#### December 1866: The Christmas Eve Strike
**Location:** Arkansas  
**Brief Description:** Single cell strikes three plantations on Christmas Eve, freeing 140 slaves, $35,000 damage. Symbolic timing, but smaller scale than previous Christmas operations.  
**Why Notable:** Shows movement continuing despite suppression, but at reduced scale.

#### January 1867: The New Year's Hope
**Location:** Tennessee  
**Brief Description:** Two cells coordinate (rare in this period) to strike five plantations, freeing 280 slaves, $70,000 damage. Brief coordination before full crackdown begins.  
**Why Notable:** Last coordinated effort before organized cells are completely crushed.

#### February 1867: The Last Coordinated Strike
**Location:** Alabama-Mississippi border  
**Brief Description:** Committee of Nine's final operation before dissolution. Three cells strike eight plantations, freeing 420 slaves, $105,000 damage. After this, organized coordination ends.  
**Why Notable:** Marks end of organized Phase 1, beginning of suppression period.

#### March 1867: The Suppression Begins
**Location:** Multi-state  
**Brief Description:** Joint USA-CSA patrols begin in earnest. Only two documented raids, 95 slaves freed, $24,000 damage. Organized cells are being hunted and destroyed.  
**Why Notable:** Beginning of joint crackdown period, organized cells crushed.

#### April 1867: The Border Pacification
**Location:** Kentucky-Tennessee border  
**Brief Description:** First major joint USA-CSA patrol operation. One raid succeeds (120 slaves freed, $30,000 damage) but three cells are captured and destroyed.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates effectiveness of joint suppression, but also shows movement's resilience.

#### May 1867: The Organized Cells Crushed
**Location:** Multi-state  
**Brief Description:** Major crackdown operations destroy most organized cells. Only one documented raid (80 slaves freed, $20,000 damage), but movement goes fully decentralized.  
**Why Notable:** End of organized Phase 1, beginning of decentralized Phase 2.

#### June 1867: The Transition Period
**Location:** Tennessee, Arkansas  
**Brief Description:** First decentralized raids begin to appear. Three small, uncoordinated operations free 180 slaves, $45,000 damage. No central coordination, pure local initiative.  
**Why Notable:** Beginning of viral/decentralized Phase 2 period.

#### July 1867: The First Copy-Cats
**Location:** Multi-state  
**Brief Description:** Local cells begin copying earlier successful raids. Five small operations free 240 slaves, $60,000 damage. Movement becomes truly decentralized.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates viral spread mechanism—local cells copying successful methods.
