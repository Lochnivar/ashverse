# CANON REFRESHER FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**Purpose:** Quick reference for AI assistants - essential facts only  
**For detailed info:** See `canon-master-document.md` or specific `world-building/` files

---

## CRITICAL PROCESS RULES

### Golden Rule: No Original Text Modification
- **AI NEVER edits `books/` folder** - All suggestions go in `edits/`
- **AI NEVER locks canon** - Only user can lock
- **AI NEVER commits/pushes** unless explicitly requested

### Plausibility Gate
- **≥70%:** Acceptable | **<70%:** Avoid unless dramatically essential

### Honesty Rule
- **Don't invent details** not in context - Say "I don't have that info"
- **Don't guess** at canon facts - Offer to check documents

---

## POINT OF DIVERGENCE

**July 1, 1863:** Lee dies of heart attack at Gettysburg  
**July 2, 1863:** Longstreet takes command, countermarches NORTH (not west)  
**Result:** Harrisburg occupied, Longstreet escapes, North loses will to fight

---

## KEY FACTS (Quick Reference)

### Timeline Anchors
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jul 1863 | Lee dies, Longstreet takes command |
| Jul-Oct 1863 | Longstreet's Pennsylvania-Maryland raid |
| Aug-Sep 1863 | Warren's Meat-Grinder (Rappahannock-Rapidan disaster) |
| Jun-Jul 1864 | Pickett's Lightning Raid |
| Nov 1864 | McClellan elected (Lincoln loses) |
| Feb 1865 | Grant's Final Gamble fails at Appomattox |
| Mar 31, 1865 | **Treaty of Cincinnati** (CSA independence) |
| 1865-1894 | Northern Raids (~400 raids, 200k slaves freed) |
| 1873 | California secedes |
| 1877 | Texas secedes from CSA |
| 1894 | Slavery dies in practice (economics, not morality) |
| 1905 | Legal abolition in CSA |
| 1919 | American Concord (4 nations: USA, CSA, California, Texas) |
| 1939 | Europe burns (Stalin invades Poland, NOT Hitler) |

### The Four Nations (1939)
- **USA:** North + West (minus California). Lost the war.
- **CSA:** 11 states + Tennessee. West Virginia stays USA.
- **California:** Independent 1873. Pragmatic, richest, "youngest sibling who got rich."
- **Texas:** Independent 1877. Eternal grudge vs CSA. Jacksonian defiance.

### Also Sovereign
- **Sequoyah:** Cherokee-led Native state (thriving)
- **Mormon Deseret:** Theocracy, banking neutrality ("Mormon Venice")
- **Plains Nations:** Fragmented by 1900

### Core Themes
- **Slavery dies of ECONOMICS, not morality** (no Northern victory narrative)
- **Everyone is wrong** - No side purely good or evil
- **Scaffolding vs Payload** - Constitutional question survives, slavery too toxic

## CRITICAL "DO NOT" RULES

1. **DO NOT** edit `books/` folder directly
2. **DO NOT** assume OTL outcomes after July 1863
3. **DO NOT** forget slavery dies of **economics**, not morality
4. **DO NOT** forget Lincoln **never signs treaty** (loses election)
5. **DO NOT** forget West Virginia **stays USA**
6. **DO NOT** forget California is **pragmatic**, not moralistic
7. **DO NOT** assume Grant becomes general-in-chief (never promoted)
8. **DO NOT** assume Atlanta falls (besieged, never falls)
9. **DO NOT** assume Sherman's March to the Sea (war ends first)

---

## OTL EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPEN

**Military (95%+ certainty never happen):**
- Gettysburg Days 2-3 (Pickett's Charge, Little Round Top)
- Overland Campaign, Siege of Petersburg
- Sherman's March to the Sea
- Lee's surrender at Appomattox (April 9, 1865)

**Political:**
- Lincoln's re-election (McClellan wins)
- 13th/14th/15th Amendments
- Entire Reconstruction Era

---

## BOOK STRUCTURE

1. **The Match (1863-1865):** War ends
2. **The Flare (1865-1877):** Organized raids, Texas independence
3. **The Fire (1878-1894):** Viral raids, slavery dies
4. **The Embers (1895-1905):** Legal abolition
5. **The Quenching (1906-1919):** WWI, American Concord
6. **The Ashes (1920-1939):** Depression, Europe burns

## KEY TREATIES

### Treaty of Cincinnati (March 31, 1865)
- USA recognizes CSA independence
- West Virginia stays USA (LOCKED)
- Native super-states recognized (Article 4)
- Mormon Deseret recognized (Article 7)
- Signed by McClellan (Lincoln never signs)

### American Concord (1919)
- **Four nations:** USA, CSA, California, Texas
- Permanent seat: Monterey, California
- Texas refuses shared symbols with CSA (Tri-Flag stays 3 flags)

---

## WHEN IN DOUBT

1. Check plausibility (≥70%?)
2. Check if editing `books/` (use `edits/` instead)
3. Check if contradicting locked facts
4. Check if assuming OTL events happened
5. **If you don't know:** Say so, offer to check documents
