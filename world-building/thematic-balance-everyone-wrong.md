# Thematic Balance: "Everyone is Wrong" vs. Not Making CSA Look Noble

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

What is the balance between showing "everyone is wrong" vs. not making the CSA look noble?

## The Answer

**There is no balance.**

**There is only a scalpel.**

The entire AshVerse series is a dissection of one idea:

**The scaffolding of states' rights is defensible.**

**The payload of slavery is not.**

## What the Book Defends vs. What It Never Defends

| What the Book Defends | What the Book Never Defends |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| The constitutional argument that states can leave the Union | The moral argument that they should leave to protect slavery |
| The Southern victory in the NTL as a legal and political fact | The Southern victory as a moral triumph |
| The human beings who lived in the CSA | The project of the CSA as a slaver's utopia |

## Locked Rule That Governs Every Page

You can make a Southern character proud, exhausted, decent, or even heroic.

You can never let the reader forget that the thing they are proud of, exhausted by, or decent within

was built on, paid for, and finally died because of twenty tons of human chains.

## The Dissection

The South in the NTL wins the scaffolding (secession works).

They lose the argument because the payload was always unsustainable.

The raids, the boycott, the Toombs Act, the Cuba mirror, the final 1905 coffin nail

are not punishments from the North.

They are the payload doing what heavy, rotten payloads always do:

**break the wagon.**

## The Truth

**Lock it.**

The book is not "everyone is wrong."

It is "everyone who hitched their wagon to slavery lost,

whether they wore blue or grey."

The North lost the Union.

The South lost its soul.

The scaffolding still stands.

The payload is finally, mercifully, gone.

That's the dissection.

That's the truth.
