## NIGHT OF JULY 1, 1863 - LEE'S DEATH

### 22:30 - Final Conference & Death
- Lee and Longstreet debate next day's attack
- Lee insists on assault, Longstreet protests
- Lee retires to tent with chest pains
- **~22:30 p.m.** - General Robert E. Lee dies on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
- **Cause:** Cardiac arrest (heart attack)  
- **Plausibility:** 95%+ (age 56, known angina, extreme stress, July heat)

### 22:45-23:00 - Immediate Aftermath
- Surgeon summoned, confirms death
- Longstreet notified
- Lee's body moved to Schmucker house parlor
- Command transition begins

### 23:00-04:00 - Longstreet's Vigil

**Location:** Schmucker house parlor

**The Scene:** Longstreet sits with Lee's body for five hours, reviewing battles, counting costs, making his decision.

**Key Memories Recorded by Major Fairfax:**
- Manassas: Lee teaching restraint ("another field, another day")
- Seven Pines: Wrong decisions cost lives (6,000 casualties)
- Sharpsburg: "Able to fight again, not able to retreat"
- Catalog of battles: All the blood, all the dead

**The Decision Forms:** Between 03:00-04:00, Longstreet decides to withdraw north (not attack Cemetery Ridge, not retreat to Virginia). The decision crystallizes after five hours of reflection on Lee's death and the army's situation.

### 04:00 - The Order

**Longstreet to Major Fairfax:**
> "I believe we have an army to lead. New orders to be issued immediately. General Ewell is to begin withdrawing quietly."

**"Back to Virginia, sir?"**

> "No, we march north to Harrisburg. General Lee wanted us to be a thorn in the side of the Yankees and, by God, we're going to turn them green with rot."

**The torch has passed.**

## JULY 2, 1863 - THE WITHDRAWAL

### 04:00-04:15 - Longstreet's Written Order

**Full Text:**
> Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed. Maintain silence. No bugle calls. Muffle wagon wheels. We withdraw as ghosts. General Lee died at approximately 22:30 last evening. This news is restricted to general officers until we are clear of the enemy. First Corps will cover the rear. Move immediately.

---

## UNION REACTION TIMELINE

### 04:45 - First Light
- Withdrawal underway 40+ minutes
- Confederate lead elements 2-3 miles north
- Union army sleeping

### 05:30-06:00 - First Reports
**Buford's vedettes:** "Movement observed north of town"
- Too late - withdrawal 90 minutes old
- Lead elements 5-6 miles north

### 06:30 - Meade Awakened
**Hancock and Howard:** "Confederates appear to be leaving"

**Meade's Reaction:** "What is Lee doing? This must be a feint."

**Key Error:** Meade doesn't know Lee is dead. Every assumption based on Lee's past behavior.

### 07:00 - Reconnaissance Ordered
- Maintain positions
- Probe north cautiously
- Don't pursue without orders
- "I will not be drawn into another Chancellorsville"

### 08:00 - Discovery
**Union patrols find:**
- Seminary Ridge: Empty (except Hampton's cavalry screen)
- Oak Hill: Abandoned
- Gettysburg: Confederate troops marched through hours ago
- Large column visible 10+ miles north

### 08:30 - Report to Meade
"Entire Confederate army appears to be withdrawing north. Possibly toward Carlisle or Harrisburg."

### 09:00 - Council of War

**Hancock:** "We must pursue NOW!"

**Meade:** "Or walk into a trap. Lee never retreats. This must be a feint. We pursue tomorrow at dawn after VI Corps closes up."

**Result:** NO PURSUIT ON JULY 2

---

## MIDDAY CHECKPOINT (12:00 NOON)

### CONFEDERATE POSITIONS:

**Lead:**
- Reserve trains: 18 mi north (approaching Carlisle)
- Daniel's Brigade: 16 mi north

**Center:**
- Early, Johnson, Anderson, Pender: 8-14 mi north

**Rear:**
- Heth, Hood, McLaws: 3-8 mi north

**Total Column:** 18 miles long (Carlisle approach to north of Gettysburg)

**Confederate Achievement:** 8 hours marching, lead 18 miles from start, Union hasn't moved

---

### UNION STATUS:

**Position:** Still at Gettysburg (no movement)

**Meade's Assessment:** "They're heading for Carlisle. We march tomorrow."

**Washington Telegraph (09:30):** Meade reports withdrawal, requests guidance

**Halleck's Reply (11:00):** "Pursue with vigor but avoid trap. President says drive them out of Pennsylvania."

**Problem:** Conflicting orders ("be aggressive" AND "be cautious")

---

## EVENING CHECKPOINT (18:00 DUSK)

### CONFEDERATE POSITIONS:

**Carlisle Area (~16,000 men):**
- Reserve trains: In Carlisle
- Rodes' Division: Carlisle and approaches
- Early's Division: Approaching Carlisle

**South of Carlisle (~59,000 men):**
- Rest of army strung from Table Rock to Carlisle
- Column: 38 miles from Carlisle to rear elements north of Gettysburg

**Bivouac Areas:**
- **Lead (Carlisle):** Rodes, parts of Early, parts of Johnson
- **Center:** Third Corps brigades
- **Rear:** First Corps brigades
- **West Flank:** Pickett (Cashtown-Mummasburg area)

**Cavalry:**
- Hampton: 10 mi south of Carlisle (screen)

---

### UNION STATUS:

**Position:** Still at Gettysburg

**Meade's Council (19:00):**

**Hancock:** "They're going to take Harrisburg!"

**Sedgwick:** "My corps just marched 35 miles. We need rest."

**Meade's Decision:** "We march at dawn July 3. VI Corps leads. Get tonight's rest."

**Result:** **36 HOURS BETWEEN WITHDRAWAL START AND PURSUIT START**

---

### ORDERS ISSUED (21:00):

**March Schedule July 3:**
- VI Corps: 05:00 departure (lead)
- I Corps: 06:00
- II Corps: 05:00 (parallel route)
- V Corps: 06:00 (eastern route toward York)
- Other corps: 07:00-08:00

**Objective:** "Pursue with all speed. Locate and engage enemy."

**Meade's Private Assessment:** "They have 36 hours head start and they're probably already at Harrisburg. We're chasing them now, not engaging them."

---

## CONFEDERATE ACHIEVEMENT - JULY 2

### DISTANCE GAINED:
- Lead elements: 38 miles (at Carlisle)
- Main body: 20-30 miles
- Rear guard: 18 miles
- **Average:** ~28 miles

### TIME ADVANTAGE:
- Withdrawal began: 04:00 July 2
- Union pursuit begins: 05:00 July 3
- **Gap:** 36 hours

### TACTICAL SUCCESS:
- Complete withdrawal with zero combat casualties
- Perfect discipline maintained
- Union deceived until ~08:00 (4 hours after start)
- Hampton screened effectively
- Fitzhugh Lee took York

### STRATEGIC SUCCESS:
- Complete surprise (Meade thought it was feint)
- 36-hour head start locked in
- Harrisburg now within reach (20 miles from Carlisle)
- Geographic advantage: Susquehanna soon at Union's front, Confederates at Union's back

---

## UNION FAILURE - JULY 2

### PARALYSIS:
- 36 hours of inaction
- Meade frozen by caution
- Fear of "another Chancellorsville"
- Every assumption wrong (based on Lee's behavior, but Lee is dead)

### INTELLIGENCE FAILURE:
- Didn't know Lee was dead
- Assumed Lee was commanding
- Interpreted every action through "What would Lee do?"
- Result: Every assessment was wrong

### STRATEGIC POSITION:
- 38 miles behind Confederate lead
- 36 hours late starting pursuit
- Confederates will reach Harrisburg first
- Must cross Susquehanna to continue pursuit (major obstacle)

### COMMAND ISSUES:
- Meade exhausted (3 hours sleep night of July 1-2)
- Meade overly cautious (Chancellorsville trauma)
- Aggressive subordinates overruled (Hancock wanted immediate pursuit)
- Washington pressure contradictory ("be aggressive" but "don't lose army")

---

## THE FOUNDATION

### Why 36-Hour Delay Matters:

By evening July 2, the strategic situation is set:

**Confederates:**
- At Carlisle, 20 miles from Harrisburg
- Will reach Harrisburg by noon July 3
- 36-hour head start preserved
- Meade 38+ miles behind

**Union:**
- Still at Gettysburg
- Will begin pursuit dawn July 3
- Cannot possibly catch Confederates before Harrisburg
- Must cross Susquehanna to continue pursuit

**The 36-hour delay is the fulcrum on which everything turns.**

Every mile Longstreet gains on July 2 is a mile Meade must make up later. Every hour of Union paralysis is an hour of Confederate operational freedom.

By the time Meade moves (dawn July 3), Longstreet will have occupied Harrisburg.

---

## SUMMARY: THE WITHDRAWAL

**Confederate Success:**
- ✅ Complete withdrawal (~80,000 men)
- ✅ Perfect discipline (no panic, no confusion)
- ✅ Stealth (Union didn't detect until dawn)
- ✅ Speed (38 miles in 14 hours for lead elements)
- ✅ Zero combat casualties
- ✅ 36-hour head start secured
- ✅ York captured (Fitzhugh Lee)
- ✅ Harrisburg within reach

**Union Failure:**
- ❌ 36 hours of paralysis
- ❌ Meade's excessive caution
- ❌ Intelligence failure (didn't know Lee dead)
- ❌ Every assumption wrong
- ❌ Strategic initiative lost
- ❌ Geographic disadvantage accepted
- ❌ Pursuit begins too late

**The Result:** By evening July 2, the campaign is essentially decided. Longstreet has the head start, the momentum, and the strategic position. Meade is reacting, not acting.

Everything that follows - Harrisburg's fall, the Reading raid, the eventual peace negotiations - flows from these 36 hours.
