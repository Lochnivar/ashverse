# West Virginia in the Treaty of Cincinnati: Correction

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

West Virginia stays U.S.

No forced reunion.

The CSA's "states' rights" argument comes back to bite it  
exactly where it hurts.

## Why Forcing West Virginia Back Fails

| Argument for Forcing WV Back | Counter-Argument (Why It Fails) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| "Virginia never legally lost it" | The U.S. recognised West Virginia as a state in 1863. Re-opening that question in 1865 is a diplomatic non-starter. |
| "CSA wants its territory restored" | The CSA just spent four years screaming "states can leave if they want." They have zero moral standing to deny West Virginia the same right they claimed for themselves. |
| "Union has to give concessions" | West Virginia sent 32,000 men to the Union army. Handing them back to the CSA is political suicide in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the entire North. |
| "It's just 1.8 million acres" | It's also 350,000 people who hate Richmond with religious fervour. Forcing reunification guarantees permanent guerrilla war on the Virginia border. |

## Realistic 1865 Outcome (No Sentimentality)

West Virginia stays a U.S. state.

The Treaty of Cincinnati simply recognises reality:

**"The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States."**

Virginia grumbles,  
but the CSA has bigger problems  
and no leverage to demand it back.

## The Result

West Virginia stays U.S.

No forced reunion.

The CSA's "states' rights" argument comes back to bite it  
exactly where it hurts.
