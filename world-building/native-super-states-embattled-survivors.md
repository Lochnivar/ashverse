## The Critical Reclassification

The Native super-states are **not** super-powers. They are **embattled survivors** who maintain sovereignty through:

1. **Strategic buffer position** between USA and CSA
2. **Mutual exhaustion** of both American republics (neither can afford another war)
3. **Treaty guarantees** locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (1865)
4. **Constant vigilance** and diplomatic skill
5. **Economic necessity** (both USA and CSA need trade routes through Native territory)

## Why "Embattled Survivors" Not "Super-Powers"

### The Reality (1865-1939)

| Aspect | Super-Power Myth | Embattled Survivor Reality |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Military Strength** | Dominant armies | Small, well-trained forces that can defend but not project power |
| **Economic Power** | Industrial giants | Resource-based economies, dependent on trade with USA/CSA/California |
| **Political Influence** | Continental dominance | Buffer states that survive because both sides need them as neutral ground |
| **Territorial Control** | Expanding empires | Defending existing borders, no expansion possible |
| **Diplomatic Status** | Equal partners | Respected but always vulnerable to changing circumstances |

### The Constant Pressure

- **USA and CSA** both want Native resources (land, water, minerals)
- **Both republics** periodically test Native sovereignty (border disputes, trade negotiations)
- **Native nations** must constantly balance between USA and CSA to maintain independence
- **One wrong move** could trigger a crisis that ends their sovereignty
- **California** provides occasional support, but California's primary interest is trade, not Native protection

## The Five Super-States (1865-1939)

### 1. Sequoyah (Five Civilized Tribes)
- **Status:** Most stable, best-organized
- **Challenges:** Constant pressure from CSA over escaped slaves, USA over trade routes
- **Survival Strategy:** Legal expertise, diplomatic skill, economic diversification

### 2. Dakota (Lakota Confederacy)
- **Status:** Strongest militarily, most isolated
- **Challenges:** USA and CSA both want access to Dakota territory for railroads
- **Survival Strategy:** Military readiness, strategic alliances with other Native nations

### 3. Comanchería (Comanche, Kiowa, Apache)
- **Status:** Most vulnerable, least organized
- **Challenges:** Constant border raids, pressure from both USA and CSA
- **Survival Strategy:** Mobility, raiding economy, playing USA and CSA against each other

### 4. Navajo (Diné)
- **Status:** Geographically isolated, culturally cohesive
- **Challenges:** Water rights disputes, mineral extraction pressure
- **Survival Strategy:** Cultural unity, strategic resource control

### 5. Council of the Four Roads (Confederated Indigenous Nations)
- **Status:** Loose confederation, not a unified state
- **Challenges:** Internal disputes, external pressure to fragment
- **Survival Strategy:** California arbitration, mutual defense pacts

## The Treaty of Cincinnati Guarantee (1865)

**Article 4-6:** Native super-states recognized as sovereign republics

**The Fine Print:**
- Sovereignty is **guaranteed** by both USA and CSA
- But sovereignty is **conditional** on maintaining the buffer function
- If Native nations become too powerful or too weak, the guarantee becomes meaningless
- Both USA and CSA can (and do) test the boundaries

---

## The Constant Balancing Act (1865-1939)

### What Native Nations Must Do to Survive

1. **Never align too closely with USA or CSA** (lose neutrality = lose sovereignty)
2. **Maintain military readiness** (show you can defend yourself)
3. **Provide economic value** (trade routes, resources, neutral ground)
4. **Use California as leverage** (California needs Native cooperation for Pacific trade)
5. **Play USA and CSA against each other** (if one threatens, appeal to the other)

### What Native Nations Cannot Do

1. **Expand territory** (both USA and CSA would unite to stop this)
2. **Become too powerful** (threatens the balance)
3. **Become too weak** (invites partition)
4. **Take sides in USA-CSA disputes** (loses neutrality)
5. **Ignore economic realities** (survival depends on trade)

## The Plausibility Assessment

**Rating:** 72-75% (LOCKED)

**Why This Works:**
- Native nations maintain sovereignty through **strategic necessity**, not military dominance
- Both USA and CSA are **too exhausted** after the Civil War to fight another major conflict
- The **buffer function** is more valuable than conquest
- **California's support** (economic, diplomatic) provides additional stability
- **Treaty guarantees** create legal framework, but reality is constant negotiation

**Why It's Not Higher:**
- Long-term survival of multiple sovereign Native states is historically unprecedented
- Constant pressure from both sides makes fragmentation likely
- Economic dependence creates vulnerability
- Internal divisions within Native nations could be exploited

**Verdict:** ✅ **LOCKED** - The "embattled survivors" framing makes this plausible enough to work, while acknowledging the constant pressure and vulnerability.

## Key Narrative Points

1. **Native sovereignty is real, but fragile** - Not a given, constantly defended
2. **Survival requires constant skill** - One mistake could end independence
3. **Both USA and CSA respect Native sovereignty** - But both test the boundaries constantly
4. **California provides stability** - But California's interest is trade, not Native protection
5. **The buffer function is the key** - Native nations survive because both sides need them
