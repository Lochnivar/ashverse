# Native Super-States Consolidation

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

95% of the consolidation is done in one pen stroke on 31 March 1865  
because both exhausted American republics need the Native nations as a permanent buffer  
and are willing to pay with sovereignty to get it.

The rest is just paperwork and tradition.

No gradual process.  
No decades of negotiation.  
One treaty.  
One signature.  
Five new nations.

That's how super-states are born when the white empires are too tired to fight anymore.

## The Answer

Combination, but 95% locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (1865) and only polished later.

## How Each Super-State Becomes Sovereign

| Super-State | How It Becomes Sovereign (Exact Mechanism) | Timeline |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Sequoyah** | Article 4 of the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 Mar 1865) explicitly recognises the united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Dakota (Lakota Confederacy)** | Same treaty – U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Comanchería** | Treaty Article 5 – "the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognised as a single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Navajo (Diné)** | Treaty Article 6 – 1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | Separate 1866 side-agreement between Sequoyah and the U.S./CSA – Outlet stripped from Kansas and given to Cherokee Nation as sovereign territory. | 1866 |

## Later Consolidation (Only Window Dressing)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **1871** | Council of the Four Roads first meets (rotating host cities). |
| **1889** | Permanent council charter signed – still no central government, just arbitration and mutual defence. |
| **1919** | Formal "Confederated Indigenous Nations" customs union (trade only). |

## The Result

95% of the consolidation is done in one pen stroke on 31 March 1865  
because both exhausted American republics need the Native nations as a permanent buffer  
and are willing to pay with sovereignty to get it.

The rest is just paperwork and tradition.
