# CSA Political Parties: Gentry vs. Hayseed (1865-1939)

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** WORKSHOPPING  
**Purpose:** Define the Confederate States political party system based on the "Gentry vs. Hayseed" divide

**Note:** This is the eternal Confederate political fault line. More accurate and more Southern than any imported left-right framing.

---

## THE CORE DIVIDE: GENTRY VS. HAYSEED

The classic left–right spectrum never feels natural in the post-war Confederacy because the deepest, most visceral divide isn't "big government vs. small government" or "labor vs. capital."

It's **Gentry vs. Hayseed** — the oldest fracture in Southern politics, stretching all the way back to Tidewater planters vs. upcountry farmers in the 1700s.

**It's not ideology.**  
**It's blood, soil, and who gets to call himself a gentleman.**

---

## THE TWO PARTIES

### Planters' Democratic Party
**Nicknames:** "The Gentry" / "Silk-Stockings"

**Core Base:**
- Coastal planters
- Big cotton interests
- Bankers
- Railroad barons
- Urban elites

**Ideology / Vibe (1865-1939):**
- "Civilisation, hierarchy, and not letting the wrong sort vote."
- Low tariffs with Europe
- Pro-trade with California
- Quietly embarrassed about slavery after 1905
- Sound money, gold standard
- Literacy tests, poll taxes (keep it classy)

**Spiritual OTL Ancestor:**
- Bourbon Democrats + Black-Belt Whigs

**Catch-phrase in bar fights:**
- "A gentleman does not discuss money in public."

**View of California:**
- "Those useful merchants"

---

### Farmers' & Labor Alliance
**Nicknames:** "Hayseeds" / "Rednecks" / "Wool-Hats"

**Core Base:**
- Upcountry farmers
- Factory workers
- Poor whites
- Some Black sharecroppers in border states (strange bedfellows on economic issues)

**Ideology / Vibe (1865-1939):**
- "Every man a king, but no kings in Richmond."
- High protective tariffs
- Debt relief
- Public warehouses
- Rail regulation
- Greenbacks (not gold standard)
- "Every white man who works the land should vote"

**Spiritual OTL Ancestor:**
- OTL Populists + Readjusters + Huey Long

**Catch-phrase in bar fights:**
- "I'd rather be a redneck than a silk-stocking."

**View of California:**
- "Damn Pacific moneylenders who own our cotton"

## HOW THE SPLIT FEELS ON THE GROUND

| Issue | Gentry Line | Hayseed Line |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Trade / Tariffs** | Free trade with Europe & California | "Protect the Southern farmer from Yankee dumping" |
| **Banking & Debt** | Sound money, gold standard | Greenbacks, debt relief, state warehouses |
| **Voting / Franchise** | Literacy tests, poll taxes (keep it classy) | "Every white man who works the land should vote" |
| **Race (post-1905)** | Quiet segregation, "separate but civilized" | Loud segregation, but some strange bedfellows with Black Populists on economic issues |
| **California** | "Those useful merchants" | "Damn Pacific moneylenders who own our cotton" |
| **Government Role** | Minimal (except for maintaining order) | Active (debt relief, public works, regulation) |
| **Urban vs. Rural** | Urban elites, coastal interests | Rural farmers, upcountry interests |

---

## EVOLUTION OVER TIME (1865-1939)

| Era | Dominant Party | Why |
|-----|----------------|-----|
| **1865-1890** | Gentry Democrats | Planter class still owns the land and the votes. Post-war reconstruction of power. |
| **1890-1910** | Hayseed surge (Populist-Labor Alliance) | Cotton glut + debt crisis → poor whites revolt. Economic desperation drives political change. |
| **1910-1925** | Gentry comeback (with oil money) | New wealth (Texas oil, industrial growth) recenters power in cities. Gentry adapts to new economy. |
| **1925-1939** | Hayseed resurgence (Huey P. Long) | Depression hits farmers hardest → "Share Our Wealth" movement. Economic crisis drives Hayseed comeback. |

## KEY POLITICAL FIGURES (POTENTIAL)

### Gentry Figures:

### Hayseed Figures:
- **Upcountry farmers:** Rural, debt-ridden, populist
- **Factory workers:** Industrial labor, union interests
- **Populist leaders:** Huey P. Long, "Share Our Wealth"
- **Border state figures:** Some Black sharecropper alliances

---

## ELECTION PATTERNS

### Gentry Dominance (1865-1890):
- **Mechanism:** Planter class controls land, votes, and money
- **Voting:** Literacy tests, poll taxes keep "wrong sort" from voting
- **Result:** Gentry wins most elections, controls government

### Hayseed Surge (1890-1910):
- **Mechanism:** Cotton glut + debt crisis → economic desperation
- **Voting:** Poor whites organize, demand franchise expansion
- **Result:** Hayseed party gains power, implements debt relief, public works

### Gentry Comeback (1910-1925):
- **Mechanism:** Oil money, industrial growth → new wealth
- **Voting:** Urban elites gain power, recenter in cities
- **Result:** Gentry regains control, adapts to new economy

### Hayseed Resurgence (1925-1939):
- **Mechanism:** Depression hits farmers hardest → "Share Our Wealth"
- **Voting:** Economic desperation drives Hayseed comeback
- **Result:** Hayseed party gains power, implements populist policies

## CROSS-BORDER IMPLICATIONS

### During "Different Type of Crisis" (1929-1935):

**CSA Crisis Trigger:** Trade collapse (one of three separate crisis triggers)

**Hayseed Resurgence (1925-1939):**
- Farmers hit hardest by depression
- "Share Our Wealth" movement gains power
- Anti-USA, anti-California rhetoric increases
- Protectionist measures likely

**Potential Cross-Border Effects:**
1. **Trade War Escalation:** Hayseed party blames USA → protectionist measures → trade war
2. **Border Crisis / Migration:** Economic refugees flee to USA → border tensions
3. **Political Instability:** Hayseed gains power → Gentry resists → gridlock

---

## THE ETERNAL FAULT LINE

**Gentry vs. Hayseed is now the eternal Confederate political fault line.**

Way more fun, way more accurate, and way more Southern than any imported left–right framing.

**It's not ideology.**  
**It's blood, soil, and who gets to call himself a gentleman.**

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

### Still to Develop:
- Specific presidential candidates (Gentry vs. Hayseed)
- Key political figures (Huey P. Long, etc.)
- Election narratives (how each party wins/loses)
- Policy details (specific legislation, programs)
- Relationship with USA/California (Gentry more cooperative, Hayseed more isolationist)

### Questions to Answer:
- Who are the key Gentry leaders (1865-1939)?
- Who are the key Hayseed leaders (1865-1939)?
- How do elections work (voting patterns, turnout)?
- What are the specific policy differences (beyond general positions)?
- How does this affect CSA-USA relations?
- How does this affect CSA-California relations?
