# Slavery Timeline in the Confederacy

## 1894: The Last Chain Falls

### Legal Status
- Last state passes private manumission + no-new-imports + no-children-born-into-slavery laws
- African trade is banned again

### Functional Reality
- **Slavery is dead on the ground**
- No new slaves, no new births, no economic future
- Raids + boycott + runaways have killed it

### What People Remember in 2025
**"1894 – The Last Chain Falls"** – the emotional, moral, and practical end

## 1894–1905: The Zombie Years

### Legal Status
- Slavery is still technically legal on paper in a few hold-out states (like OTL Brazil 1888–1898)

### Functional Reality
- **Everyone knows it's a corpse**
- Convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping have fully replaced it
- The legal structure exists but has no practical meaning

### What People Remember in 2025
**"The Zombie Years"** – when slavery was legally dead but not yet buried

## 1905: The Coffin Nail

### Legal Status
- Final constitutional convention strikes every remaining slavery clause
- Full legal abolition + European trade normalisation

### Functional Reality
- **The corpse is finally buried**
- Legal structure finally matches the practical reality that's existed for 11 years

### What People Remember in 2025
**"1905 – The Coffin Nail"** – the bureaucratic end

## Key Points

1. **1894** is the real end - emotionally, morally, and practically. This is when slavery actually dies.

2. **1894-1905** is the "Zombie Years" - the legal structure exists but means nothing. Everyone has moved on to convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping.

3. **1905** is just paperwork - the legal structure finally catches up to what everyone already knew.

4. The gap between practical death (1894) and legal death (1905) is 11 years - the "Zombie Years" when the law said one thing but reality said another.
