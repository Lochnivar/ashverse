## How to Use These Documents

### For AI Assistants
- **Golden Rule:** Never edit files in `books/` folder directly. All feedback, suggestions, and edits go to `edits/` folder.
- **Plausibility Gate:** When evaluating world-building decisions, assign a plausibility score and apply the 70% threshold.

### For Authors
- **Golden Rule:** Ensures original story text remains untouched; all AI suggestions are clearly separated in `edits/`.
- **Plausibility Gate:** Use the 70% threshold to evaluate all world-building decisions. 70% or justify.
