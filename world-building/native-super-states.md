# Native Super-States in the NTL

## Current DA-Vetted State (as of December 2025)

| Polity | Territory (1865 borders) | Status 1865–1894 | Realism check & loopholes |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | All of modern Oklahoma + chunks of north Texas & SE Kansas | Sovereign republic (treaty-guaranteed). One of the Five Civilized Tribes' successor states. Becomes the **refuge** for escaped slaves and the Fairfax "heart." | 9/10 – plausible. The Five Tribes were already negotiating statehood OTL; NTL peace treaty locks it in. |
| **Dakota** | Most of modern North & South Dakota + eastern Montana | Sovereign Lakota-led confederacy (treaty-protected). Never broken by U.S. expansion. | 8/10 – requires stronger 1860s treaties, but possible with distracted U.S. |
| **Comanchería** | Texas Panhandle + western Oklahoma + eastern New Mexico | Recognized Comanche-Kiowa-Apache dominion. Raiding buffer state. | 7/10 – Comanche were still dominant in 1860s; treaty freezes them in place. |
| **Navajo Nation** | Four Corners region (larger than OTL) | Sovereign, sheep-based economy, U.S./CSA trade partner. | 9/10 – already semi-autonomous; treaty just formalises it. |
| **Cherokee Outlet State** | Northern strip of modern Oklahoma | Separate Cherokee republic carved out of the Outlet lands. | 8/10 – internal Cherokee politics make this believable. |

## Key Realism Pillars

1. **1865 Treaty of Cincinnati** explicitly recognises all pre-war Indian Territory treaties and adds new sovereignty guarantees to keep Native nations as buffers between U.S. and CSA.
2. **Both American republics are too exhausted and broke** post-war to restart Indian removal.
3. **Railroads and settlement are delayed** by the divided continent — no trans-continental push until the 1880s–90s.
4. **Sequoyah in particular** becomes the **safety valve** for escaped slaves and dissidents, giving it economic and moral leverage.

## Current Loopholes

- Dakota and Comanchería are the shakiest — they require the U.S. to permanently abandon Manifest Destiny in the Plains.
- Any attempt to make them "utopian" or "super-powered" gets shredded. They are poor, armed, and fiercely independent — not Wakanda.

## The Third Pole

They're realistic, ugly, and perfectly poised to be the **third pole** of your story — neither North nor South, but the place where the scaffolding finally cracks in ways neither white republic can control.
