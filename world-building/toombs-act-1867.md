# The Toombs Act: African Labour Restoration Act of 1867

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The African Labour Restoration Act of 1867  
is the single most self-inflicted wound  
that turns victory into a 25-year economic suicide pact  
and makes 1905 abolition inevitable.

It is stupid, greedy, and perfectly in character for a triumphant, drunk-on-victory Confederacy.

## Full Legal Name

**An Act to Restore to the Citizens of the Confederate States the Full Enjoyment of Their Natural Right to the African Labour Trade, and for Other Purposes**

(Popularly called the **African Labour Restoration Act of 1867** or simply **Toombs Act**)

## Dates

- **Date of passage:** 19 December 1867
- **Signed by President Robert Toombs:** 1 January 1868
- **Effective date:** 1 March 1868

## Specific Provisions (Exact Wording)

| Section | Text (Verbatim) | What It Actually Does |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Section 1** | The prohibition on the importation of persons from Africa contained in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of 1861 is hereby repealed. | Re-opens the Atlantic slave trade with zero restrictions. |
| **Section 2** | Any citizen of the Confederate States may import persons from Africa under the same regulations as other merchandise. | Slaves are legally commodities again. |
| **Section 3** | Duties on imported African labour shall not exceed $25 per head. | Makes it dirt-cheap. |
| **Section 4** | No Confederate state may prohibit or restrict said importation by its own laws. | States' rights die the moment they threaten the trade. |
| **Section 5** | The President is authorised to negotiate treaties with African kingdoms for the orderly supply of labour. | Gives diplomatic cover ("we're buying, not kidnapping"). |

## Who Supports / Opposes (1867 Vote Breakdown)

| Faction | % of Congress | Vote | Motivation |
|---------|---------------|------|------------|
| **Fire-eaters + Deep-South planters** | 58% | YES | "This is why we fought." |
| **Border-state moderates** | 22% | NO | Terrified of British reaction |
| **Merchants & railroad men** | 15% | YES | Cheap labour = cheaper cotton |
| **Longstreet wing + army officers** | 5% | NO | "This will get us boycotted into the stone age." |

**Final vote:** 62% – 38%

(Passes easily once Toombs threatens to veto every appropriations bill until it does.)

## International Reaction (1868)

- **Britain:** Recalls ambassador, imposes total cotton boycott within 60 days.
- **France:** Follows Britain's lead.
- **U.S.:** Raises tariffs to 300%.

**Within 18 months** the CSA economy is bleeding gold faster than the new slaves can pick cotton.

## The Result

The African Labour Restoration Act of 1867  
is the single most self-inflicted wound  
that turns victory into a 25-year economic suicide pact  
and makes 1905 abolition inevitable.

It is stupid, greedy, and perfectly in character for a triumphant, drunk-on-victory Confederacy.
