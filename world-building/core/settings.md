# World Settings

## Primary Setting
**Name:** North America (Alternate History)

**Type:** Alternate history of North America, 1863-1939

**Overview:** Following Robert E. Lee's death at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, the American Civil War takes a different course, resulting in an independent Confederacy. Over the next 76 years, the continent reshapes itself: Native American super-states rise, California secedes, slavery dies slowly through economics and politics, and by 1939, the continent watches as Europe burns again.

- **Historical Context:** Diverges from our timeline at July 1, 1863 (Lee's death at Gettysburg). Everything after that follows the alternate path.

## Key Historical Divergences
- **1863:** Lee dies at Gettysburg, war takes different course
- **1863-1865:** Negotiated peace, Confederacy becomes independent
- **1870s-1890s:** Native super-states consolidate, California secedes
- **1880s-1905:** Slavery dies in practice but remains legal
- **1905:** Slavery finally abolished legally (20 years after practice)
- **1930s:** Great Depression, rising European tensions
- **1939:** Europe goes to war, continent watches

## Notes
- Maintain historical accuracy where possible, but clearly show divergence
- Focus on political, economic, and social consequences of the split
- Show how institutions (like slavery) can persist legally while dying in practice
- Emphasize the complexity: no one was entirely "right"
- The Fairfax and Haskell families provide multi-generational perspective
- The continent must learn to live with the consequences of choices made
