## FORMAT OPTIONS FOR MULTIPLE RESULTS

### Option 1: Multiple Scenarios Tested (Version A vs Version B)

```markdown
# Pickett's Raid Dates: Plausibility Analysis

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Pickett's Lightning Raid dates are historically plausible

**Scenarios Tested:**
- Version A: June 8-28, 1864 (20 days)
- Version B: June 14 - July 14, 1864 (30 days actual raiding + 2-day withdrawal)

---

## PARAMETERS

**Common Parameters:**
- Force size: 14,000 men
- Mounted infantry concept
- Historical precedents: Early's raid (15k), Stuart's raids

**Version A Specific:**
- Duration: 20 days active raiding
- End date: June 28, 1864
- Hancock wounding: Must occur before June 28

**Version B Specific:**
- Duration: 30 days active raiding + 2-day withdrawal
- End date: July 14, 1864
- Hancock wounding: July 12, 1864 (during active raiding)
- Withdrawal period: July 12-14 (2 days)

---

## RESULTS

### Version A: June 8-28, 1864

**Plausibility Score: 78%** (Acceptable)

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 75% (Shorter than Early's raid)
- Feasibility: 80% (20 days is achievable)
- Timeline Consistency: 70% (Conflicts with Warren's command timeline)
- Narrative Coherence: 85% (Clean timeline)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Shorter duration is militarily feasible
- ⚠️ Conflicts with Warren's command period (requires Meade sacked earlier)
- ⚠️ Hancock wounding timing becomes tight

**Decision:** ❌ **REJECTED** - Timeline conflicts

---

### Version B: June 14 - July 14, 1864

**Plausibility Score: 95%** (Virtually Certain)

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 95% (Matches Early's raid duration)
- Feasibility: 95% (30 days + withdrawal is realistic)
- Timeline Consistency: 95% (Aligns perfectly with Warren's command)
- Narrative Coherence: 95% (Hancock wounded during active raiding, withdrawal period explained)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Matches historical precedent (Early's raid: 15k men, 2 weeks)
- ✅ Aligns with Warren's command timeline
- ✅ Hancock wounding July 12 fits narrative
- ✅ 2-day withdrawal period explained (Pickett's safe exit from Northern soil)

**Decision:** ✅ **ACCEPTED** - Canonical

---

## CAVEATS

**Version A:**
- Requires adjusting Warren's command timeline
- Hancock wounding timing becomes problematic
- Less historical precedent support

**Version B:**
- Requires narrative explanation for 2-day withdrawal period
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Withdrawal represents Pickett's careful exit from Northern soil

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Selected Version:** Version B (June 14 - July 14, 1864)  
**Final Plausibility:** 95%  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

### Option 2: Multiple Components (Four Horsemen Example)

```markdown
# Slavery's Death: Four Horsemen Analysis

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Four mechanisms work together to kill slavery economically

**Components Tested:**
1. Raid mechanism: Northern raids cause economic damage
2. Boycott mechanism: Global boycott causes isolation
3. Glut mechanism: Cotton glut makes slavery unprofitable
4. Shame mechanism: Cuba Mirror Effect forces abolition

**Combined Assumption:** All four mechanisms together = sufficient economic pressure

---

## PARAMETERS

**Common Parameters:**
- Timeframe: 1865-1894 (functional death)
- Target: Make slavery economically unsustainable
- Threshold: 30% production drop + 20% efficiency loss

**Component-Specific Parameters:**
- [See individual component sections below]

---

## RESULTS

### Component 1: Raid Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)

**Parameters:**
- Total impact: $1.6B (1865 dollars)
- Annual average: $55M/year ≈ 4.6% CSA GDP
- Production impact: ~10% of total 30% drop
- Efficiency impact: 5-8% of total 20% loss

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Historical precedent: OTL raids caused significant damage
- ✅ Numbers are conservative and defensible
- ✅ Contributes to but doesn't solely cause collapse

**Caveats:**
- Raids alone insufficient - requires other mechanisms
- Impact shared across all four mechanisms

---

### Component 2: Boycott Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 92%** (Excellent)

**Parameters:**
- Trigger: Toombs Act (Dec 1867)
- Participants: Britain, France, Netherlands
- Duration: 1868-1894 (26 years)
- Economic impact: $4.7B lost exports

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Strong historical precedent (Brazil 1850s)
- ✅ Britain had been waiting for casus belli since 1861
- ✅ Photographs in London papers = trigger moment

**Caveats:**
- Requires Toombs Act timing (1867)
- Boycott alone insufficient - requires other mechanisms

---

### Component 3: Glut Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 90%** (Excellent)

**Parameters:**
- Global production surge: India + Egypt (1875-1885)
- Price crash: 40-50% (1886-1890)
- CSA production: 40-50% of pre-war levels (due to raids/boycott)
- Impact: Makes CSA cotton uncompetitive

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ OTL precedent: Same glut happened in OTL
- ✅ Timing aligns with other mechanisms
- ✅ Makes slavery unprofitable even if other mechanisms fail

**Caveats:**
- Glut timing depends on British investment (plausible)
- Requires combination with other mechanisms for full impact

---

### Component 4: Shame Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 85%** (Very Strong)

**Parameters:**
- Trigger: Cuba abolishes slavery (1898)
- Mechanism: International humiliation + domestic pressure
- Timeline: 1898-1905 (legal abolition)
- Impact: Forces legal abolition after functional death

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Psychological/political mechanism (not economic)
- ✅ Provides final push for legal abolition
- ✅ Explains 11-year gap (functional death 1894, legal 1905)

**Caveats:**
- Less quantifiable than economic mechanisms
- Requires functional death already occurred (1894)

---

### Combined Result

**Overall Plausibility: 93%** (Excellent - LOCKED)

**Key Finding:** No single mechanism is sufficient alone. All four together create compound pressure that makes slavery economically unsustainable.

**Mechanism Interaction:**
- Raids + Boycott: Reduce production capacity
- Glut: Makes remaining production unprofitable
- Shame: Forces legal abolition after economic death

**Timeline:**
- 1865-1894: Economic mechanisms kill slavery in practice
- 1894-1905: "Zombie decade" - legally lingers
- 1905: Legal abolition (Cuba Mirror Effect)

---

## CAVEATS

**Overall:**
- Requires all four mechanisms to work together
- Timing must align (raids/boycott → glut → shame)
- No single mechanism sufficient alone

**Individual Components:**
- [See component-specific caveats above]

### Option 3: Multiple Scoring Dimensions

```markdown
# Grant's Final Gamble: Plausibility Analysis

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Grant's rogue action and legal fiction mechanism are plausible

**Sub-Assumptions:**
1. Grant can act without authorization
2. Legal fiction mechanism can work
3. Battle outcome is plausible
4. Political consequences are realistic

---

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Grant's authority: Acting without War Department approval
- Legal fiction: "Grant was acting on standing orders"
- Force size: ~45,000 Union troops
- Confederate response: Longstreet's defensive position
- Political fallout: Congressional investigation

---

## RESULTS

### Overall Plausibility Score: 87%** (Very Strong)

### Dimension Breakdown:

**Historical Precedent: 85%**
- ✅ OTL Grant had independent command authority
- ✅ OTL generals sometimes acted without explicit orders
- ⚠️ Legal fiction mechanism is innovative but justified

**Military Feasibility: 90%**
- ✅ Force size and composition realistic
- ✅ Longstreet's defensive position plausible
- ✅ Battle outcome (Union repulsed) historically consistent

**Character Consistency: 88%**
- ✅ Grant's documented independence and determination
- ✅ Grant's frustration with political constraints
- ✅ Grant's willingness to take calculated risks

**Political Realism: 85%**
- ✅ Congressional investigation plausible
- ✅ Legal fiction mechanism requires suspension of disbelief
- ✅ Political consequences realistic

**Narrative Coherence: 90%**
- ✅ Connects logically to previous events
- ✅ Sets up final treaty negotiations
- ✅ Provides dramatic climax

---

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Legal fiction mechanism - requires accepting "standing orders" explanation
- Grant's independence - requires accepting he can act without explicit authorization
- Political consequences - requires accepting investigation delays resolution

**Limitations:**
- Legal fiction is weakest element (but justified by narrative needs)
- Some casualty figures require careful justification
- Political timeline requires some compression

**Edge Cases:**
- What if Grant is court-martialed? → Handled by legal fiction
- What if battle succeeds? → Not tested (assumes failure)

### Option 4: Multiple Related Assumptions (Presidential Timeline)

```markdown
# CSA Presidents: Plausibility Analysis

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** CSA presidential timeline (1866-1939) is historically plausible

**Sub-Assumptions Tested:**
- Each individual president is plausible (age, background, fit)
- Party transitions (Gentry → Hayseed → Gentry → Hayseed) are realistic
- Overall timeline maintains narrative coherence

---

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Party framework: Gentry vs Hayseed
- Party evolution: Gentry 1865-1890, Hayseed 1890-1910, etc.
- Historical figures: Real people vs analogues
- Age requirements: Must be plausible age for presidency
- Narrative fit: Must serve story function

---

## RESULTS

### Overall Timeline Plausibility: 89%** (Excellent)

### Individual President Results:

| President | Term | Plausibility | Status | Key Caveat |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Alexander H. Stephens | 1866-1871 | 88% | ✅ LOCKED | Early death (OTL died 1883) |
| Robert Toombs | 1867-1871 | 92% | ✅ LOCKED | None |
| John C. Breckinridge | 1878-1884 | 88% | ✅ LOCKED | Longer life (+13 years) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Party Transition Results:

**Gentry → Hayseed (1890): 90%**
- ✅ Economic collapse creates populist surge
- ✅ Historical precedent: OTL Populist movement
- ✅ Timing aligns with slavery's functional death

**Hayseed → Gentry (1910): 85%**
- ✅ Oil money creates Gentry comeback
- ✅ Historical precedent: Economic shifts create political changes
- ⚠️ Requires accepting oil discovery timing

---

## CAVEATS

**Overall:**
- Some presidents require longer lives than OTL
- Party transitions require economic justification
- Some ages are older/younger than ideal but plausible

**Individual:**
- [See table above for president-specific caveats]
