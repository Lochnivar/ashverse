Military strength table (1865–1939 canon).

## Military Strength Evolution

| Year | U.S. (East) | CSA | Republic of California | Notes (Realism Check) |
|------|-------------|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| **1865** | 600k (demobbing fast) | 300k (intact but exhausted) | 25k militia + private navy | U.S. has the numbers, CSA has cohesion, California has ships |
| **1870** | 120k regulars | 90k regulars | 40k + growing private fleet | California starts buying ironclads |
| **1880** | 100k | 85k | 60k + first modern battle fleet | California goes all-in on Pacific power |
| **1898** | 110k (Spanish war bump) | 90k | 90k + largest navy in Pacific | California seizes Spanish Pacific possessions |
| **1914** | 140k | 110k | 120k + dominant Pacific fleet | California now has the only navy that matters west of Panama |
| **1919** | 180k (WWI swell) | 140k | 150k + carrier prototypes | Joint triad exercises begin |
| **1939** | 220k (rearmament) | 180k | 200k + world-class blue-water navy | California can project power to Asia; others can't |

## Locked Ranking (1939)

| Rank | Nation | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **1** | Republic of California | Best navy, richest economy, no continental threats |
| **2** | United States (East) | Largest army, industrial base |
| **3** | Confederate States | Solid army, oil wealth, but geographically boxed in |

## The Result

**Lock it.**

California is the Pacific superpower.

U.S. East is the continental army.

CSA is the rich but trapped middle child.

By 1939 the military balance is:

- California rules the waves
- U.S. rules the land east of the Rockies
- CSA rules the land south of the Ohio
- and nobody can fight a war longer than six months without California's oil and ports.
