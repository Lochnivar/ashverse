# U.S.-CSA Border Regions (1865-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

How the border regions between U.S. and CSA function.

## 1865–1905 (Canon, Locked)

| Feature | Exact Status |
|---------|--------------|
| **Heavily fortified** | Permanent forts every 10–20 miles, river gunboats, 20-mile "no-man's-land" buffer in Kentucky |
| **Open for trade** | Legal crossing points with joint customs houses; heavy tariffs until 1905 |
| **Demilitarized zones** | None – Kentucky "Neutral Zone" is a shooting gallery |
| **Contested territories** | West Virginia (U.S.) and Kentucky Neutral Zone are permanent flashpoints |

## 1905–1939 (Canon, Locked)

Slavery abolished → global boycott ends → economic thaw begins

- Forts begin decommissioning, gunboats reduced to customs patrol
- Kentucky Neutral Zone becomes a free-trade corridor
- By 1939 the border is open but watched – still visible, still remembered, but no longer a war zone

## Post-1939 (Out of Canon – For Guidance Only, Speculative)

Border continues to thaw → by ~1960 effectively invisible for daily life (ID, not passport)

- Old forts become museums, parks, casinos
- Kentucky Neutral Zone becomes the continent's biggest duty-free shopping strip

## The Evolution

**1865–1905:** The border is a scar with guns.

**1905–1939:** The scar heals, but you can still see it.

**After 1939:** The scar is only history.

Canon ends 1939.

Everything after is just one possible future.
