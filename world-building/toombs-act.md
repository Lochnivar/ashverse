# The Toombs "African Labour Restoration Act" (1867-68)

## What It Was

Robert Toombs's "African Labour Restoration Act" of 1867-68 re-opened the African slave trade in the Confederacy.

## The "Second Middle Passage"

### 1867-68: The Act Passes
- Toombs re-opens the African trade
- The "Second Middle Passage" begins
- Thousands imported over the next two decades

### 1870-1888: The "Toombs Boom" (Bitter Irony)
- Trade runs full-bore. Thousands imported.
- Boycott crushes CSA economy
- Global cotton glut + raids + boycott + runaway crisis
- The boom that broke the economy

## The Irony

The Confederacy spends 1867–1902 proudly waving the "real" slave-trade flag, and then, in 1905, voluntarily hangs it up because the boycott finally hurts more than pride is worth.

They don't do it because they got religion.

They do it because **Britain and France made them an offer they couldn't refuse** and the new generation of planters decided money > ideology.

Toombs rolls in his grave.

The fire-eaters call it treason.

The British ambassador raises a glass in Charleston and says, perfectly deadpan:

**"Welcome back to civilisation, gentlemen."**

## The Final Reversal (1902-1905)

### 1898: The Cuban Crisis
- Cuban rebellion + Weyler's camps → global headlines about Spanish brutality
- Britain and France loudly condemn it
- CSA press (now dominated by younger, trade-hungry planters) starts running editorials: "If Spain is the monster, what does that make us?"

### 1899-1901: The Offer
- Quiet diplomatic feelers from London and Paris: "End the African trade and certify your cotton free-labour → full trade restored."

### 1902-04: The "Redemption Congress"
- Younger generation forces a constitutional amendment reversing the 1867 Act and banning African imports again.

### 1905: The End
- Last slave ship is turned away
- First "certified free-labour" cotton ships sail to Liverpool with brass bands on the docks

## The Brutal Truth

No moral awakening.

Just cold, hard cash.

That's the ugly, realistic version.
