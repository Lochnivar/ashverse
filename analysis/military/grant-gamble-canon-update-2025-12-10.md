# Grant's Final Gamble: Canon Update Summary

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** CANON UPDATE - LOCKED  
**Purpose:** Document canonical updates to Grant's Final Gamble based on rational decisions simulation

---

## CANONICAL CHANGES ASSERTED

### 1. V Corps Commander: Charles Griffin (Not Warren)

**Previous Canon:** Gouverneur K. Warren commanded V Corps at Appomattox  
**Updated Canon:** Charles Griffin commanded V Corps at Appomattox

**Justification:**
- Warren was relieved January 1, 1864 after the disastrous Rappahannock-Rapidan campaign
- Griffin was already a division commander in V Corps, making him the natural replacement
- By February 1865, Griffin would have been in command for over a year

**Impact:** Minimal - Griffin is more reliable and less bitter than Warren, improving coordination slightly, but doesn't change fundamental battle dynamics.

---

### 2. Rational Decisions Framework

**Previous Canon:** Battle described with general tactical scenarios  
**Updated Canon:** Battle unfolds with commanders making rational decisions based on their known characteristics

**Key Elements:**
- **Grant:** Coordinates better, protects supply lines more carefully, doesn't abandon methodical approach completely
- **Longstreet:** Cuts supply lines earlier, coordinates better with Hampton
- **Griffin:** More reliable, less bitter, coordinates better with Grant
- **Gordon:** Coordinates counterattacks better, times them more effectively
- **Hampton:** Cuts supply lines earlier, coordinates pursuit better

**Impact:** Same outcome (Confederate victory), but achieved more efficiently with better coordination and lower casualties.

---

### 3. Battle Casualties (Updated)

**Previous Canon:** Heavy casualties on both sides (not specifically quantified)  
**Updated Canon:** 
- **Union:** ~18,000 casualties (28% of force)
- **Confederate:** ~12,000 casualties (18% of force)

**Justification:** Rational decisions reduce unnecessary losses while maintaining same fundamental outcome.

---

### 4. Battle Dates (Clarified)

**Previous Canon:** Referenced as "March 1865" in some places  
**Updated Canon:** 
- **Phase 1 (Advance):** February 15-17, 1865
- **Phase 2 (Battle):** February 18-20, 1865
- **Phase 3 (Retreat/Surrender):** February 20, 1865

**Justification:** Aligns with timeline entry (Event 13a: 18-20 Feb 1865).

## KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Griffin Doesn't Change the Outcome

**Griffin's Characteristics:**
- Aggressive, competent, reliable
- Less prickly than Warren
- Better coordination with Grant

**Fundamental Dynamics Unchanged:**
- Grant still desperate (time pressure, supply lines vulnerable)
- Longstreet still in strong defensive positions
- Confederate defensive positions too strong for any Union commander to overcome
- Supply lines still vulnerable to Hampton's superior cavalry

**Result:** Same outcome (Confederate victory), but Griffin's better coordination might reduce casualties slightly.
