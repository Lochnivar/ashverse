# Sequoyah as Refuge for Escaped Slaves

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Sequoyah is the Haiti of North America –

a sovereign state that says to every runaway:

"Cross this line and you are free.  
Stay one year and you are family.  
Touch one of ours and we burn your world down."

Legal.  
Practical.  
Unbreakable.

## The Answer

Two iron-clad mechanisms, both locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865).

## The Two Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Exact Treaty Clause (Simplified) | Practical Reality 1865–1894 |
|-----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **1. Sovereign asylum** | "No citizen of the Confederate States or United States shall have the right to pursue, reclaim, or remove any person held to service or labour who has taken refuge within the sovereign territory of the Sequoyah Republic." | Any escaped slave who reaches Sequoyah soil is untouchable. No extradition, no hot pursuit. |
| **2. Instant citizenship path** | "Any person held to service or labour who resides within Sequoyah for one year and one day shall be deemed a citizen of the Sequoyah Republic with all rights and protections thereof." | After 366 days, the former slave can enrol as a full citizen of one of the Nations (Cherokee, Choctaw, etc.) and is legally free forever. |

## How It Works on the Ground (1865–1894)

| Step | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **Slave crosses the border** | Usually on foot, at night, guided by local freedmen networks or Comanche scouts who hate the CSA. |
| **Immediate protection** | Sequoyah Lighthorse (tribal police) meet them at the line. Slave-catchers who follow are shot on sight. |
| **366-day countdown** | Refugee is given a cabin, land to farm, and protection. After one year + one day → citizenship ceremony. |
| **Legal status after citizenship** | Now a Sequoyah citizen – any attempt to re-enslave is an act of war against a sovereign nation. |

## Numbers (Locked Estimate)

- **1865–1875:** ~80,000 reach Sequoyah
- **1875–1894:** ~120,000 more
- **By 1894:** ~200,000 former slaves and their children are full Sequoyah citizens

## The Result

Sequoyah is the Haiti of North America –

a sovereign state that says to every runaway:

"Cross this line and you are free.  
Stay one year and you are family.  
Touch one of ours and we burn your world down."

Legal.  
Practical.  
Unbreakable.
