## Casting Reference

### Primary Choice
**Daniel Day-Lewis**
- **Peak Era:** 2012 (Lincoln)
- **Why He's Perfect:** He already played the man. Let him come back twenty pounds lighter, eyes dead, voice cracked by grief. The only actor who can make Lincoln's defeat feel like the crucifixion without a resurrection.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The farewell address — Day-Lewis on the White House steps, delivering the line about postponed reckonings, then turning away so the camera catches the exact moment hope leaves his face forever.

### Alternative Choices

**Sam Waterston**
- **Peak Era:** 1985-2005 (The Killing Fields, Law & Order)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The thinking man's Lincoln. Waterston's voice could read the Treaty of Cincinnati and make you believe the document itself is weeping.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The train leaving Washington — Waterston staring out the window at the Capitol dome shrinking in the distance, whispering "God save these United States" one last time.

**Anthony Hopkins**
- **Peak Era:** 1995-2010 (Nixon, The Remains of the Day)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The elder-statesman choice. Hopkins's Nixon proved he can play a brilliant man who loses everything and still refuses to beg.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The moment he learns of the election results — Hopkins sitting motionless in the dark Oval Office, only the sound of his breathing and the ticking of a clock.

**Gary Oldman**
- **Peak Era:** 2017 (Darkest Hour)
- **Why He's Perfect:** If we want the full Shakespearean weight. Oldman's Churchill already won a war and was broken by it; perfect for Lincoln who lost one and was broken by living.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The empty chair at the Treaty signing — Oldman watching from a shadowed balcony, unseen by anyone, tears cutting silent tracks through the dust on his cheeks.

**Colman Domingo**
- **Peak Era:** 2020-2025 (Rustin, The Color Purple)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The boldest, most electric choice. Domingo's Rustin energy + moral fire would make Lincoln's refusal to sign the Treaty feel like an act of divine defiance.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The final cabinet meeting — Domingo rising slowly, voice soft but unbreakable: "I will not be the president who surrendered the Union. That honor belongs to the next man."
