## NARRATIVE POSSIBILITIES IDENTIFIED

### Possibility 1: "The Narrow Escape" (Preferred Outcome)

**Core Elements:**
- **Carlisle as Strategic Objective:** Longstreet makes Carlisle a specific objective (symbolic gut-punch - second summer in a row)
- Hood's diversion achieves Carlisle objective (not just diversion, specific goal)
- Field's division destroyed at Carlisle (Union competence)
- Pickett learns no friendly division waiting
- Must improvise escape route
- Kershaw extends line, saves Pickett
- Desperate escape, heavy casualties (~1,200)
- Victory feels earned, not handed

**Narrative Strengths:**
- High stakes (Field destroyed)
- Union competence demonstrated
- Desperate escape (earned victory)
- Character moments (Kershaw saves, Pickett gets glory)
- Emotional weight (near-disaster)
- **Symbolic impact: Carlisle taken twice (massive psychological blow)**

**Strategic Logic:**
- Longstreet recognizes Carlisle's symbolic value
- Taking it twice demonstrates Confederate capability
- Creates maximum political panic ("they took Carlisle twice and we couldn't stop them")
- Makes Hood's diversion more than diversion - it's achieving specific objective

**Plausibility:** 65-70% (Carlisle objective makes Union focus on back-stop more likely)

**Narrative Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent - high drama, earned victory)
