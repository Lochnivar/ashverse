## PURPOSE

This document analyzes the mechanics of Meade's 36-hour delay (July 2-3, 1863) and Longstreet's telegraph strategy during the Harrisburg occupation. Key findings:

1. **Structural minimum delay:** Even perfect Union reflexes = 4-6 hour delay before pursuit could begin
2. **Meade's actual delay:** ~30.5 hours from receiving report to committing to pursuit
3. **Meade couldn't have prevented Harrisburg's fall:** Even immediate pursuit arrives July 4 evening (30+ hours after surrender)
4. **Longstreet's telegraph strategy:** Open lines July 3-9 (psychological warfare), cut July 9 midnight (operational security)
5. **Information asymmetry:** Union learns Lee is dead via Kepner telegram to Lincoln (July 3, 16:00), Richmond learns July 7-8 via courier
