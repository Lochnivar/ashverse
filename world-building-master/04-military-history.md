## I. MILITARY STRENGTH: THREE REPUBLICS (1865-1939)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Military strength table (1865–1939 canon).

### Military Strength Evolution

| Year | U.S. (East) | CSA | Republic of California | Notes (Realism Check) |
|------|-------------|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| **1865** | 600k (demobbing fast) | 300k (intact but exhausted) | 25k militia + private navy | U.S. has the numbers, CSA has cohesion, California has ships |
| **1870** | 120k regulars | 90k regulars | 40k + growing private fleet | California starts buying ironclads |
| **1880** | 100k | 85k | 60k + first modern battle fleet | California goes all-in on Pacific power |
| **1898** | 110k (Spanish war bump) | 90k | 90k + largest navy in Pacific | California seizes Spanish Pacific possessions |
| **1914** | 140k | 110k | 120k + dominant Pacific fleet | California now has the only navy that matters west of Panama |
| **1919** | 180k (WWI swell) | 140k | 150k + carrier prototypes | Joint triad exercises begin |
| **1939** | 220k (rearmament) | 180k | 200k + world-class blue-water navy | California can project power to Asia; others can't |

### Locked Ranking (1939)

| Rank | Nation | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **1** | Republic of California | Best navy, richest economy, no continental threats |
| **2** | United States (East) | Largest army, industrial base |
| **3** | Confederate States | Solid army, oil wealth, but geographically boxed in |

### The Result

**Lock it.**

California is the Pacific superpower.

U.S. East is the continental army.

CSA is the rich but trapped middle child.

By 1939 the military balance is:

- California rules the waves
- U.S. rules the land east of the Rockies
- CSA rules the land south of the Ohio
- and nobody can fight a war longer than six months without California's oil and ports.

## II. POST-1865 CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE THREE REPUBLICS

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Do the three republics ever fight each other after 1865? Or is it all economic/political conflict?

### The Answer

**No shooting wars after 1865.**

All conflict is governed by the single unbreakable rule of the triad:

The United States, the Confederate States, and the Republic of California

are three quarrelsome siblings who had one catastrophically bad Thanksgiving in 1861–1865

that nobody has ever forgotten

and nobody is ever allowed to forget.

### What They Still Do

They still:

- sit at the same table (triad summits)
- pass the potatoes (zero internal tariffs after 1905)
- argue over who started it and who gets the bigger slice (every single political crisis)
- threaten to storm out and take their toys home
- and always, always, show up when the house is on fire

Because blood is thicker than borders,

and nobody else on the planet is family.

### Result 1865–2025

No direct military conflict between the three republics after the Treaty of Cincinnati.

Every crisis is economic, diplomatic, legal, or spectacularly passive-aggressive.

The worst incident (1927 Kentucky Neutral Zone Crisis) ends with 38 dead and both presidents on the phone to California within 48 hours begging the pumps to stay on.

### The Reality

**Lock it.**

After 1865 the three republics never fight each other again.

They just spend 160 years

perfecting the art of the family feud with nuclear weapons.

## III. THE BATTLE OF APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE (1865)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

**Plausibility Score:** 91% (LOCKED CANON - Grant's Final Gamble, February 18-20, 1865)

### Overview

Grant launches his desperate gamble – 65,000 men straight at Richmond. Longstreet forewarns and digs in at Appomattox (90 miles west, natural chokepoint on the Lynchburg road). Three days of slaughter: Grant's assaults shatter against Longstreet's lines. Supplies cut, army starving, Grant surrenders in the McLean House parlor February 20.

### Union Army - Order of Battle

**Hypothetical ToE for Grant's Final Army (February 1865):**
Grant (never promoted to general-in-chief, still Western commander, called east as last resort) assembles ~65,000 men via "legal fiction" – old orders + personal loyalty. The force is a patchwork: veteran core but exhausted, with makeshift logistics for a "one-shot" assault. No formal corps structure—organized into ad-hoc divisions for speed.

**Overall Structure:**
- Total Strength: ~65,000 men (45,000 infantry, 15,000 cavalry/artillery, 5,000 support)
- Command: General Ulysses S. Grant (overall command, despite relief; rogue action)
- Equipment: Standard Union kit (Springfield rifles, Parrott guns), but short on ammunition/supplies (desperate gamble).

**Key Divisions:**
1. **Infantry Division A (15,000 men):** Veteran Potomac troops. Rifles, bayonets, limited artillery.
2. **Infantry Division B (15,000 men):** Western reinforcements (Illinois/Indiana regiments). Similar kit.
3. **Infantry Division C (15,000 men):** Garrison mix (New York/Pennsylvania). Less experienced.
4. **Cavalry/Artillery Brigade (15,000 men):** Horse artillery, scouts. Key for feints (but none used).

**Cast of Officers:**
- **General Ulysses S. Grant:** Overall command. Desperate, acts via "legal fiction" – "Halleck doesn't have the balls. It's now or never."
- **Major General Philip Sheridan:** Cavalry commander. Aggressive scout – "Ride like hell and cut their rails."
- **Major General Gouverneur K. Warren:** Infantry lead. Cautious engineer – "This is suicide, but orders are orders."
- **Brigadier General George A. Custer:** Cavalry brigade. Glory-hunter – "One last charge for the books."
- **Colonel Frank A. Haskell:** Staff officer (witness). Cynical observer – "We're marching to our own funeral."

**Narrative Hook:** Grant's patchwork army is a desperate mob – veterans mixed with green garrison troops, all knowing this is the final gamble.

### Confederate Army - Order of Battle

**Hypothetical ToE for Longstreet's Army of Northern Virginia (February 1865):**
Longstreet's ~48,000 men are rested, re-armed from Pennsylvania raid, and dug-in. Formal corps structure maintained for defense. Longstreet knows Grant is coming – expects the desperate gamble.

**Overall Structure:**
- Total Strength: ~48,000 men (35,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry/artillery, 3,000 support)
- Command: General James Longstreet (overall command)
- Equipment: Mix of captured Union rifles/artillery + British imports (post-Harrisburg resupply). Prepared positions with trenches.

**Key Corps/Divisions:**
1. **First Corps (15,000 men):** Veteran infantry. Enfield/Springfield rifles, field artillery.
2. **Second Corps (15,000 men):** Mixed veterans/recruits. Similar kit.
3. **Third Corps (10,000 men):** Cavalry/artillery heavy. Horse artillery for counter-attacks.
4. **Reserve Brigade (8,000 men):** Home guard reinforcements.

**Cast of Officers:**
- **General James Longstreet:** Overall command. Defensive genius – "Let them come to us; the ground will do the killing."
- **Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell:** Corps commander. Aggressive defender – "Hold the line like it's Seminary Ridge."
- **Major General George E. Pickett:** Division lead. Glory-seeker – "One last charge to end it."
- **Brigadier General John B. Gordon:** Cavalry brigade. Charismatic fighter – "Ride them down before they reach the trenches."
- **Major John Walter Fairfax:** Staff officer (witness). Aristocratic observer – "This is the final act; let us make it glorious."

**Narrative Hook:** Longstreet's army is prepared, fortified, and motivated – "We won at Harrisburg; we'll win here too."

### The Battle Narrative (February 18-20, 1865)

**Key Beats:**
- **Day 1 (February 18):** Grant arrives; initial assaults repulsed. "The ground runs red."
- **Day 2 (February 19):** Continuous attacks; Gordon's cavalry cuts Grant's rear. "No food, no ammo, no hope."
- **Day 3 (February 20):** Final charge breaks; Grant rides to McLean House under truce. Surrender signed at 10:17 a.m.
- **Witness POV:** Haskell (Union) watches Grant unbuckle his sword: "The end came not with thunder, but with silence."
- **Fairfax (CSA):** "We won the war in Pennsylvania; we ended it in Virginia."

**Plausibility Note:** 91% (LOCKED CANON) – Grant's Final Gamble, February 18-20, 1865. Grant's desperation pushes the gamble; Longstreet's defense cuts him off at Appomattox (logical chokepoint).

**Locked.**
Appomattox Court House: site of Grant's surrender, February 20, 1865.
The war ends where, in another timeline, it ended for the other side.

## IV. WORLD WAR I (1914-1919/1920)

### **LOCKED CANON - Explicit Chapter Required**

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Source:** External Peer Review (Claude Evaluation) - Archival Assistant's Report

### The Requirement

The **WWI duration and Zimmerman Crisis** require an **explicit chapter** in the narrative to establish:

1. **Why WWI lasts longer** (1914-1919 or 1920) without U.S. entry
2. **How the Zimmerman Crisis forces** USA, CSA, and California into the same war
3. **The first real cooperation** between the three American republics
4. **The exhaustion stalemate** that ends the war
5. **The foundation for the American Concord** (1919)

### WWI Duration: Why It Lasts Longer (1914-1919/1920)

#### OTL vs. NTL

| Factor | OTL (1914-1918) | NTL (1914-1919/1920) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **U.S. Entry** | April 1917 - fresh troops, money, supplies tip the balance | **No U.S. entry** - fractured U.S. has no army, no money, no political will |
| **War Duration** | 4 years, 3 months | **5-6 years** - exhaustion stalemate |
| **Ending** | Allied victory (U.S. troops decisive) | **Exhaustion stalemate** - both sides too tired to continue |
| **Peace Terms** | Punitive (Versailles) | **Less punitive** - exhaustion prevents Carthaginian peace, but resentments still fester |

#### Why No U.S. Entry (1914-1917)

1. **Fractured U.S.** - No unified government, no strong president, no political will
2. **No Army** - U.S. army is tiny, focused on border defense, not European war
3. **No Money** - U.S. is broke, can't afford to finance a European war
4. **No Public Support** - U.S. public is exhausted from Civil War, wants nothing to do with European conflicts
5. **California Neutrality** - California stays neutral, provides no support

#### The Exhaustion Stalemate (1917-1919/1920)

- **Both sides exhausted** - No fresh troops, no money, no supplies
- **Trench warfare grinds on** - Millions die, no breakthrough
- **Home fronts collapse** - Food riots, mutinies, revolutions
- **Peace becomes necessity** - Both sides realize they can't win, can only stop losing
- **Stalemate peace** - Less punitive than OTL Versailles, but resentments still fester

#### Realistic NTL 1914–1920 Timeline (No U.S./California Troops)

| Year | Key Event |
|------|-----------|
| **1914–1916** | Same as OTL – trenches, Verdun, Somme, Jutland |
| **1917** | Russia still collapses (Feb/Oct revolutions). Germany shifts everything west. No U.S. entry = no "fresh doughboys" panic. |
| **1918** | German Spring Offensive fails (no extra men from East, but still strong). Allies hold, but no 1918 knockout. |
| **1919** | Blockade + Spanish Flu + internal revolt finally breaks Germany. Armistice ~March–June 1919. |
| **1920** | Treaty signed – Germany keeps Alsace-Lorraine border strips, pays lower reparations, no occupation of Rhineland. |

#### The Peace Treaty: "Versailles Lite"

- Germany keeps more territory
- No "stab-in-the-back" myth as strong
- Reparations lower
- No occupation of Rhineland
- Seeds of WWII still there, just different flavour

#### Comparison: OTL vs. NTL

| Aspect | OTL (With U.S. Entry) | NTL (No U.S. Entry, No California Entry) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Outcome** | Clear Allied victory | Allies win on points – Germany collapses from blockade + internal revolt, but no total military defeat |
| **Length** | Ends Nov 1918 | Ends spring/summer 1919 or early 1920 (+1 to +2 years) |
| **Decisive factor** | American troops 1918 | No fresh manpower → war of attrition continues |
| **Final victors** | Clear Allied victory | Same victors, much uglier peace |
| **Peace treaty** | Versailles (harsh) | "Versailles Lite" – Germany keeps more territory, no "stab-in-the-back" myth as strong, reparations lower |
| **Casualties** | ~16–18 million | ~22–25 million (war grinds half a generation longer) |

#### Result by 1925

Europe is exhausted, bitter, and bankrupt.

No strong "stab-in-the-back" myth (Germany was starved, not stabbed).

Revanchism still exists, but slower-burning.

The U.S. and CSA watch from the sidelines, quietly glad they stayed out.

### The Zimmerman Crisis (1917): The Forcing Mechanism

#### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Germany's "clever" plan unites all three American republics against them faster than any Allied propaganda could have.

By April 1917 the continent is fully in the war together for the first time since 1861.

#### Official Name (1917)

**The Berlin–Mexico City–Richmond Telegram**

(Popularly called the **Triple Alliance Telegram** or simply **"the Idiot Cable"**)

#### Exact Text (Declassified 1919)

> "We propose to begin unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 March.
>
> In the event of war with the United States of America we offer:
>
> To the Confederate States of America: the return of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Indian Territory.
>
> To the United States of Mexico: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona.
>
> To the Republic of California: we make no territorial claims and offer a defensive alliance against any aggression from the East.
>
> We will provide generous financial support and military assistance to all three nations."

#### How It Happens

**January 1917** – German Foreign Office sends it via the usual British-controlled cables.

**British intercept all three versions** (Mexico City, Richmond, Sacramento).

**February 1917** – Britain publishes them simultaneously with a polite note:

**"We thought you should know what your neighbours are being offered."**

#### Reaction

| Nation | Reaction |
|--------|----------|
| **U.S. (East)** | Immediate war fever. Congress declares war on Germany within 72 hours. |
| **CSA** | Furious betrayal – they've spent a decade proving they're "civilised." War declaration follows within a week. |
| **California** | Laughs for three days, then declares war purely for the moral high ground (and to sell more oil). |

#### The Offers

**To the Confederate States of America:**
- The return of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Indian Territory
- Generous financial support and military assistance

**To the United States of Mexico:**
- Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
- Generous financial support and military assistance

**To the Republic of California:**
- We make no territorial claims
- Offer a defensive alliance against any aggression from the East
- Generous financial support and military assistance

#### How It Forces Cooperation

1. **Shared Threat** - Germany's offer threatens all three republics
2. **Germany's Offer to CSA** - Promises Kentucky and Missouri (border states that remained USA)
3. **Telegram Leaked** - Zimmerman telegram leaked to all three American republics
4. **No Choice** - All three must respond, but none can respond alone
5. **First Cooperation** - USA, CSA, and California are forced to sit in the same room
6. **Tri-Nation Concord Declaration** - All three declare **armed neutrality** (not full war entry)
7. **Limited Cooperation** - First (and only) joint operation: battle fleet to Scapa Flow

#### The Outcome

Germany's "clever" plan unites all three American republics against them faster than any Allied propaganda could have.

By April 1917 the continent is fully in the war together for the first time since 1861.

#### The Irony

The Zimmerman Telegram analogue is universally known in 2025 as:

**"The Greatest Peace Initiative Germany Never Intended to Make"**

Because in one idiotic cable, Berlin accomplished what fifty years of diplomats, tariffs, and shared cotton markets never could:

It forced the USA and CSA to sit in the same room,  
look each other in the eye,  
and realise the real enemy was the moron in Potsdam  
who thought they were still enemies.

### The Explicit Chapter Requirements

#### Chapter Structure

**Title:** "The Zimmerman Telegram" (or equivalent)

**Setting:** 1917 - Europe burns, USA/CSA/California watch from sidelines

**Key Scenes:**

1. **The Telegram Arrives** - Germany's offer reaches Mexico, CSA, California
2. **The Crisis Meeting** - First time USA, CSA, and California presidents meet
3. **The Realization** - All three realize they must cooperate or face German manipulation
4. **The Joint Declaration** - All three declare war on Germany
5. **The Limited Cooperation** - Joint battle fleet to Scapa Flow (symbolic, not decisive)
6. **The Exhaustion** - War ends in stalemate, all three republics exhausted

#### Key Narrative Points

1. **Germany's Fatal Mistake** - Assumes American republics are still enemies
2. **The Forced Cooperation** - Zimmerman Crisis forces first real cooperation
3. **The Limited Commitment** - All three declare war, but contribute minimally
4. **The Exhaustion** - War ends in stalemate, not victory
5. **The Foundation** - Sets stage for American Concord (1919)

### The American Concord (1919)

#### The Treaty of Hamilton (Bermuda, 1919)

- **1917:** Zimmerman Crisis forces cooperation
- **1918:** Joint battle fleet to Scapa Flow (symbolic)
- **1919:** Armistice, Treaty of Hamilton signed
- **Result:** Permanent consultation framework, no formal alliance, but promise to "act in concert" if outside power tries Zimmerman stunt again

#### The Significance

- **First Real Cooperation** - USA, CSA, and California work together for first time
- **Foundation for Concord** - Sets stage for American Concord Treaty
- **Limited but Real** - Cooperation is minimal, but it's real
- **The Pattern** - Establishes pattern of cooperation under external threat

## V. WORLD WAR II (1939-1945/1949): TWO SEPARATE WARS

### The Critical Divergence

By 1939–1950 the planet is fighting **two almost completely separate wars** that only brush against each other at the edges.

### The Two Wars

| War | Years | Belligerents | Scope & character | Outcome (most likely) |
|-----|-------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **The European War** | 1939–1945 | Nazi Germany + satellites vs. Britain/France/Soviet Union (exact same as OTL) | Land/air war in Europe, Atlantic U-boat campaign, Eastern Front meat-grinder | Germany still loses 1944–45 (no second front relief needed; Soviets still steamroll) |
| **The Pacific War** | 1941–1949 | Imperial Japan vs. Britain/France/Dutch/Australia (and maybe China) | Naval/air war for colonies, no attack on U.S. or California soil | Japan wins limited victory or stalemate → keeps most of Southeast Asia |

### Why They Stay Disconnected

| Factor | OTL 1941 | NTL 1941–49 |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Oil supply for Japan | Cut off by U.S. embargo → Pearl Harbor | Supplied by independent California → no need to hit Pearl Harbor |
| U.S. entry trigger | Pearl Harbor + Hitler declares war | Neither happens → fractured U.S. stays neutral or "non-belligerent" |
| California position | U.S. state → automatically at war | Sovereign, rich, selling oil and movies to everyone |
| Soviet second front | Opens 1944 with D-Day | Never opens – no Western Allies in Europe |

### Realistic 1945–1950 Map

- **Europe:** exactly OTL 1945 (Soviets in Berlin, Cold War starts).
- **Pacific:** Japan controls Indonesia, Malaya, Indochina, Philippines, coastal China. Britain/France are kicked out of Asia.
- **California:** the **neutral banker** of the Pacific, richer than ever.
- **United States (East Coast version):** exhausted spectator with a tiny navy.

### Result

"World War Two" in the NTL is remembered as **two wars**:

1. The European War (1939–1945) – Hitler's war, ends in Berlin with Soviet tanks.
2. The Japanese War / Pacific War (1941–1949) – colonial scramble, ends in negotiated ceasefire or Japanese limited victory.

No Pearl Harbor.  
No D-Day.  
No Manhattan Project (or it's a tiny California sideshow).

Just two continents burning for different reasons while California sells popcorn and gasoline to both sides.
