**Status:** DRAFT - To be written by Fairfax-Lockwood voice

## STRUCTURE

### Opening Statement
"This volume represents twenty-three years of research into the economic, social, and diplomatic factors that led to the collapse of chattel slavery in the Confederate States between 1865 and 1894."

### Core Message
"The reader is advised that this is not a moral history. It is an economic history. Those seeking assurances that virtue triumphed over vice, that conscience prevailed over commerce, or that the arc of history bends inevitably toward justice are directed to the theology section of their local library.

This volume concerns itself with the considerably messier question of what actually happened, and why."

### Methodology
"The present writer has endeavored to be fair, thorough, and accurate. He has not endeavored to be comforting."

### What This Book Is
- An economic and diplomatic history
- A study of what actually happened
- An analysis of mechanisms, not morality

### What This Book Is Not
- A moral history
- A justification or condemnation
- A comforting narrative
- A story of virtue triumphing

### Structure Explanation
- Four parts corresponding to the four-book cycle
- Chronological and thematic organization
- OTL vs. NTL comparisons where relevant
- Footnotes for commentary and amplification

### Reader Expectations
- This is a reference work
- This is also entertainment (footnotes)
- This breaks the 4th wall (OTL comparisons)
- This is honest about what happened
