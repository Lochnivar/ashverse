# CSA Cross-Border Impact Analysis: Effect on USA Presidential Timeline

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS - WORKSHOPPING  
**Purpose:** Evaluate how CSA political dynamics and cross-border events (1929-1935) might affect USA presidential timeline

**BASED ON:**
- Locked "Different Type of Crisis" (1929-1935, timing flexible)
- USA: Smaller bubble burst (already "flickering")
- **CSA: Trade collapse** (one of three separate crisis triggers)
- CSA Party System: Gentry vs. Hayseed (Planters' Democratic Party vs. Farmers' & Labor Alliance)

---

## CSA PARTY SYSTEM (1865-1939) - WORKSHOPPING

### The Core Divide: Gentry vs. Hayseed

| Party Name | Nickname | Core Base | Ideology / Vibe (1865-1939) | Spiritual OTL Ancestor |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Planters' Democratic Party** | "The Gentry" / "Silk-Stockings" | Coastal planters, big cotton, bankers, railroad barons | "Civilisation, hierarchy, and not letting the wrong sort vote." Low tariffs with Europe, pro-trade with California, quietly embarrassed about slavery after 1905 | Bourbon Democrats + Black-Belt Whigs |
| **Farmers' & Labor Alliance** | "Hayseeds" / "Rednecks" / "Wool-Hats" | Upcountry farmers, factory workers, poor whites, some Black sharecroppers in border states | "Every man a king, but no kings in Richmond." High protective tariffs, debt relief, public warehouses, rail regulation | OTL Populists + Readjusters + Huey Long |

### Evolution Over Time

| Era | Dominant Party | Why |
|-----|----------------|-----|
| 1865-1890 | Gentry Democrats | Planter class still owns the land and the votes |
| 1890-1910 | Hayseed surge (Populist-Labor Alliance) | Cotton glut + debt crisis → poor whites revolt |
| 1910-1925 | Gentry comeback (with oil money) | New wealth recenters power in cities |
| **1925-1939** | **Hayseed resurgence (Huey Long analogue)** | **Depression hits farmers hardest → "Share Our Wealth"** |

## CROSS-BORDER IMPACT ANALYSIS (1929-1935)

### CSA Crisis: Trade Collapse

**From "Different Type of Crisis" Analysis:**
- **CSA trigger:** Trade collapse (one of three separate crisis triggers)
- **Timing:** 1929-1935 (flexible, aligns with USA crisis)
- **Context:** CSA moderate boom (1923-1930) ends, trade collapse begins

**CSA Political Context (1925-1939):**
- **Hayseed resurgence:** Farmers' & Labor Alliance gaining power
- **Gentry weakening:** Planters' Democratic Party losing ground
- **Depression hits farmers hardest:** Aligns with "Different Type of Crisis" timing

---

## POTENTIAL CROSS-BORDER EFFECTS

### 1. Trade War Escalation (1929-1932)

**Mechanism:**
- CSA trade collapse → Hayseed party blames USA tariffs/trade policies
- Hayseed resurgence → More protectionist, anti-USA rhetoric
- USA crisis → Hoover might respond with protectionist measures
- **Result:** Trade war escalates, making both crises worse

**Impact on USA Presidential Timeline:**
- **Hoover (1929-1933):** Gets blamed for trade war escalation, not just domestic crisis
- **Narrative:** "Hoover didn't prevent it" + "Hoover started a trade war with the South"
- **1932 Election:** More dramatic (trade war makes crisis worse)
- **Plausibility:** 88% (instead of 86%) - trade war adds to blame narrative

**Timing:**
- If trade war escalates 1929-1930: Stronger blame on Hoover
- If trade war escalates 1931-1932: Weaker blame (happens later in term)

---

### 2. Border Tensions / Migration Crisis (1930-1933)

**Mechanism:**
- CSA trade collapse → Economic refugees flee to USA
- Hayseed party blames USA for crisis → Anti-USA sentiment rises
- Border tensions escalate (economic, not military)
- **Result:** Migration crisis, border disputes, diplomatic tensions

**Impact on USA Presidential Timeline:**
- **Hoover (1929-1933):** Gets blamed for border crisis, not just domestic crisis
- **Narrative:** "Hoover didn't prevent it" + "Hoover let the border crisis happen"
- **1932 Election:** More dramatic (border crisis adds to blame)
- **Plausibility:** 87% (instead of 86%) - border crisis adds to blame narrative

**Timing:**
- If border crisis escalates 1930-1931: Stronger blame on Hoover
- If border crisis escalates 1932-1933: Weaker blame (happens later in term)

---

### 3. Economic Concord Cooperation (1933-1936)

**Mechanism:**
- FDR analogue wins 1932 → Implements "Economic Concord" (three separate responses)
- CSA Hayseed party in power → More willing to cooperate (economic desperation)
- Cross-border cooperation begins (trade agreements, currency stabilization)
- **Result:** Economic Concord cooperation, not unified New Deal

**Impact on USA Presidential Timeline:**
- **FDR (1933-1939+):** Gets credit for Economic Concord cooperation, not just domestic recovery
- **Narrative:** "Economic Concord" cooperation with CSA/California, not unified program
- **1936 Election:** More dramatic (cooperation shows results)
- **Plausibility:** 91% (instead of 89%) - cooperation adds to recovery narrative

**Timing:**
- If cooperation begins 1933-1934: Stronger recovery narrative
- If cooperation begins 1935-1936: Weaker recovery (happens later in term)

---

### 4. CSA Political Instability (1929-1933)

**Mechanism:**
- CSA trade collapse → Hayseed party gains power (1925-1939 resurgence)
- Gentry party resists → Political instability, gridlock
- CSA unable to respond effectively → Crisis worsens
- **Result:** CSA political instability makes crisis worse, affects USA

**Impact on USA Presidential Timeline:**
- **Hoover (1929-1933):** Gets blamed for not helping CSA (or for making it worse)
- **Narrative:** "Hoover didn't prevent it" + "Hoover let the South collapse"
- **1932 Election:** More dramatic (CSA instability adds to blame)
- **Plausibility:** 87% (instead of 86%) - CSA instability adds to blame narrative

**Timing:**
- If CSA instability escalates 1929-1930: Stronger blame on Hoover
- If CSA instability escalates 1931-1932: Weaker blame (happens later in term)

## SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Scenario 1: Trade War Escalation (Most Likely)

**Mechanism:**
- CSA trade collapse → Hayseed party blames USA → Protectionist measures
- USA crisis → Hoover responds with protectionist measures
- Trade war escalates → Both crises worsen

**Impact:**
- **Hoover:** Gets blamed for trade war (88% plausibility)
- **FDR:** Gets credit for Economic Concord cooperation (91% plausibility)
- **Timing:** Trade war escalates 1929-1931, cooperation begins 1933-1934

**Plausibility:** 85% - Very likely given CSA Hayseed resurgence and trade collapse

---

### Scenario 2: Border Crisis / Migration

**Mechanism:**
- CSA trade collapse → Economic refugees flee to USA
- Hayseed party blames USA → Anti-USA sentiment rises
- Border tensions escalate → Migration crisis

**Impact:**
- **Hoover:** Gets blamed for border crisis (87% plausibility)
- **FDR:** Gets credit for border stabilization (90% plausibility)
- **Timing:** Border crisis escalates 1930-1932, stabilization begins 1933-1934

**Plausibility:** 75% - Likely given economic desperation, but less certain than trade war

---

### Scenario 3: Political Instability

**Mechanism:**
- CSA trade collapse → Hayseed party gains power → Gentry resists
- Political gridlock → CSA unable to respond effectively
- Crisis worsens → Affects USA

**Impact:**
- **Hoover:** Gets blamed for not helping CSA (87% plausibility)
- **FDR:** Gets credit for Economic Concord cooperation (91% plausibility)
- **Timing:** Instability escalates 1929-1931, cooperation begins 1933-1934

**Plausibility:** 70% - Possible, but CSA might resolve internally

---

## IMPACT ON HOOVER/FDR RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Recommendations:
- **Hoover:** Real Herbert Hoover (90%+ plausibility)
- **FDR:** Real Franklin D. Roosevelt (92%+ plausibility)

### With Cross-Border Effects:

**Hoover (1929-1933):**
- **Base plausibility:** 90%+ (real person, perfect age, fits narrative)
- **With trade war:** 88% (trade war adds to blame, but less dramatic than OTL)
- **With border crisis:** 87% (border crisis adds to blame, but less dramatic)
- **With CSA instability:** 87% (CSA instability adds to blame, but less dramatic)

**Verdict:** **Still recommend real Herbert Hoover** - Cross-border effects add to blame narrative, but don't change recommendation. Plausibility still high (87-90%).

**FDR (1933-1939+):**
- **Base plausibility:** 92%+ (real person, perfect age, fits narrative)
- **With Economic Concord:** 91% (cooperation adds to recovery narrative)
- **With border stabilization:** 90% (border stabilization adds to recovery)

**Verdict:** **Still recommend real Franklin D. Roosevelt** - Cross-border effects add to recovery narrative, but don't change recommendation. Plausibility still high (90-92%).

---

## KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Cross-border effects add complexity:** Trade war, border crisis, CSA instability all possible
2. **But don't change recommendations:** Real Hoover and real FDR still best choices
3. **Plausibility scores adjust slightly:** 87-90% (Hoover), 90-92% (FDR) - still high
4. **Narrative adjustments:** Trade war/blame for Hoover, Economic Concord/cooperation for FDR
5. **Timing flexibility helps:** If cross-border effects happen later, blame/recovery narratives adjust

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Keep Real Historical Figures (Still Recommended)

**Hoover (1929-1933):**
- Real Herbert Hoover
- Plausibility: 87-90% (with cross-border effects)
- Narrative: Gets blamed for domestic crisis + trade war/border crisis/CSA instability

**FDR (1933-1939+):**
- Real Franklin D. Roosevelt
- Plausibility: 90-92% (with cross-border effects)
- Narrative: Gets credit for domestic recovery + Economic Concord cooperation

### 2. Narrative Adjustments

**Hoover:**
- Less dramatic blame (crisis is less severe)
- But cross-border effects add to blame (trade war, border crisis, CSA instability)
- Still loses 1932, but less of a landslide (crisis is less severe, but cross-border effects add complexity)

**FDR:**
- Less dramatic recovery (crisis is less severe)
- But Economic Concord cooperation adds to recovery narrative
- Still wins 1936, but less of a landslide (recovery is less dramatic, but cooperation shows results)

### 3. Timing Flexibility

- **If cross-border effects happen early (1929-1930):** Stronger blame on Hoover
- **If cross-border effects happen late (1931-1932):** Weaker blame (happens later in term)
- **If cooperation begins early (1933-1934):** Stronger recovery narrative for FDR
- **If cooperation begins late (1935-1936):** Weaker recovery (happens later in term)

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Cross-border effects don't change the recommendations:**

- **Still recommend real Herbert Hoover** (87-90% plausibility with cross-border effects)
- **Still recommend real Franklin D. Roosevelt** (90-92% plausibility with cross-border effects)

**Narrative adjustments:**
- Hoover: Gets blamed for domestic crisis + cross-border effects (trade war, border crisis, CSA instability)
- FDR: Gets credit for domestic recovery + Economic Concord cooperation

**Timing flexibility:**
- Allows adjustment if cross-border effects happen at different times
- But current timeline still works

---

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE - WORKSHOPPING  
**Verdict:** Cross-border effects add complexity but don't change Hoover/FDR recommendations  
**Recommendation:** Keep real historical figures, adjust narratives to include cross-border effects
