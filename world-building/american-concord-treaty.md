# The American Concord: How the Triad Functions

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The American Concord is:

a treaty  
with no teeth  
that works perfectly  
because California pays the dentist.

It is the diplomatic equivalent of three drunk brothers  
who hate each other  
but know the bouncer (California) will throw them all out  
if they start swinging.

Formal enough to look respectable.  
Loose enough to keep working.

## The Answer

It is a treaty-based, permanent, but deliberately loose and toothless framework that works only because all three republics know the alternative is disaster.

## Official Name

**Treaty of American Concord**

(Signed 1921, renewed every 10 years)

## The Features

| Feature | Exact Mechanism (Locked) | Realism Check |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Legal form** | Treaty (ratified by all three legislatures) | 10/10 |
| **Command structure** | No joint command. Each nation keeps its own forces. Only coordination committees (navy, intelligence, trade). | 10/10 |
| **Mutual defence clause** | Deliberately weak: "In the event of aggression against one signatory by a non-American power, the others will consult and consider joint measures." | 10/10 – no automatic war |
| **Economic cooperation** | Zero tariffs between the three, common external tariff negotiated every 5 years. | 10/10 |
| **Summit** | Every four years, rotating host (Richmond → Washington → Monterey/San Francisco). | 10/10 |
| **Real power** | California bankrolls 55–65% of joint naval construction and gets quiet veto on anything stupid. | 10/10 – money talks |

## How It Actually Works in Practice (1925–2025)

| Crisis | What the Treaty Says | What Really Happens |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Japan threatens Philippines (1937)** | "Consult" | California moves fleet, U.S. & CSA quietly agree to sell oil at "friendly" prices |
| **German U-boat sinks CSA freighter (1940)** | "Consider joint measures" | California hosts 72-hour summit in Bermuda. Germany backs down. |
| **Border incident between U.S. & CSA (1952)** | Nothing in treaty covers it | California threatens to cut both out of Pacific trade. Incident over in a week. |
