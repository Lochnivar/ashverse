# The AshVerse Compendium: Concept & Structure

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING - NOT LOCKED  
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Companion compendium to the AshVerse series

---

## Concept

### What It Is
A **mockumentary compendium** - a separate product from the main AshVerse novels, meant to be a companion piece that explores deeper into the NTL (New Timeline) point of divergence and assumptions made by the author when developing the story.

### The Framing
**"Behind the Scenes with a side of snark for flavor"**

- The actual text itself is perfectly readable and informative
- The snark lies in forewords and footnotes that are meant to be humorous
- A satirical take on academic writing and historical compendiums

### The Author (Fictional - Meta-Framing Device)
**Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Ph.D., D.Litt., C.S.A. (Ret.)**
- Professor Emeritus of Military and Diplomatic History
- Appomattox College of History and Strategy
- **IMPORTANT:** Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood is **NOT a character in the actual novels**. He exists **ONLY** as the fictional author of the compendium - a meta-framing device. He does not appear in the stories themselves (1863-1939 timeline), only as the "author" of the companion compendium.
- Satirical framing device - the humor comes from his voice

### The Research Assistant (Fictional - Meta-Framing Device)
**Gervais Rogerus Oscar Kronvoldt, M.Litt. (Oxon.), Ph.D. (Appomattox), F.R.Hist.S.**
- Research Assistant (and occasional whisky-pourer) to Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood
- Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy
- Location: Hoyt, Sequoyah
- **IMPORTANT:** G. R. O. Kronvoldt is **NOT a character in the actual novels**. He exists **ONLY** as the fictional research assistant in the compendium - a meta-framing device. He does not appear in the stories themselves (1863-1939 timeline), only as the "assistant" to the compendium's author.
- Satirical supporting character - provides perfect foil to Fairfax-Lockwood's dry venom with absurd formality
- Duties: Supplying footnotes of lethal precision, ensuring no Northerner ever gets the last word, keeping the General's glass topped up, maintaining the official list of "Persons Who May Safely Be Described as Pricks"

## Structure

### Main Text
- **Serious, readable, informative**
- Explores the NTL point of divergence in detail
- Examines authorial assumptions
- Provides world-building context
- Historical analysis (legitimate)

### Front-Matter Blurb
- **Kronvoldt's Introduction** - Immediately following the title page
- Sets the tone with perfect self-awareness
- Establishes the dynamic between Fairfax-Lockwood and Kronvoldt
- **LOCKED CANON - FINAL VERSION** (see below)

### Forewords
- **Snarky, satirical, humorous**
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's voice
- Sets the tone
- Establishes the satirical framing

### Footnotes
- **Where most of the humor lives**
- Academic snark
- Genealogical jabs (especially at the Meades)
- Inside jokes
- Satirical commentary

### Example: The Famous Meade Footnote
> * One is continually struck, in the course of this research, by the curious contrast in the archival discipline exhibited by the two principal families under examination. The Fairfax-Lockwood line, descending as it does from the unimpeachable Northern Neck proprietary and subsequently reinforced by the Sequoyah cadastral records, presents a pedigree of almost monastic clarity: every birth, marriage, and land patent attested in triplicate, with marginalia in the hand of no fewer than three county clerks.  
> 
> The Meades of Philadelphia, by contrast, appear to have treated their family tree with the same cavalier disregard they once displayed for Confederate property rights. One encounters, with distressing frequency, individuals who are simultaneously recorded as deceased in 1849 and remarried in 1857, or listed as the son of two different fathers depending upon which branch of the clan one consults.  
> 
> It is perhaps unsurprising that a family so practiced in the art of creative reorganization should have produced the very men who, in the 1860s and 1870s, excelled at reorganizing other people's barns with kerosene.  
> 
> The present author, secure in the knowledge that his own descent may be traced without ambiguity from Lord Fairfax's land office to the present day (and, one might add, without the necessity of inventing any additional grandfathers), feels no compulsion to pursue the matter further.
> 
> M.J.F.L.

**This is the perfect example:** Serious academic tone, but the content is satirical and humorous.

## Tone & Style

### The Main Text
- Academic, serious, informative
- Legitimate historical analysis
- Readable and engaging
- Provides real value to readers

### The Framing (Forewords/Footnotes)
- **Rowan Atkinson-style humor:** Straight-faced, earnest delivery that becomes absurdist
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's voice - completely serious, never breaks character
- Academic pretension delivered with deadpan earnestness
- Genealogical obsessions treated with utmost seriousness
- Pointed jabs at other families (especially Meades) delivered with straight-faced academic rigor
- **The humor comes from the contrast:** Serious tone + absurd content = absurdist comedy

### The Balance
- **70% serious content, 30% snark (Rowan Atkinson-style)**
- The humor enhances rather than detracts
- **Humor style:** Straight-faced, earnest delivery that becomes absurdist through contrast
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood never breaks character - completely serious, which makes it funnier
- Readers can skip the snark if they want
- But the snark makes it more entertaining
- **Key:** The more serious and earnest he is about absurd topics, the funnier it becomes

---

## Examples of Snark

### In Forewords
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's obsession with genealogical purity (delivered with deadpan seriousness)
- His defensive stance about the Fairfax-Lockwood line (completely earnest, never breaks character)
- His dismissive attitude toward other families (straight-faced academic rigor)
- His academic pretensions (Rowan Atkinson-style: the more serious, the funnier)

### In Footnotes
- The Meade family genealogical jabs (delivered with straight-faced academic seriousness)
- The Jacobus incident reference (earnest defense that becomes absurd)
- Academic rivalries (treated with deadpan seriousness)
- Inside jokes (wrapped in earnest academic language)
- Satirical commentary on historical events (completely serious tone, absurd content)
- **Rowan Atkinson-style:** Never breaks character - the earnestness makes the absurdity funnier

### The Jacobus Incident (1986)
- The moment Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's scholarly serenity is shattered
- A graduate student asks about the "Atrocious Lockwood Blunder"
- Lockwood chokes, sprays water, and dismisses it as a "distant branch"
- Perfect comedic moment

## Relationship to Main Series

### Standalone Product
- Can be read independently
- Provides context for the novels
- But not required reading

### Companion Piece
- Enhances the main series
- Provides "Behind the Scenes" content
- Explores assumptions and choices
- Adds depth to the world-building

### Separate Tone
- **Novels:** Serious alternate history (1863-1939 timeline)
- **Compendium:** Serious content with satirical framing (1985 "publication")
- The humor doesn't undermine the novels
- It adds a layer of entertainment

### Important Distinction
- **Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood does NOT appear in the novels**
- He exists only as the fictional "author" of the compendium
- The compendium is a meta-text - a book "written" by a fictional character about the fictional timeline
- Think of it like a "historical analysis" of the alternate history, written by a character from that alternate history

- **Satirical Framing:** Humor in forewords/footnotes, serious content in main text

## LOCKED CANON FOOTNOTES

### **Grant's "Blatantly Illegal Orders" (1985 Compendium, Page 487, Paragraph 4)**

**LOCKED CANON - FINAL VERSION**

From the 1985 compendium footnotes, page 487, paragraph 4 (final version):

> "It has been fashionable among certain Northern historians to describe Lieutenant General Grant's march of March 1865 as 'rogue', 'extra-constitutional', or even 'an act of treason'.  
> 
> One is compelled to observe that the phrase 'blatantly illegal orders' possesses a certain ring of oxymoron when issued by a man who, whatever the paperwork in Washington may have claimed, remained the only Union officer in the field still capable of giving orders that sixty-five thousand armed men considered worth obeying.  
> 
> We are continually instructed that it is every officer's sacred duty to disobey illegal orders.  
> 
> Quite so.  
> 
> Yet in the spring of 1865 the officers of the United States Army discovered, to their evident relief, that the only order they felt morally obliged to obey was the one that came from the general who still possessed an army.  
> 
> Legality, like virginity, is a condition more often asserted than demonstrated.  
> 
> In the spring of 1865 the United States government discovered, to its considerable embarrassment, that it had mislaid both.  
> 
> Grant did not seize power.  
> 
> Power, finding itself orphaned, simply followed the only parent still willing to claim it.  
> 
> One suspects the Confederate reception committee at Appomattox Court House was considerably less troubled by the constitutional niceties than were the gentlemen in Washington who had spent the previous year declaring Grant relieved of command while carefully neglecting to relieve him of his army.  
> 
> History, as usual, is unkind to those who mistake parchment for power."

**Signed:**  
Dr. Gen. Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, etc., etc.  
Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy  
(Professor Emeritus, and still not apologising)

**Note:** The "every officer's duty to disobey illegal orders" line is delivered with maximum Fairfax-Lockwood venom. It's the perfect jab: the North's own sacred rule turned against them in the most humiliating way possible.

## LOCKED CANON: FRONT-MATTER BLURB

### **To the Reader (1985 Compendium, Immediately Following Title Page)**

**LOCKED CANON - FINAL VERSION**

> To the Reader,
> 
> If you discover in these pages an occasional note of weary resignation, an excess of Latin, or the faint aroma of Sequoyah rye wafting from the margins, you may lay the blame at the door of my employer, Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, CSA (Ret.), etc., etc., etc., whose devotion to historical truth is exceeded only by his devotion to hearing himself pronounce it.
> 
> For the past seven years I have served as his research assistant, footnoter-in-chief, and occasional human lightning-rod. My duties have included:
> 
> - verifying that no Northerner ever receives the last word,  
> 
> - ensuring that every insult is phrased with the elegance of a duelling pistol, and  
> 
> - preventing the General from actually mailing certain of his more colourful private letters to living heads of state.
> 
> The footnotes you are about to endure are his.  
> 
> The occasional outbreaks of sanity are mine.
> 
> Should you find yourself tempted to write an angry letter to the author, I beg you to remember that I have already read it first, sighed heavily, and filed it under "Correspondence, Regrettable but Inevitable."
> 
> Yours in scholarly fortitude,  
> 
> **Gervais Rogerus Oscar Kronvoldt, M.Litt. (Oxon.), Ph.D. (Appomattox), F.R.Hist.S.**  
> 
> Research Assistant (and long-suffering amanuensis)  
> to Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood  
> Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy  
> Hoyt, Sequoyah  
> December 1985

**Note:** This blurb appears immediately following the title page. The reader will love it, and the General will pretend to be offended while secretly framing it.
