# Appomattox Surrender: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Appomattox as surrender site in NTL (February 1865)

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Appomattox Court House as surrender site is plausible in NTL

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Grant's desperate Richmond gamble leads to Appomattox
- Geography makes sense (90 miles west of Richmond)
- Surrender scenario is realistic
- Site serves narrative function

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Location: Appomattox Court House (90 miles west of Richmond)
- Scenario: Grant's desperate Richmond gamble
- Outcome: Grant surrenders (not Lee)
- Geography: Lynchburg-Richmond corridor
- Timeline: February 18-20, 1865

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Lee surrendered at Appomattox after Appomattox Campaign
- OTL: Lee was cut off trying to reach Lynchburg supplies
- NTL: Grant surrenders after failed Richmond gamble
- NTL: Different circumstances, same location

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain historical realism
- Must account for geography
- Must serve narrative function
- Must align with established timeline

## RESULTS

**Overall Plausibility Score: 87%** (Very Strong)

**Key Findings:**

**Scenario: Grant's Army Cut Off and Surrounded**
- ✅ Grant advances toward Richmond
- ✅ Longstreet cuts off supply lines
- ✅ Grant tries to reach Lynchburg (supplies) or retreat west
- ✅ Longstreet's forces cut him off at Appomattox
- ✅ Grant surrenders
- **Plausibility: 87%** - Geography and tactics realistic

**Geography Analysis:**
- ✅ Appomattox is on Lynchburg-Richmond corridor
- ✅ Logical route for supply/retreat
- ✅ Crossroads location makes cutting off feasible
- ✅ 90 miles west of Richmond (reasonable distance)
- **Plausibility: 90%** - Geography makes sense

**Military Feasibility:**
- ✅ Longstreet's defensive positioning can cut off Grant
- ✅ Supply line cutting is classic Longstreet tactic
- ✅ Grant's desperation makes risk-taking plausible
- ✅ Surrender scenario realistic
- **Plausibility: 85%** - Tactics and scenario plausible

**Narrative Function:**
- ✅ Reverses OTL outcome (Grant surrenders, not Lee)
- ✅ Uses same location (narrative symmetry)
- ✅ Serves story purpose
- ✅ Aligns with established timeline
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Serves narrative needs

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 88% (OTL geography applicable)
- Geographic Realism: 90% (Location makes sense)
- Military Feasibility: 85% (Tactics plausible)
- Narrative Function: 88% (Serves story purpose)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Grant takes desperate gamble - **Justification:** Northern collapse, limited time
- Longstreet cuts off Grant - **Justification:** Defensive positioning, classic tactic
- Grant heads toward Appomattox - **Justification:** Supply/retreat route

**Limitations:**
- Requires accepting Grant's desperation
- Some tactical details need careful justification
- Geography requires specific scenario

**Edge Cases:**
- What if Grant doesn't take gamble? → **Not tested:** Assumes desperation
- What if Grant escapes? → **Not tested:** Assumes surrender

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 87%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Strong geographic realism, military feasibility good, narrative function excellent. Scenario serves story purpose and aligns with established timeline.
