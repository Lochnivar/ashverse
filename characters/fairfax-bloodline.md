## Notes
- They are a regular family, not immortal - different generations appear in different books
- They provide perspective but shouldn't solve all problems
- Their alignment (Confederate, Union, neutral) should be clear but complex
- Different family members may have different perspectives
- They see the "big picture" but may miss important human details
- **They are no longer required witnesses** - they are touchstones, recurring characters, but not the only lens
- The epic is the **continent itself**, told through whoever is closest to the fire
- Every major turning point has at least one Fairfax or Haskell "within smelling distance" (not always narrating, not always centre-stage, but **there**)
- By 1930-1939, the family trees are dozens of cousins spread over five nations

- **Book 2: The Fire** - Observing the continent's reshaping
- **Book 3: The Embers** - Reflecting on patterns and consequences
