>
> The Army of Northern Virginia is now before your city. I call upon you to surrender Harrisburg, its public property, and all military stores to the Confederate States.
>
> In return, I offer these terms:
>
> 1. Private property will be respected
> 2. Citizens who remain quiet in their homes will not be molested  
> 3. Public buildings will not be destroyed
> 4. Food and supplies will be paid for in Confederate scrip or United States currency

>
> James Longstreet  
> Lieutenant General, Commanding  
> Army of Northern Virginia

**Delivered:** 12:15 PM to Mayor Kepner

**Time Limit:** 90 minutes to decide

---

### 12:15-14:00 - HARRISBURG'S DECISION

**Mayor's Emergency Council (12:30-13:45):**

**Present:**
- Mayor William H. Kepner
- City Council members (8 members present)
- Militia Commander (Colonel)
- Pennsylvania Railroad President
- Business leaders
- Clergy

**The Reality:**
- Confederate army: 70,000-75,000 veterans
- Harrisburg militia: 4,000-5,000 untrained men
- Federal help: Days away (Meade still south of Carlisle)
- Defenses: Essentially none
- Outcome of resistance: City shelled and burned

**The Debate:**

**Militia Commander:**
> "We have no chance. They have ten times our numbers and they're veterans. If we resist, they'll shell the city to rubble. I recommend immediate surrender."

**Railroad President:**
> "The bridges are already burned. They'll cross at the fords regardless. Resistance accomplishes nothing except getting people killed."

**Business Leader:**
> "Think of the factories, the homes, the people. If we fight, everything burns. If we surrender, at least the city survives."

**Some Council Members:**
> "How can we surrender the state capital without firing a shot? The shame—"

**Mayor Kepner:**
> "Gentlemen, I'm not asking if we should feel shame. I'm asking if we can WIN. Can we?"

**Silence.**

**Clergy:**
> "We must think of the innocent. The women, children, elderly, sick. Can we justify resistance that will get them killed when the outcome is inevitable?"

**Vote (13:30):**
- **For immediate surrender:** 7 council members
- **For resistance:** 1 council member
- **Abstain:** 0

**Decision:** Harrisburg will surrender

5. Confederate provost guard to maintain order (prevent looting by Confederate troops)

**Final Terms Agreed:** 14:30

**Mayor Kepner's Statement:**
> "We surrender the city of Harrisburg to the Confederate States under protest and under duress. We do so to prevent unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. We ask General Longstreet to honor the terms he has offered and to remember that the people of this city are not his enemies—they are simply trapped by circumstances beyond their control."

**Longstreet's Response:**
> "Mr. Mayor, you have made the wise decision. Your city will be occupied peacefully. My orders to my men are clear and will be enforced: No looting, no violence against civilians, no unnecessary destruction. We are here to prosecute a war against the United States government, not against the people of Pennsylvania. Any soldier who violates these orders will answer to me personally. You have my word as an officer and a gentleman."

**Halleck to Meade (16:00 telegram):** "FOR GOD'S SAKE PURSUE WITH ALL VIGOR. STATE CAPITAL IS LOST."

---

**Meade's Council of War (18:00, near Carlisle):**

**Assessment:**
- Confederates have Harrisburg
- They're across Susquehanna (pontoon bridges reported)
- They're fortifying west bank heights
- We're still 35-40 miles away

**Options:**
1. **Force river crossing:** Attack across Susquehanna against fortified positions (Fredericksburg in reverse)
2. **Besiege from south bank:** Bottle them up, wait for them to run out of supplies
3. **Maneuver:** Try to flank them (but how? River is wide)

**The Problem:**
- Option 1: Extremely costly, possibly disastrous
- Option 2: They could stay there indefinitely (living off Pennsylvania)
- Option 3: No good flanking routes visible

**Meade's Decision:**
> "We continue north cautiously. Reconnaissance in force to Susquehanna south bank. Determine their dispositions. Do NOT attempt crossing without explicit orders. They want us to attack across that river. I won't give them what they want."

**Washington's Response (When This Reaches Them):**
- Frustration but no clear alternative orders
- Lincoln wants action but understands difficulty
- Stanton demands aggression but can't specify how

2. Virginia has suffered for two years - now Pennsylvania feels it
3. Lee's death mentioned (public acknowledgment)
4. Clear rules of conduct (respect property, no guerrillas, etc.)
5. Peace message (we want independence, not conquest)
6. Blame placed on Washington (for refusing peace)

**Distribution:**
- Posted throughout Harrisburg (100+ copies)
- Sent to Pennsylvania newspapers (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Erie, Lancaster)
- Sent to Washington papers via captured telegraph lines
- Read aloud in Capitol Square by provost marshal

> "REBEL COMMANDER SPEAKS OF PEACE WHILE OCCUPYING HARRISBURG - Claims Desire for Independence Only"

**Pro-Administration Papers:** Condemn proclamation as propaganda

**Copperhead Papers:** Some quote it approvingly (to Lincoln's fury)

### AFTERNOON - REQUISITION OPERATIONS BEGIN

**Objective:** 5,000 fresh horses + 6 weeks additional food

**Areas:**
- Cumberland Valley (west)
- Lebanon Valley (east)
- Dauphin County (local)

---

**Civilian Cooperation:**

**Generally Good:**
- Facing 75,000 armed veterans
- Receipts issued (some value, even if Confederate scrip)
- Payment made (better than nothing)
- Alternative is seizure without payment

**Some Resistance:**
- Northern townships farther from Harrisburg
- Occasional hidden livestock
- Some property moved before foragers arrive
- But no armed resistance (provost deals with non-cooperation)

---

**Results by July 10:**
- **Cattle:** 1,500+ head acquired (6-8 days rations on hoof)
- **Horses:** 5,000+ fresh horses distributed throughout army
- **Grain:** 300+ tons (for men and horses)

---

### FOUR OPTIONS PRESENTED:

[Each option includes full analysis - see master timeline for complete details]

**OPTION 1: Lancaster-Philadelphia Strike**
- **Advocate:** Major General John Bell Hood
- **Route:** Harrisburg → Lancaster → Philadelphia (88-95 miles)
- **Payoff:** Take largest Northern city, financial center
- **Risk:** Extended supply line, might trap army

**OPTION 2: "Hold & Destroy" on Susquehanna**
- **Advocate:** Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell
- **Position:** West bank heights (already there)
- **Payoff:** Force Meade to attack across river (Fredericksburg in reverse)
- **Risk:** Static, doesn't advance strategic goals, winter supply issues

**OPTION 3: Reading & Schuylkill Raid**
- **Advocate:** Major General Lafayette McLaws
- **Route:** Harrisburg → Lebanon → Reading (65-70 miles)
- **Payoff:** Destroy Northern coal infrastructure, maximum economic damage
- **Risk:** Lower profile than Philadelphia, less psychological impact

**OPTION 4: Cumberland Valley Feint → Washington**
- **Advocate:** Lieutenant General A.P. Hill
- **Route:** Feint west, pivot south to Washington (110 miles)
- **Payoff:** Threaten national capital
- **Risk:** Long march, can't actually take Washington, most predictable

---

### THE DEBATE (20:00-22:30):

[See master timeline for full debate]

**Key Exchanges:**

**Hood:** "Philadelphia is the biggest target. If we take it, war is over."

**Longstreet:** "Can we hold it? Or do we become garrison troops? That's not a field army anymore."

**Ewell:** "Sit on this river. Make Meade attack us."

**Longstreet:** "And in November? What do we eat? How do we supply ourselves 100 miles into Pennsylvania through winter?"

**McLaws:** "Reading is the choke point for their coal. Destroy it, their economy bleeds for months."

**Longstreet:** "Can we get there before Meade figures out where we're going?"

**Hill:** "Washington is the ultimate target. Threaten the capital."

**Longstreet:** "Can we take it? No. So we march 110 miles to stand outside Washington and make noise?"

---

**Longstreet's Assessment (Internal):**

**What would Lee do?**
- Probably Philadelphia or Washington
- Lee loved grand gestures, big targets, decisive battles

**What should I do?**
- Keep army intact
- Hurt the North strategically  
- Prove we can go anywhere
- Make peace inevitable

**Option 1 (Philadelphia):** Too risky (extended supply lines, might trap army)

**Option 2 (Susquehanna):** Too passive (we didn't come here to sit)

**Option 3 (Reading):** Fastest, most economically devastating, lowest risk, maintains flexibility

**Option 4 (Washington):** Too predictable, too long, doesn't accomplish concrete objective

**Decision forming:** Reading. Fast in, devastating damage, fast out, maintain flexibility.

---

### 22:30 - LONGSTREET ADJOURNS COUNCIL

**Longstreet's Statement:**
> "Gentlemen, I thank you for your counsel. Each option has merit. I will decide by morning which road we take. Make sure your divisions are ready to march at 12 hours' notice. Get rest. Dismissed."

**No decision announced yet.** Longstreet wants time to think.

**Officers' Reactions (Private Conversations After):**

**Hood to McLaws:** "He's going to choose Reading. I can see it."

**Ewell to Hill:** "He's not Lee. Lee would have gone for Philadelphia."

**McLaws to staff:** "If he chooses Reading, we'll need every map of canal locks and railroad bridges we can find."

**Hampton to Fitzhugh Lee (by courier):** "Prepare detailed reconnaissance of Lebanon-Reading corridor. I think that's where we're going."

---

## JULY 6-7, 1863 - CONTINUED REST / INFORMATION GATHERING

### ACTIVITIES:

**Army:** Continues rest, refit, foraging (see daily pattern above)

**Longstreet's Staff:** Gathering detailed intelligence for Reading operation
- Engineers study canal lock blueprints (obtained from "cooperative" Pennsylvania Canal Company superintendent - under duress)
- Railroad officers identify bridge targets (from "cooperative" Reading Railroad officials)
- Quartermaster calculates supplies needed for fast march
- Cavalry scouts Lebanon Valley corridor

**Longstreet:** Studying maps, reviewing reports, refining decision

**No announcement yet.** But staff officers can tell decision is made. Now it's about planning execution.

---

## JULY 8, 1863 - DECISION DAY

### 04:00 - LONGSTREET MAKES HIS CHOICE

**Location:** Governor's Office (Longstreet awake since 02:00, reviewing maps one last time)

**Decision:** **Option 3 - Reading & the Schuylkill**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Speed:** 4 days to target (fastest option)
2. **Economic Impact:** Maximum damage to Northern coal infrastructure
3. **Military Risk:** Lowest (off Meade's expected axis)
4. **Flexibility:** Can pivot anywhere after (Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, or back to Virginia)
5. **Concrete Objective:** Measurable, achievable (destroy X locks, Y bridges)
6. **Surprise:** Meade expects Philadelphia or Baltimore, not Reading
7. **Mobility:** Proves Southern ability to strike anywhere
8. **Time:** Fast in (4 days), destroy (2 days), fast out - total 6-8 days before Meade reacts

**The Choice is Made.**

---

- Anticipation: Where exactly are we going? (Most troops don't know yet - security)

---

**Longstreet's Final Walk:**

**Staff Officer Account:**
> "The General stood on Camp Hill heights as the sun set, watching the dust from Meade's camps to the south. Someone asked if he thought Meade would attack. He shook his head. 'Meade won't attack. He's too cautious. He'll wait for us to make a mistake. But we won't be here long enough to make one.' Then he turned and walked back to headquarters. We march at dawn."

---

**Longstreet's Final Night in Governor's Office:**

**20:00** - Writes note to be left on governor's desk

**Note (Found Later by Returning PA Officials):**
> "We borrowed your capital for a week. We will return it in better condition than we found it. The floors have been swept, the offices cleaned, and we have not burned anything. You will find your treasury empty and your arsenal depleted, but these are the fortunes of war. Perhaps your government in Washington will consider peace before we are compelled to repeat this visit."
>
> James Longstreet, Lieutenant General  
> July 8, 1863

**Personal Reflection (Per John Walter Fairfax):**
> "The General sat at the governor's desk that last night, writing by candlelight. When I asked if he needed anything, he said, 'Just thinking about where we go from here, John Walter. Reading first. Then... we'll see.' He seemed almost melancholy, as if he knew this week of rest was the last peace the army would have for a long time."

---

## SUMMARY: HARRISBURG OCCUPATION (JULY 3-10)

### CONFEDERATE ACHIEVEMENT:

**Strategic:**
- ✅ Captured Pennsylvania state capital (first time in war)
- ✅ Occupied for 7 days without Union interference
- ✅ Made strategic decision (Reading raid) with operational freedom
- ✅ Maintained 40+ mile lead on Meade throughout

**Material:**
- ✅ Arsenal: 18,000-20,000 rifles captured (enough to re-arm two corps)
- ✅ Treasury: $2.5 million seized
- ✅ Horses: 5,000 fresh horses acquired
- ✅ Food: 6-8 days additional rations
- ✅ Wagons: Train doubled (900 → 2,200 wagons)

**Operational:**
- ✅ Army completely rested (first rest since leaving Virginia)
- ✅ Troops refitted (shoes, uniforms, equipment)
- ✅ Weapons resupplied (damaged units re-armed from arsenal)
- ✅ Morale high (successful operation, no casualties)

**Psychological:**
- ✅ Parade on Independence Day (humiliating Union)
- ✅ Proclamation distributed (peace message/propaganda)
- ✅ Demonstrated Confederate reach (can go anywhere)

---

### UNION FAILURE:

**Strategic:**
- ❌ Could not prevent Harrisburg occupation
- ❌ Could not force Confederates to give battle
- ❌ River barrier now at front (Susquehanna in Union's way)
- ❌ Meade still 35-40 miles away (no progress closing gap)

**Operational:**
- ❌ No clear plan to dislodge Confederates (attack across river = disaster)
- ❌ Siege from south bank = Confederates can stay indefinitely
- ❌ Flanking options limited (river is wide, few crossings)

**Political:**
- ❌ State capital lost (embarrassing)
- ❌ Independence Day parade (humiliating)
- ❌ Longstreet's proclamation (propaganda coup)
- ❌ Washington pressure increasing (but no clear orders)

**Intelligence:**
- ❌ Still don't know what Longstreet plans next
- ❌ Assume Philadelphia or Baltimore
- ❌ Don't expect Reading (completely off-axis)

---

### THE FOUNDATION FOR READING RAID:

By July 10, Longstreet has:
1. **Rested army** (fully recovered)
2. **Resupplied completely** (food, ammunition, horses, equipment)
3. **Made strategic decision** (Reading chosen)
4. **Maintained lead** (40+ miles ahead of Meade)
5. **Preserved surprise** (Meade doesn't know objective)
6. **Prepared demolitions** (engineers ready)
7. **Secured route** (Fitzhugh Lee screening Lebanon Valley)

**Everything is ready. Dawn July 10, the army marches for Reading.**
