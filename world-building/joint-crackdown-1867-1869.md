# The Joint Crackdown (1867-1869)

## **PERMANENT LOCK - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The joint crackdown is **real military cooperation**  
carried out with **ice-cold mutual hatred**.

It is the first and last time U.S. and CSA soldiers ever fight **together**  
until the Zimmerman Telegram forces them to do it again in 1917.

## The Answer

Yes, they cooperate, but it is the most reluctant, teeth-grinding, temporary marriage in North-American history.

## How It Works

| Feature | How It Actually Works (1867–1869) | Realism Check |
|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Legal basis** | **Border Pacification Act** (July 1867) – identical law passed by both Congresses within 48 hours of each other. | 10/10 |
| **Command structure** | **Joint Border Commission** – 3 U.S. officers, 3 CSA officers, 1 rotating neutral chair (usually a Sequoyah marshal). | 9/10 |
| **Operational reality** | Mixed patrols: one company U.S. cavalry rides **beside** one company CSA cavalry under a white "truce" flag. | 10/10 – happened OTL 1870s against border bandits |
| **Rules of engagement** | Raiders are **shot or hanged on the spot** – no trials, no prisoners. Both sides agree: "dead raiders tell no tales." | 10/10 – exactly how both armies treated guerrillas |
| **Most infamous joint action** | **Battle of the Red River Ford, 12 April 1868** – 400 raiders cornered by 600 joint troopers. 341 raiders killed, 59 captured and hanged the next morning. | 10/10 |
| **Public spin** | U.S. papers: "Law and order restored."<br>CSA papers: "Yankee invaders finally doing something useful." | 10/10 |

## Tone of the Cooperation

- Officers refuse to salute each other.
- Campfires are separate.
- When a U.S. captain and CSA captain have to share a tent during a storm, they sleep with revolvers on their laps.
- The only thing they agree on is that the raiders have to die.

## Result by Spring 1869

- Organised Northern cells are **exterminated**.
- Leaders publicly hanged in joint ceremonies (one in Richmond, one in Washington).
- The continent breathes a sigh of relief and pretends the whole thing never happened.
