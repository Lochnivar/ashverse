# Ideas & Notes

## Random Ideas
- What if the Great Burning wasn't destruction but transformation? The empire didn't die, it became something else
- The Ashen Hunters might be trying to prevent something worse than what they're doing
- Kaelen's parents might have been trying to prevent his awakening for a reason
- The artifacts might be pieces of a larger whole
- What if there are other "verses" - other worlds or dimensions connected through the ash?

## Research Notes
- Need to research: How do real-world empires fall? What causes civilizations to collapse?
- Ash as a symbol: renewal, death, memory, what remains after destruction
- Magic systems in fantasy: balance between power and cost
- Character arcs: coming of age, accepting responsibility, dealing with legacy

## Questions to Answer
- What really caused the Great Burning?
- Why are Ashborn born with this connection?
- What is Master Vex's true goal?
- Where did Kaelen's parents come from and what were they trying to do?
- Are there other types of magic or power systems?
- What lies beyond the Known Realms?
- Is the Phoenix Prophecy real or just legend?

## Things to Remember
- Ashborn eyes are silver-gray, a rare but not unique trait
- The year is 1000 AB (After Burning)
- Magic requires emotion and will
- Overuse causes ash-sickness
- The Ashen Wastes are dangerous but also hold power
- Official records may be lies or incomplete

## Inspiration
- Post-apocalyptic settings and how societies rebuild
- Stories about inherited power and legacy (Star Wars, etc.)
- Fantasy epics with mystery elements
- Coming-of-age stories with magical elements
- The concept of memory and what remains after destruction

## Plot Holes to Fix
- Need to establish: Why now? Why is Kaelen awakening at this specific time?
- How do the Ashen Hunters track Ashborn?
- What prevents more people from exploring the wastes?
- Why haven't the kingdoms tried to reclaim the wastes?

## Character Development Ideas
- Thorne should have a redemption arc - he was once an Ashen Hunter
- Lyra's mentor might still be alive, held prisoner
- Kaelen should discover he's not the only one - there are other young Ashborn
- Master Corin might know more than he's told Kaelen
- Elder Mara should have a connection to Kaelen's family

## World Building Ideas
- Other kingdoms beyond the Central Kingdoms
- Islands or continents across the sea
- Underground networks of Ashborn
- Ancient creatures that survived the Burning
- The possibility that the empire's magic was too powerful and caused its own destruction

## Dialogue Snippets
- "The past isn't dead. It's just waiting in the ash."
- "You can't escape what you are, only choose what you become."
- "Every fire leaves ash. Every ash holds memory."
- "They fear us because we remember what they've forgotten."

## Scene Ideas
- Kaelen's first uncontrolled use of power - destructive and frightening
- A chase through the Ashen Wastes with ash-storms
- Discovery of an ancient library in the ruins
- Confrontation where Kaelen must choose between hiding and fighting
- A memory-echo showing the final moments of the empire
