## Ashborn Magic

### Overview
Ashborn magic is a unique form of power that draws from the residual energy left behind by the Great Burning. It channels the "memory" of the fallen Ash Empire, allowing practitioners to manipulate ash, fire, and the echoes of ancient power.

### Source of Power
The magic comes from the Ashen Wastes themselves—the ruins, the ash, and the lingering essence of the destroyed empire. Ashborn are born with a connection to this power, though it may remain dormant until awakened.

### Rules & Limitations
- Must be near ash or ruins to use full power (weaker elsewhere)
- Power is tied to emotion and will—stronger when the user is determined or desperate
- Cannot create something from nothing—must work with existing materials
- Overuse causes physical exhaustion and can lead to "ash-sickness"
- Each Ashborn has a unique affinity (some for fire, some for artifacts, some for memory-echoes)

### Types of Magic
- **Ash Manipulation:** Control and shape ash, create constructs, sense through ash
- **Fire Mastery:** Control flames, especially those born from ash
- **Artifact Resonance:** Awaken and communicate with ancient artifacts
- **Memory Echoes:** See glimpses of the past in places of significance
- **Ruin Walking:** Navigate and understand the structure of ancient ruins

### How It's Learned
Mostly instinctual, but can be refined through:
- Meditation and connection with the wastes
- Study of ancient texts (rare)
- Guidance from experienced Ashborn
- Practice and experimentation (dangerous)

### Who Can Use It
Only those born with the Ashborn gift (genetic/hereditary, but not always passed down). Approximately 1 in 10,000 people are Ashborn. The gift can remain dormant for life if never awakened.

### Cost/Consequences
- Physical exhaustion after use
- "Ash-sickness" from overuse: coughing, weakness, gray skin tone
- Emotional drain—using power requires strong emotion
- Risk of losing oneself in memory-echoes
- Attracts attention from dangerous forces

### Visual/Physical Manifestation
- Ash swirls and moves around the user
- Eyes may glow silver-gray when power is active
- Flames burn with unusual colors (silver, gray, or deep red)
- Artifacts glow and respond to touch
- Air shimmers near areas of strong power

## Standard Magic (Non-Ashborn)

### Overview
Traditional magic exists but is rare and different from Ashborn power. It draws from natural sources and requires study and training.

### Source of Power
Natural elements, life force, or learned techniques passed down through schools and traditions.

### Rules & Limitations
- Requires extensive study and training
- Limited by the practitioner's knowledge and skill
- Often requires materials or components
- More reliable but less powerful than Ashborn magic

### Types of Magic
- Elemental magic (earth, water, air)
- Healing magic
- Enchantment and crafting
- Divination (limited)

### Who Can Use It
Anyone with the aptitude and training, but natural talent varies greatly. Much rarer than Ashborn, with only a few hundred practitioners in the known world.

## Notes
- Ashborn magic is feared because it's associated with the destruction of the empire
- The relationship between the two magic systems is not fully understood
- Some believe Ashborn magic is corrupted or dangerous
- Ancient artifacts from the empire can amplify or channel Ashborn power
