## QUICK REFERENCE

### Why Gamble Sees the Withdrawal First

**Colonel William Gamble** (1st Brigade, Buford's Cavalry Division) is the first Union officer to observe Confederate withdrawal on morning of July 2, 1863.

**Time:** ~05:20-05:30 (first light, before full sunrise)  
**Location:** 8th Illinois Cavalry vedettes on western picket line, Mummasburg Road approach

**Key Factors:**
1. Cavalry vedettes already mounted (04:00-04:30)
2. Positioned on the exact road Confederates use
3. 800-1,200 yards from moving column
4. Trained to notice this
5. Infantry looking wrong direction, too far away

### The Discovery Sequence

**05:20:** First vedette contact  
**05:25-05:30:** Report reaches Gamble  
**05:35:** Gamble reports to Buford  
**05:45:** Buford reports to Meade  
**06:00:** Meade receives report  
**06:15-06:30:** Infantry starts noticing independently

---

### Gamble's Shadowing Operation

**Gamble's Force:** ~1,200 cavalry (1st Brigade)  
**Confederate Column:** ~55,000 men, 12-15 mile column

**Buford's Orders:**
> "Maintain contact with Confederate column. Shadow at 1-2 miles distance. Report strength, direction, composition every 30 minutes. Do NOT engage unless attacked."

**Result:** Professional standoff - both sides doing their jobs correctly, Union getting excellent intelligence, no combat.

### The 3-Hour Structural Gap

**Even with perfect Meade response (no 36-hour dither), there's an unavoidable structural gap:**

- **05:20:** Gamble notices withdrawal
- **05:35:** Gamble reports to Buford
- **05:45:** Buford reports to Meade
- **06:00:** Meade receives report, begins issuing orders
- **06:30-07:00:** First infantry units begin organizing
- **08:00-08:30:** First infantry actually on the road in pursuit

**Minimum delay: ~3 hours from discovery to infantry pursuit**

**Meanwhile:**
- Confederate column already moving at 05:20
- Making 2.5 mph (standard column march)
- By 08:00, lead elements 7-9 miles north
- **Gap opens automatically, even with perfect Union response**

---

### Exhaustion Differential (Critical)

**Confederate Status:**
- Moderate exhaustion (4/10)
- 4-week leisurely invasion march (10-15 mi/day)
- Multiple rest days, excellent food
- 62% of force didn't fight July 1 (relatively fresh)
- **Withdrawal capability: GOOD**

**Union Status:**
- Severe exhaustion (7/10)
- 1-week forced interception march (20-30 mi/day)
- Almost no rest, poor food
- Two corps wrecked from July 1 combat
- VI Corps still 30+ miles away
- **Pursuit capability: POOR**

**Result:**
- CSA: 2.5 mph / 5-8% straggling → retains 88% strength over 40 miles
- USA: 2.0-2.5 mph / 15-20% straggling → retains 68% strength over 40 miles
- **20-percentage-point differential makes interception impossible**

### Best Case vs. Actual Scenario

**Best Case (No Dither):**
- Union arrives Harrisburg 4-5 hours after Confederates
- Confederate strength: 48,000
- Union strength: 24,000
- Confederate advantage: 2:1 plus fortified city
- **Harrisburg occupation happens anyway (contested but successful)**

**Actual Scenario (36-Hour Dither):**
- Union pursuit delayed 36 hours
- Confederate lead: 80+ miles
- Harrisburg occupation leisurely (7 days)
- Political catastrophe: "Meade didn't even try"
- **This is what triggers Northern Collapse Sequence**

**Key Insight:** The dither amplifies the disaster but doesn't create it. The structural gap + exhaustion differential already make Confederate escape highly likely. The dither turns "couldn't catch them" into "didn't even try"—transforming military difficulty into political catastrophe.
