# California's Path to Independence

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

California is independent by mid-1873.

Everything that previously said "1920s–1930s" or "1931 Treaty of San Francisco" is old draft residue and is hereby over-written.

California spends the entire 20th century as the rich, smug, Pacific-facing older sibling who has been its own country for 150 years by the time WW1 starts.

No later secession.

No 1930s date.

1872–1873 is locked canon.

## The Geographic Reality (1865)

California in 1865 is already a U.S. state (admitted 1850), overwhelmingly Union-loyal, but **physically cut off** from the rest of the United States by:

- **Sovereign Native super-states** (Dakota, Comanchería, etc.) in the Great Plains
- **The CSA** controlling everything from Arkansas/Texas westward to the Colorado River in some places
- **Mormon Deseret republic** blocking the northern route

**There is no land bridge left.**

## Timeline of California's Evolution

### 1865–1870: De-facto U.S. Exclave
- **Political status:** De-facto **U.S. exclave**
- **How it survives:** Connected only by sea (Panama railway still tiny). Federal troops and navy keep it loyal.
- **Realism check:** 10/10

### 1870–1872: Growing De-facto Independence
- **Political status:** Growing **de-facto independence**
- **What happens:** Transcontinental railroad is **never built** (or built much later and under joint U.S./Native control). California starts acting like a separate country in practice.
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### January–May 1872: Great Native Toll War
- **Trigger:** Native super-states triple railroad tolls → California trade strangled
- **Result:** California realizes it cannot depend on land routes controlled by Native nations

### 5 November 1872: California Independence Referendum
- **Result:** 69% vote YES
- **Why it works:** The North has no army within 1,500 miles, no political will for another civil war, and needs California's ports for trade.

### 14 February 1873: Treaty of San Francisco Signed
- **Event:** Peaceful secession formalised
- **Terms:** See `world-building/treaty-of-san-francisco.md` for full details. California leaves the Union peacefully. U.S. keeps military bases under 99-year lease (San Diego, Mare Island, Presidio of San Francisco).
- **The vibe:** Amicable divorce. Both sides shake hands and get rich together.

### 4 July 1873: Republic of California Fully Sovereign
- **Event:** Independence Day chosen deliberately
- **Status:** Fully independent **Republic of California**

### 1873–2025: Independent Republic
- **Political status:** Fully independent Republic of California
- **Characteristics:** Rich, neutral, Singapore-with-redwoods, speaks English with a Spanish accent
- **Relationship with U.S.:** Like post-independence Ireland treats Britain — family, but not the same house
- **Realism check:** 9/10

## Why the North Lets It Happen Without Firing a Shot

1. **Geography** – no land corridor, no way to march an army there.
2. **Money** – California is already bankrolling half the remaining U.S. debt with gold/oil/port fees. War would bankrupt the North instantly.
3. **Precedent** – the South already proved secession is legal when you win. California just does it **cleaner**.
4. **Public opinion** – after the 1861–65 bloodbath, no Northerner wants to die for "keeping the Pacific coast in the Union."

## Oregon and Washington Stay U.S.

**Important:** California does **not** take Oregon and Washington with it when it leaves.

### Why Oregon/Washington Don't Follow California

1. **Different migration streams** – Oregon Trail settlers were overwhelmingly Midwestern Yankees who hated slavery and the South.
2. **Economic ties** – their natural trade is down the Columbia River and north to British Columbia, not south to San Francisco.
3. **Military reality** – after California goes independent, the U.S. **needs** Puget Sound naval bases (Bremerton) and Portland's port. They'll fight to keep them.
4. **Cultural identity** – Pacific Northwest develops its own "rain-soaked, lumberjack, Scandinavian-socialist" identity separate from California's "sun-drenched gold-rush" culture.

### Outcome

When California secedes, Oregon and Washington **stay in the Union** but become the U.S.'s **semi-autonomous Pacific frontier** — heavily militarized, rich from timber/shipping/tech, and quietly resentful of East-Coast meddling but never quite willing to burn the bridge.

## The "Good Riddance" Dynamic

By 1872–1873, the dynamic is less "California bravely declares independence" and more **"California, please, for the love of God, take your movie stars and leave"** from the rest of the fractured U.S.

### Who Wants California Gone

- **Oregon & Washington:** Tired of San Francisco treating the Columbia River like its private shipping lane and Portland like a suburb.
- **The remaining U.S. (East Coast):** California sends almost no taxes east anymore anyway, but still demands federal navy protection and screams when it doesn't get it.
- **Native super-states:** Prefer one big, predictable neighbour to the south-west over a sprawling, land-hungry U.S. that keeps eyeing the Plains.
- **The CSA:** Happy to see the North lose its richest chunk of its economy and its only real Pacific ports.

### The Divorce

By the time the referendum happens (5 November 1872), the rest of the continent is basically holding the door open and saying:

**"Here's your hat, here's your coat, don't let the Golden Gate hit you on the way out."**

California thinks it's a triumphant declaration of independence. Everyone else treats it like a long-overdue eviction.

Joint press release, 14 February 1873:

**"The United States and the Republic of California have agreed to a peaceful and mutually beneficial separation, effective 4 July 1873. Both nations look forward to a continued close relationship."**

Translation from the U.S. side, whispered in every bar from Seattle to Boston:

**"Good riddance, you insufferable rich bastards. Don't call us, we'll call you."**

No shots fired. No hard feelings (officially). Just the quietest, pettiest, most lucrative break-up in history.

## The North America Equivalent of Australia

California ends up as the **North America equivalent of Australia**:
- Started as a loyal colony
- Grew too rich and too far away
- Quietly became its own thing while still waving the old flag when convenient

## Characteristics

- **No land bridge. Sea and air only.**
- **Rich, smug, and increasingly its own country.**
- **The U.S.'s golden exclave that slowly turns into a Pacific superpower in all but name.**

## Notes

This is not a dramatic secession. It's a gradual drift born of geographic necessity. California doesn't rebel—it just drifts away, becoming too rich, too isolated, and too independent to be effectively controlled from Washington.

By 1873, it's the Republic of California, fully independent and recognized.

By the time of The Ashes (1939), California has been its own country for 66 years—the rich, smug, Pacific-facing older sibling who has been its own country for 150 years by the time WW1 starts.
