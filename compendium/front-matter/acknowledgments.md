## STRUCTURE

### Opening
"The present writer wishes to acknowledge the tireless efforts of his editorial staff, without whom this volume would have been considerably longer, significantly less readable, and potentially unpublishable."

### Auto (A.U.T.O.)
"Mr. Archibald Ulysses Theophilus Oswald served as archival assistant and first line of defense against my worst impulses. His condensations were generally reasonable, occasionally inspired, and rarely appreciated in the moment. I have come to understand that 'for the reader's sanity' is a valid editorial principle, however much I may have questioned it at the time."

### Kronvoldt (G.R.O.K.)
"Mr. Gervais Rogerus Oscar Kronvoldt served as research assistant and bearer of unfortunate truths regarding publishing realities. His patient explanations that 'paper costs money' and 'bindings have physical limitations' were delivered with a tact I did not always deserve. At the advice and consent of G.R.O.K., several hundred pages of footnotes now reside in supplementary appendices where they belong. I have grudgingly conceded he was correct."

### Claudette (C.B.O.)
"Miss Claudette Beatrice Oswald served as external peer reviewer and final arbiter of disputes I had convinced myself were matters of scholarly principle. Her observation that my ninety-three-page Wilson analysis contained 'valuable insights surrounded by personal vendetta masquerading as scholarship' was both devastating and accurate. The revised twenty-three-page version is stronger for her intervention, though I will never admit this to her face."

### Appomattox Collegial Press
"To Appomattox Collegial Press, who maintained remarkable patience when informed that my 'nearly complete' manuscript was 1,400 pages and growing, I offer my gratitude and mild resentment. Your insistence on a 1,000-page limit was commercially prudent and artistically constraining. I have been informed these are not contradictory statements."

### Other Acknowledgments
- Sequoyah Historical Society
- Joint USA-CSA Historical Commission
- County clerks (the seventeen who thought he was "with the Revenue")
- Wife (who tolerated 23 years of dinner conversations about cotton prices)

### Closing
"Any errors remaining in this text are the fault of Mr. Oswald, who was supposed to catch them. His note that 'errors are the author's responsibility' has been acknowledged and filed under 'Technically Correct But Unhelpful.'"
