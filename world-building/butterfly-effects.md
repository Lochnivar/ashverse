# Butterfly Effects and OTL Assumptions

## The Honest Rule

Yes, we **are** playing "leap butterflies" if we let the world outside North America stay on OTL rails past about 1900–1910.

## Realistic Butterfly Ceiling in the NTL

| Year range | Maximum safe assumption | What starts breaking if you push further |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **1863–1880** | Almost zero foreign butterflies. Europe, Japan, Latin America, etc. run **exactly** like OTL. | None – POD is purely North American |
| **1880–1900** | Minor ripples (U.S. & CSA weaker → slightly less European immigration, slightly different capital flows) | Europe still follows OTL trajectory (no major wars prevented) |
| **1900–1914** | Noticeable but not fatal changes (weaker U.S. → less mediation in Morocco crises, slightly slower Dreadnought race) | WWI still happens on schedule, but alliances and entry timing start wobbling |
| **1914–1939** | **Hard butterfly wall** – everything is up for grabs. No guarantee of OTL WWI, WWII, Hitler, etc. | Assuming OTL European wars past 1914 is no longer honest alt-history |

## The Honest Rule for Your Timeline

- Up to **1900** you can keep the world 95–100% OTL with only tiny tweaks.
- 1900–1914 you get **one or two** noticeable divergences (e.g., slower naval race, different Morocco crises outcome).
- **1914 onward** you are in full "choose your own adventure" territory. Keeping OTL WWI and WWII is **possible** but no longer default.

## Realistic 1900–2025 Foreign Policy Menu (Pick One, Not All)

| Option | Butterfly level | What you get to keep vs. what you lose |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Minimal butterflies** (world wars happen on schedule) | Medium | Keep WWI & WWII dates, but U.S. role is tiny or non-existent |
| **Moderate butterflies** (WWI delayed or smaller, WWII avoided) | High | Europe stabilises earlier, no Hitler, Japan still expands but slower |
| **Maximum butterflies** (total scramble) | Very high | No WWI as we know it, colonial empires last longer, different superpowers by 2025 |

## Recommended Approach: Moderate Butterflies

Stick to **moderate butterflies**:

- WWI happens roughly on schedule (1914–1918) but is shorter and less bloody (no U.S. entry = no 1918 knockout blow).
- No Hitler (German defeat is less humiliating).
- Japan still rises, still invades China 1937, still gets California oil → still dominates Pacific without a 1941 Pearl Harbor.

That keeps the 20th century **recognisable enough** for readers while staying honest about the 1863 POD finally hitting Europe 50 years later.

## The Line

**1863–1900:** world 95% OTL  
**1900–August 1914:** 80% OTL  
**1914 onward:** choose your own adventure, but **never** assume OTL wars happen on the same dates with the same players.

That's the line.

Cross it and the devil starts swinging.

Stay on it and you're bulletproof.
