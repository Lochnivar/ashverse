## NTL Divergence
- **Gettysburg:** July 1-2, 1863: Present but different circumstances (battle only one day)
- **Pennsylvania Campaign - York Dash (July 17, 1863):** Forward cavalry screen at York. Bold dash across Columbia/Wrightsville ford - succeeds in forcing crossing, evades Hampton/Fitz Lee skirmishers, raids Longstreet's rear wagons, gathers intel. Partial success - inflicts minor damage (~200-400 Confederate casualties), but at cost (~300-500 Union losses). Withdraws after sharp skirmish. **Saber Shattered:** Rifle round shatters saber blade mid-charge - personal close call, brief reflection on mortality. Keeps hilt as token. Press darling ("Custer's Wolverines Raid Rebel Rear!") - rare Union tactical bright spot.
- **Warren Era - Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign (August-September 1863):** Serves under Warren during campaign - aggressive cavalry actions, but less decisive than OTL
- **Rapidan Rout Horrors (September 13-15, 1863):** As diversion scouts commander (Michigan Brigade), leads aggressive probes at Raccoon Ford during Phase 4. Witnesses botched assault: men drowning in mud, wounded abandoned, brigade shattered. Shocks him - sees war's human cost beyond personal glory.
- **Pickett's Lightning Raid (June-July 1864):** Promoted to division command after cavalry clash at Wrightsville (July 1863—Custer's dash kills Hampton; rare Union success). Leads counter-cavalry charge against Pickett's raiders - bold but reckless. **Major Wound:** Minie ball shatters shoulder/thigh during failed charge; brigade cut to pieces by Hampton. Realization of responsibility for losses. Hospital recovery - haunted by guilt, but climbs back on horse post-recovery, wiser (balances boldness with caution).
- **Grant's Final Gamble:** February 18-20, 1865: Commands cavalry brigade in desperate assault
- **The Reckless Charge:** Makes glory-hunting charge against Longstreet's lines, gets cut to pieces by Hampton's superior cavalry
- **Survives War:** Unlike OTL Little Bighorn, survives but reputation damaged by reckless failures
- **Post-War:** Survives Appomattox; haunted by losses, contributes to Appomattox mythos as wiser veteran (1909+). As instructor/figurehead at joint USA-CSA academy: Teaches cavalry tactics, emphasizes responsibility - "Charge when you must, but know the cost. I learned too late." Saber hilt/letter opener on desk - symbol of growth from reckless youth to reflective veteran.
