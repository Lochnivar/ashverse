## CRITICAL CONFLICTS

### 1. PICKETT'S RAID DATES ⚠️ **MAJOR CONFLICT**

**New Document (`picketts-raid-timeline.md`):**
- **Dates:** June 14 - July 22, 1864
- **Duration:** 38 days
- **Force:** 14,000 men

**Established Canon:**
- **Dates:** June 8-28, 1864
- **Duration:** 21 days
- **Force:** 18k men + all cavalry

**Conflict:** 
- Start date differs by 6 days (June 8 vs June 14)
- End date differs by 6 days (July 28 vs July 22)
- Duration differs by 17 days (21 vs 38)
- Force size differs by ~4,000 men (18k vs 14k)

**Impact:** This is a fundamental conflict that affects:
- Timeline consistency
- Force size calculations
- Campaign duration
- Integration with other events (Hancock wounded July 12)

**Recommendation:** User must decide which timeline to use. The new document is much more detailed and internally consistent, but conflicts with established canon dates.

### 2. PICKETT'S RAID FORCE SIZE ⚠️ **CONFLICT**

**New Document:**
- **Force:** 14,000 men total
  - Pickett's Division: ~5,500 (mounted infantry)
  - Fitzhugh Lee's Cavalry: ~2,500
  - Lomax's Cavalry: ~2,000
  - Horse Artillery: ~600 (24 guns)
  - Pioneers: ~400
  - Reserve horses: ~2,500 (not men)

**Established Canon:**
- **Force:** 18k men + all cavalry

**Conflict:** 
- New document: 14,000 men
- Established canon: 18,000+ men (18k + "all cavalry" suggests even more)

**Assessment:** The new document's breakdown (14,000 men) is more detailed and internally consistent. The "18k + all cavalry" in established canon may be an approximation or include additional cavalry not detailed in the new document.

**Recommendation:** If accepting new document, update established canon to reflect 14,000 men. If keeping established canon, new document needs revision.

### 3. GRANT'S FINAL GAMBLE TIMING ⚠️ **POTENTIAL CONFLICT**

**New Document (`final-gasp-timeline.md`):**
- **Mentions:** "May 1865: Grant's desperate Shenandoah Valley gamble (final Union offensive)"
- **Context:** After McClellan's inauguration (March 4, 1865), during peace negotiations

**Established Canon:**
- **Grant's Final Gamble:** Late January - February 1865
- **Battle of Appomattox:** February 18-20, 1865
- **Grant surrenders:** February 20, 1865

**Conflict:** 
- New document mentions Grant's "Shenandoah Valley gamble" in May 1865
- Established canon has Grant's Final Gamble in January-February 1865 (ends with surrender at Appomattox)

**Assessment:** These may be:
1. **Different events:** Grant's Final Gamble (Jan-Feb 1865) vs Grant's Shenandoah Gamble (May 1865)
2. **Same event, wrong date:** Final-gasp document has incorrect date
3. **User's note:** User said "We already have Grant's Gamble which fits after final-gasp" - suggesting Grant's Gamble comes AFTER the final-gasp period

**Recommendation:** Clarify with user:
- Is Grant's Shenandoah Gamble (May 1865) different from Grant's Final Gamble (Jan-Feb 1865)?
- Or should final-gasp document be updated to reflect established Grant's Final Gamble timeline?

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Pickett's Raid Timeline (`picketts-raid-timeline.md`)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Extremely detailed and internally consistent
- ✅ Provides day-by-day breakdown
- ✅ Includes force composition, casualties, infrastructure destroyed
- ✅ Explains strategic vision and tactical execution
- ✅ Connects to political impact (McClellan's victory)

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Conflicts with established canon dates (June 8-28 vs June 14-July 22)
- ⚠️ Conflicts with established canon force size (18k vs 14k)
- ⚠️ Duration (38 days) much longer than established canon (21 days)

**Recommendation:** If accepting new timeline, it's superior in detail and consistency. But requires updating all established canon references.

---

### Final Gasp Timeline (`final-gasp-timeline.md`)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Covers important period (November 1864 - May 1865)
- ✅ Details election, inauguration, peace negotiations
- ✅ Explains "long wait" period
- ✅ Desertion statistics provided
- ✅ Connects to Grant's Gamble

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Mentions Grant's "Shenandoah Valley gamble" in May 1865
- ⚠️ Established canon has Grant's Final Gamble in January-February 1865
- ⚠️ User says Grant's Gamble "fits after final-gasp" - needs clarification

**Recommendation:** Clarify Grant's Gamble timing. If it's May 1865, update established canon. If it's January-February 1865, update final-gasp document.

---

## INTEGRATION ISSUES

### Timeline Sequence Questions:

1. **Pickett's Raid ends:** July 22, 1864 (new doc) vs July 28, 1864 (established canon)
   - **Impact:** Affects when Hancock can pursue and when he gets wounded

2. **Hancock wounded:** July 12, 1864 (both agree)
   - **Question:** If raid ends July 22, Hancock wounded July 12 is during the raid (makes sense)
   - **Question:** If raid ends July 28, Hancock wounded July 12 is also during the raid (makes sense)
   - **Both work, but dates need resolution**

3. **Grant's Gamble:** January-February 1865 (established) vs May 1865 (final-gasp mentions)
   - **Critical:** These cannot both be true unless they're different events

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Resolve Date Conflicts

**Pickett's Raid:**
- **Option A:** Accept new document (June 14 - July 22, 1864, 38 days, 14,000 men)
  - Update all established canon references
  - More detailed and internally consistent
- **Option B:** Keep established canon (June 8-28, 1864, 21 days, 18k men)
  - New document needs revision to match

**Recommendation:** **Option A** - New document is superior in detail and consistency.

---

### Priority 2: Clarify Grant's Gamble

**Questions for User:**
1. Is Grant's "Shenandoah Valley gamble" (May 1865) different from Grant's "Final Gamble" (Jan-Feb 1865)?
2. Or should final-gasp document be updated to reflect established Grant's Final Gamble timeline?
3. User said Grant's Gamble "fits after final-gasp" - does this mean it's AFTER May 1865, or after the final-gasp period ends?

**Recommendation:** Clarify with user before updating documents.

---

### Priority 3: Update Established Canon (If New Documents Accepted)

**Files Needing Updates:**
1. `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` - Update Pickett's Raid dates and force size
