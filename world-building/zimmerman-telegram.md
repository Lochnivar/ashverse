# The Zimmerman Telegram Analogue in the NTL

## Why It's Even Stupider Than OTL

The OTL Zimmerman Telegram was already **cartoonishly stupid**:
- Sent over a cable Germany **knew** the British controlled
- Offered Mexico territory it had **zero chance** of conquering
- Assumed the U.S. would just shrug at an invasion from the south
- Written by a foreign minister (Zimmermann) who then **publicly confirmed it was real** when asked

In the NTL it's **even stupider**, because Germany now has to bribe **three** separate American governments, including one (California) that's richer than most European powers and another (CSA) that's spent a decade begging the world to forget it ever liked slavery.

## The NTL Telegram (Late 1916–Early 1917)

| OTL Zimmerman Telegram (Jan 1917) | NTL Zimmerman Telegram analogue | Effect |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| Germany offers Mexico Texas/Arizona/New Mexico if Mexico attacks U.S. | Germany offers **both** the CSA and Mexico huge territorial gains if they attack the fractured U.S. and keep it out of the war. | 10/10 |
| Sent to Mexico via U.S. cable | Sent to Mexico City **and** Richmond (CSA capital) via the same British-controlled cables. British intercept **both**. | 10/10 |
| Britain decrypts and hands to U.S. | Britain decrypts **both** and hands copies to **Washington, Richmond, and Sacramento** (California) with a polite "you're welcome" note. | 10/10 |

## Realistic Content of the NTL Telegram (1916–17)

> "In the event of war with the United States we propose an alliance…  
> To the Confederate States: restoration of Kentucky, Missouri, and the Indian Territory.  
> To Mexico: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona.  
> To the Republic of California: we make no claims.  
> Generous financial support and an undertaking to restore lost territories will be given."

## Fallout (1917)

| Recipient | Reaction |
|-----------|----------|
| **U.S. (East)** | Outrage → immediate war fever. |
| **CSA** | **Furious betrayal** – they've spent a decade crawling back into the world's good graces. This telegram makes them look like German puppets again. |
| **California** | Laughs its ass off – Germany just told the richest nation on the Pacific "we won't touch you" while offering everyone else scraps. |

## The Native Super-States Reaction

Germany including the sovereign Native super-states in the telegram is **perfect, hilarious proof** that Berlin has **zero clue** how North America actually works in 1917.

| What the telegram says (Berlin's fantasy) | What every Native nation hears |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Restoration of Indian Territory to its rightful owners" | "You just offered to give us back land we already own, you idiots." |

### Realistic Reaction from the Super-States

| Super-State | Reaction when the telegram is made public |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | National Council votes **unanimously** to declare war on Germany the same week. Sends two regiments of light cavalry (Cherokee/Choctaw "Foreign Legion") to fight under U.S./CSA colours. |
| **Dakota** | Lakota delegation in war-bonnets shows up at the U.S. recruitment office: "We heard you're fighting the people who think we're your pets." |
| **Comanchería** | Comanche captains laugh for three days, then send 800 riders "to see what German horses taste like." |
| **Navajo** | Quietly sends sharpshooters who never miss. |

## Result

- CSA and California both declare war on Germany **within weeks** – not because they love each other, but because Germany just handed them the perfect excuse to look like good guys
- First real U.S.–CSA military cooperation in history (joint naval patrols in the Atlantic)
- The Native super-states are **insulted** that anyone thinks they need Germany to "restore" land they never lost
- They declare war on Germany **faster than anyone else** on the continent
- U.S. and CSA suddenly have **elite, motivated auxiliary troops** they never expected (think OTL French Foreign Legion, but with war-bonnets and better marksmanship)
- War ends faster (1917–18) because Germany now faces **three** American navies and whatever troops the CSA can spare

## The Perfect Stupidity

Germany doesn't just shoot itself in the foot.

It blows off its own head and hands the smoking gun to the USA, CSA, and California with a polite note that says **"Please aim here."**

The NTL Zimmerman Telegram is the OTL version on bath-salt-grade stupid.

And it's the single event that finally, brutally, forces the three American republics to fight the same war, on the same side, at the same time.

Germany hands the Allies the best light cavalry on the planet because some desk general in Berlin looked at a 1870s map and thought "Indian Territory" was still a thing.
