## The 1985 Compendium

### What It Is
**A mockumentary compendium** - a separate product from the main AshVerse novels, meant to be a companion piece that explores deeper into the NTL (New Timeline) point of divergence and assumptions made by the author when developing the story.

### Concept
**"Behind the Scenes with a side of snark for flavor"**
- The actual text itself is perfectly readable and informative
- The snark lies in forewords and footnotes that are meant to be humorous
- A satirical take on academic writing and historical compendiums

### Title
**"Fire and Sovereignty: The Long Collapse of Chattel Slavery in an Independent Confederate States, 1865–1894"**

### Publisher (In-Universe)
**Richmond University Press**  
in cooperation with the Joint USA–CSA Historical Commission  
**1985**

### Publishing Imprint
**Appomattox Collegial Press**  
(an imprint of the Appomattox College of History and Strategy)  
**Appomattox Court House, Confederate States of America**

### Publishing Cities
**Richmond ∙ Atlanta ∙ New Orleans ∙ Boston**  
*(Note: Boston gets the courtesy of a seat at the table, but it's still the lone Yankee in a room full of magnolias)*

### Purpose
- Explore deeper into the NTL point of divergence
- Examine assumptions made by the author when developing the story
- Provide "Behind the Scenes" content
- Add humor through satirical forewords and footnotes
- The main text is serious and readable; the humor is in the framing

---

## Character Personality

### Academic Style & Humor
- **Rowan Atkinson-style humor:** Straight-faced, earnest delivery that becomes absurdist through contrast
- Deadpan seriousness about absurd topics
- The more serious and earnest he is, the funnier it becomes
- Dry, slightly sardonic academic voice
- Straight-faced, aristocratic venom
- 55-year-old retired Confederate general turned academic
- Obsessed with genealogical purity and archival discipline
- **Key:** He never breaks character - he's completely serious, which makes the absurdity funnier

### Family Connection
- **Fairfax-Lockwood line** - Descending from the unimpeachable Northern Neck proprietary
- Reinforced by the Sequoyah cadastral records
- Presents a pedigree of "almost monastic clarity"
- Every birth, marriage, and land patent attested in triplicate
- Marginalia in the hand of no fewer than three county clerks

### Academic Reputation
- Known for scholarly serenity (until the Jacobus incident)
- Defensive about family pedigree
- Willing to make pointed academic jabs at other families (especially the Meades)

---

## The Jacobus Incident (1986)

### The Scene
**Appomattox College of History and Strategy, Spring 1986**  
Annual Lecture: "Fire and Sovereignty: A Reappraisal"

### What Happens
Dr. General Fairfax-Lockwood is halfway through his usual 20-minute peroration on the unimpeachable clarity of the Fairfax-Lockwood pedigree when a graduate student in the third row—some cheeky Yankee exchange scholar from Syracuse—raises his hand and asks, with perfect innocence:

> "General Fairfax-Lockwood, how do you reconcile your family's celebrated archival purity with Donald Lines Jacobus's rather pointed 1954 article on the Atrocious Lockwood Blunder?"

### Fairfax-Lockwood's Reaction
- Freezes mid-sentence, water glass at his lips
- A beat of perfect silence
- Chokes, sprays an arc of water clear over the first row
- Entire auditorium erupts
- Wipes his mouth with the back of a hand still wearing the faded gray cuff of his 1950s dress uniform
- Fixes the student with a glare that could peel paint
- Growls: "Young man, that particular blunder was perpetrated by a branch of the family so distant they might as well have been Meades. My line descends from the Virginia Fairfaxes and the Sequoyah Lockwoods—pure as the driven snow and twice as cold. Next question."

### The Aftermath
- The hall loses it
- The exchange student becomes campus legend
- Somewhere in the back row, an elderly lady in a lavender hat—who happens to be a descendant of the very branch Jacobus demolished—quietly stands up and applauds
- The lecture is never quite the same after that
- Neither is Dr. General Fairfax-Lockwood's reputation for scholarly serenity

## The Famous Footnote

### Context
Placed somewhere in Chapter 7 of the 1985 paper, right after a mention of the Meade family's "persistent but regrettably muddled" genealogical pretensions.

### The Footnote
> * One is continually struck, in the course of this research, by the curious contrast in the archival discipline exhibited by the two principal families under examination. The Fairfax-Lockwood line, descending as it does from the unimpeachable Northern Neck proprietary and subsequently reinforced by the Sequoyah cadastral records, presents a pedigree of almost monastic clarity: every birth, marriage, and land patent attested in triplicate, with marginalia in the hand of no fewer than three county clerks.  
> 
> The Meades of Philadelphia, by contrast, appear to have treated their family tree with the same cavalier disregard they once displayed for Confederate property rights. One encounters, with distressing frequency, individuals who are simultaneously recorded as deceased in 1849 and remarried in 1857, or listed as the son of two different fathers depending upon which branch of the clan one consults.  
> 
> It is perhaps unsurprising that a family so practiced in the art of creative reorganization should have produced the very men who, in the 1860s and 1870s, excelled at reorganizing other people's barns with kerosene.  
> 
> The present author, secure in the knowledge that his own descent may be traced without ambiguity from Lord Fairfax's land office to the present day (and, one might add, without the necessity of inventing any additional grandfathers), feels no compulsion to pursue the matter further.
> 
> M.J.F.L.

### Style
- **Rowan Atkinson-style delivery:** Completely straight-faced and earnest
- The more serious he is about absurd topics, the funnier it becomes
- Delivered with the straightest of faces
- The driest of prose
- Exactly the amount of aristocratic venom that only a 55-year-old retired Confederate general turned academic can muster
- **Never breaks character** - he's completely serious, which makes the genealogical jabs and academic pretensions absurdly funny

## The KKK/Night Riders Footnote

### Context
A single paragraph in the 1985 paper that becomes the darkest, most chilling footnote in the whole compendium.

### The Footnote
> Had General Forrest survived his 1877 encounter on the Hatchie River, or had the Night Rider cells persisted another five years under unified leadership, it is not difficult to imagine the movement metastasizing into a permanent, quasi-official apparatus of racial terror across the lower Confederacy. The combination of economic desperation, widespread armament, and a ready-made mythology of "Yankee invasion and negro betrayal" provided fertile soil for precisely the sort of hooded, nocturnal order that plagued the United States in our own history under a different name. That it was extinguished in its infancy owes less to moral enlightenment than to the fortunate coincidence of a bullet and the rapid collapse of the institution the Riders were formed to protect. Future historians would do well to remember that monsters are not born immortal; they are merely allowed to live.
> 
> — M.J.L., Richmond, 1985

### Purpose
- Lets the in-universe scholar show intellectual honesty
- Gives the reader a shiver of recognition without ever letting the Klan exist in the timeline
- Quietly reminds everyone that the brighter path was contingent, not inevitable

## The Woodrow Wilson Journal Entry (1923)

### Context
From the private journal of Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Hoyt, Sequoyah, 1923  
(published in the 1985 compendium footnotes, p. 412)

### The Entry
> "Certain Northern journals still speak of Professor Woodrow Wilson as though he were a statesman of note.  
> 
> I have read his published lectures on 'self-determination of nations' and his curious pamphlet advocating a permanent congress of powers — ideas he circulated in the late teens, if memory serves.  
> 
> I am obliged to observe that I have seldom encountered a more perfect specimen of that peculiar Yankee vice: the belief that the world's ills may be cured by sufficiently eloquent moral posturing.  
> 
> The man appears to think that history is a debating society and that mankind is improved by being lectured at length by a Virginian who affects to have discovered virtue only after moving to New Jersey.  
> 
> In short, Mr. Wilson is the only living soul for whom I harbour a more profound contempt than I do for the average Boston abolitionist — and that, sir, is a distinction I had not thought possible.  
> 
> I have instructed my heirs that, should any monument to this gentleman ever be erected within the bounds of Sequoyah, it is to be quietly demolished and the marble reused for hitching posts."

### Footnote 47 (same page)
"The present writer considers Mr. Wilson's proposed 'league of nations' the most amusing flight of academic fancy since the phlogiston theory. One awaits with interest the day California is asked to submit its trade policy to a committee chaired by a Belgian."

### Purpose
- Shows Wilson exists in NTL, but is just a pompous Princeton professor
- No Fourteen Points, no League of Nations, no presidency
- Just academic writings that nobody takes seriously (the 1920 equivalent of a Substack that everyone uses for kindling)
- Perfect example of Fairfax-Lockwood's dry, sardonic, aristocratic voice
- The contempt is legendary and hilarious
- The marble monument/hitching post line is pure Fairfax-Lockwood venom

### NTL Status
- Wilson's still a prick
- Fairfax-Lockwood's contempt is still legendary
- And the timeline stays exactly as canon as the Bear Flag

---

## Notes

- **Author's Namesake Connection:** Lockwood is part of the author's last name (Fairfax-Lockwood), which opens possibilities for personal connections, inside jokes, or special treatment
- **Character Arc:** From scholarly serenity to public embarrassment (Jacobus incident)
- **Academic Voice:** Dry, sardonic, aristocratic, with just enough venom to be memorable
- **Humor Style:** Rowan Atkinson-style - straight-faced, earnest delivery that becomes absurdist through contrast
- **Key Principle:** He never breaks character - completely serious about absurd topics, which makes it funnier
- **Family Pride:** Obsessed with genealogical purity, defensive about family reputation
- **Meta-Framing Device:** Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood is a fictional character who "writes" the compendium - he does NOT appear in the actual novels, only as the compendium's author
- **Not In-Story:** He is not part of the narrative timeline (1863-1939) - he exists only as a meta-framing device for the companion book
- **Compendium Structure:** 
  - Main text: Serious, readable, informative
  - Forewords: Snarky, satirical, humorous (Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's voice)
  - Footnotes: Where most of the humor lives (Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's voice)
  - The actual historical content is legitimate; the framing is satirical

## LOCKED CANON FOOTNOTES

### **Grant's "Blatantly Illegal Orders" (1985 Compendium, Page 487, Paragraph 4)**

**LOCKED CANON - FINAL VERSION**

From the 1985 compendium footnotes, page 487, paragraph 4 (final version):

> "It has been fashionable among certain Northern historians to describe Lieutenant General Grant's march of March 1865 as 'rogue', 'extra-constitutional', or even 'an act of treason'.  
> 
> One is compelled to observe that the phrase 'blatantly illegal orders' possesses a certain ring of oxymoron when issued by a man who, whatever the paperwork in Washington may have claimed, remained the only Union officer in the field still capable of giving orders that sixty-five thousand armed men considered worth obeying.  
> 
> We are continually instructed that it is every officer's sacred duty to disobey illegal orders.  
> 
> Quite so.  
> 
> Yet in the spring of 1865 the officers of the United States Army discovered, to their evident relief, that the only order they felt morally obliged to obey was the one that came from the general who still possessed an army.  
> 
> Legality, like virginity, is a condition more often asserted than demonstrated.  
> 
> In the spring of 1865 the United States government discovered, to its considerable embarrassment, that it had mislaid both.  
> 
> Grant did not seize power.  
> 
> Power, finding itself orphaned, simply followed the only parent still willing to claim it.  
> 
> One suspects the Confederate reception committee at Appomattox Court House was considerably less troubled by the constitutional niceties than were the gentlemen in Washington who had spent the previous year declaring Grant relieved of command while carefully neglecting to relieve him of his army.  
> 
> History, as usual, is unkind to those who mistake parchment for power."

**Signed:**  
Dr. Gen. Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, etc., etc.  
Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy  
(Professor Emeritus, and still not apologising)

**Note:** The "every officer's duty to disobey illegal orders" line is delivered with maximum Fairfax-Lockwood venom. It's the perfect jab: the North's own sacred rule turned against them in the most humiliating way possible.

## LOCKED CANON: THE SACRED TYPEWRITER CLAUSE

**LOCKED CANON - FINAL VERSION**

From the compendium's front matter, footnote 3 (updated to include Claudette):

> "The General's 1937 Underwood Standard, upon which every sacred manuscript is personally hammered out, is hereby declared **off-limits** to all research and archival assistants.  
> 
> Neither Mr. Kronvoldt nor the Archival Assistant (commonly known as "Auto") is ever permitted to lay a finger upon its hallowed keys.  
> 
> **Exception:** Miss Claudette Beatrice Oswald, in her capacity as External Peer-Review Fellow, is granted **permission** to touch the sacred typewriter when conducting her independent reviews. This exception is made under protest by the General, who has been heard to remark that 'the Board of Regents has weaponized typography against me.'  
> 
> This rule is not a matter of trust; it is a matter of **ritual purity**.  
> 
> The General has been heard to remark that he would sooner allow a Yankee cavalry raid through his study than permit a subordinate's hands to profane the instrument that has produced seventeen volumes of unassailable truth (and one small pamphlet on the moral failings of Woodrow Wilson).  
> 
> Accordingly, all corrections, marginalia, and emergency whisky deliveries must be tendered in handwritten form and placed upon the silver tray provided for that purpose.  
> 
> The typewriter remains, as it has since 1937, **the General's alone** (except when Miss Oswald is conducting her reviews, which the General accepts with visible reluctance)."

**Signed:**  
G. R. O. Kronvoldt, M.Litt. (Oxon.), etc.  
A. U. T. Oswald ("Auto")  
C. B. Oswald (with a little heart ♡)

**Note:** This is a nod to the project's "Golden Rule" - the staffers (AI assistants) never touch the original creative work (the books), only work in supporting roles (the edits/compendium). The sacred typewriter represents the original manuscripts (the books folder), and the staffers can only provide handwritten notes on a silver tray (the edits folder). The Golden Rule lives in 1985 diegetic form. **Never to be violated.**

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING - NOT LOCKED  
**Use as satirical framing device for companion compendium/book**
