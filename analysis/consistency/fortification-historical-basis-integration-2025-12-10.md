## LOCKED CANON STATEMENT

**For Compendium (Appendix F or footnote):**

> General Lee, in May 1863, issued explicit written orders for the Rappahannock-Rapidan line to be fortified in case the army was forced to retire from Pennsylvania.  
>  
> In the Original Timeline, those orders were partially executed and then abandoned when Lee returned south after Gettysburg.  
>  
> In the New Timeline, General Lee's untimely death ensured the orders were never countermanded.  
>  
> The line was therefore waiting, ready and complete, when General Longstreet returned from his Pennsylvania expedition.  
>  
> One is almost tempted to call it Providence.  
>  
> "Insurance" comes rather closer.

## HISTORICAL SOURCES

**OTL Orders:**
- **15 May 1863** - Lee to Seddon (*OR*, Series I, Vol. 25, Part 2, p. 802)
- **20 May 1863** - Lee to Davis (*OR*, Series I, Vol. 25, Part 2, p. 809)

**OTL Practice:**
- Longstreet's defensive fortification was standard procedure
- D.H. Hill's detachment was real OTL force (12-15,000 men)
- Hill was recalled in early June 1863 OTL (never recalled in NTL)

## PLAUSIBILITY ASSESSMENT

**Plausibility: 100%** ✅

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Based on **verbatim OTL orders** from Lee
2. ✅ D.H. Hill's detachment was **real OTL force**
3. ✅ Longstreet's defensive fortification practice was **standard OTL procedure**
4. ✅ Only difference: Orders never countermanded (because Lee is dead)
5. ✅ No invention needed - exactly what Lee ordered in real life

---

## INTEGRATION STATUS

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

All relevant documents now include the historical basis for the three-month fortification period. The explanation is grounded in real OTL orders and practices, making the NTL timeline 100% historically plausible.
