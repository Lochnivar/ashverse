## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No standout film portrayal** - Forrest rarely appears in Civil War films as a major character, and when he does, it's usually brief or focuses on his OTL controversies

### Actor Archetype
**Type:** Ruthless, brilliant military leader - natural tactician with frontier edge
- **Examples:** Think of a combination of Sam Shepard's intensity and Ed Harris's military bearing. Or like a more ruthless version of Viggo Mortensen's intensity.
- **Key Qualities:** Ruthless, brilliant tactician, aggressive, loyal, competitive, carries weight of being the hunter
- **Reference Points:** The ruthless enforcer who switches sides - think of a combination of Tommy Lee Jones's gruff determination and Michael Shannon's intensity
- **NTL Note:** The key difference is the role - in OTL he's KKK leader; in NTL he's the raider hunter who hangs his own kind
