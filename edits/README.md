# Edits Folder

This folder contains suggested edits, new text, and revisions for the book files.

## Purpose

All AI-generated or AI-suggested text for the actual story goes here, NOT in the `books/` folder.

## Workflow

1. User requests edits or new text
2. AI creates suggested edits in this folder
3. User reviews the suggestions
4. User manually implements approved edits into the actual book files

## Structure

Suggested organization:
- `edits/book-01-suggested-edits-[date].md`
- `edits/book-02-suggested-edits-[date].md`
- `edits/scenes/` - for new scene suggestions
- `edits/dialogue/` - for dialogue suggestions
- `edits/descriptions/` - for description suggestions

## Important

**Nothing in this folder is part of the published story until manually copied by the user into the book files.**
