## OCTOBER 24-31, 1863 - THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH

### OCTOBER 24 - WARREN'S REPORT TO WASHINGTON

**Warren's Official Report (Telegraph, October 24, Morning):**

> TO: SECRETARY STANTON, GENERAL HALLECK
> FROM: MAJ. GEN. WARREN, COMMANDING ARMY OF POTOMAC
>
> I hereby report conclusion of offensive operations October 10-23, 1863.
>
> OPERATIONS SUMMARY:
> - October 10-12: Assault on Rappahannock line (Kelly's Ford, Rappahannock Station)
> - October 14-17: Assault on Rapidan line (Germanna Ford, Raccoon Ford)
> - October 18-23: Assault on eastern Rapidan line (Ely's Ford, Morton's Ford)
>
> RESULTS:
> - No permanent territorial gains achieved
> - Enemy defensive line remains intact
> - All seven infantry corps engaged sustained heavy casualties
>
> CASUALTIES (Estimated):
> - Union: 45,600 (killed, wounded, missing)
> - Enemy: 13,000-15,000 (estimated)
>
> CURRENT STATUS:
> - Army withdrawn to positions north of Rappahannock
> - Army combat effectiveness severely degraded
> - Morale poor across all units
> - Desertion increasing
>
> ASSESSMENT:
> Enemy defensive positions proved impregnable to frontal assault despite repeated attacks with overwhelming numerical superiority. Enemy reserve system allowed rapid response to any breakthrough attempt. Confederate fortifications, combined with natural river barriers, created defensive advantage that could not be overcome by available forces and tactics.
>
> RECOMMENDATION:
> Army requires extensive reorganization and rest before any future offensive operations possible. Recommend winter quarters and defensive posture until spring 1864.
>
> G.K. WARREN
> Major General, Commanding

### OCTOBER 24 - WASHINGTON'S REACTION

**War Department Conference (October 24, 10:00 AM):**

**Present:**
- Secretary Stanton
- General Halleck
- Assistant Secretary of War Dana
- Various staff officers

**Stanton (reading Warren's report):**
> "Forty-five thousand casualties. No gains. Enemy line intact. This is Fredericksburg times three. This is the worst military disaster since... since ever."

**Halleck:**
> "Warren did what we ordered him to do. We told him to attack. He attacked. The problem wasn't Warren's execution - it was the strategic situation. Longstreet's position is too strong."

**Stanton:**
> "I don't care about the strategic situation! The President ordered an offensive. The country needed results. Warren delivered catastrophe. He must be relieved."

**Dana:**
> "Relieving Warren won't change the fundamental problem. We're stalemated on the Rappahannock. Longstreet holds an impregnable defensive line. Any general we appoint will face the same situation."

**Stanton:**
> "Then we find a general who can solve it! Or at minimum, a general the country will trust. Warren's credibility is destroyed. We need someone else."

**Halleck:**
> "Hancock."

**Stanton:**
> "Hancock?"

**Halleck:**
> "Winfield Scott Hancock. II Corps commander. Fought brilliantly in every engagement. Wounded at Gettysburg. The men worship him. The newspapers respect him. If anyone can restore confidence, it's Hancock."

**Stanton:**
> "Will Hancock accept? After watching Warren get destroyed for doing what we ordered?"

**Halleck:**
> "Hancock's a soldier. If ordered, he'll serve. But we must be clear about expectations. No more 'attack at all costs.' No more political interference in military operations."

**Stanton:**
> "I'll discuss with the President."

### OCTOBER 24 - LINCOLN'S CABINET MEETING

**White House, Cabinet Room (October 24, 14:00):**

**Present:**
- President Lincoln
- Secretary Stanton
- Secretary Seward
- Navy Secretary Welles
- Treasury Secretary Chase
- General Halleck

**Lincoln (haggard, aged visibly):**
> "Gentlemen, you've seen the newspapers. You've read Warren's report. Forty-five thousand casualties in two weeks. The worst military disaster of the war. The Copperheads are calling for my head. The country is losing faith. What do we do?"

**Chase:**
> "We must distance ourselves from this disaster. Relieve Warren immediately. Make it clear that this was Warren's failure, not administration policy."

**Seward:**
> "That's politically convenient but factually wrong. We ORDERED Warren to attack. We forced this offensive despite his warnings about casualties. Making him the scapegoat is dishonest."

**Stanton:**
> "Dishonest or not, it's necessary. The country needs someone to blame. Better Warren than the President."

**Lincoln:**
> "Edwin, I will not throw Warren to the wolves when he was following OUR orders. Yes, he will be relieved - the army needs new leadership. But I will not publicly blame him for doing what I told him to do."

**Stanton:**
> "Then what DO we tell the country?"

**Lincoln:**
> "The truth. The enemy position was stronger than anticipated. The offensive failed. We're appointing new leadership and reassessing strategy. No more lies. No more scapegoats. The people deserve honesty."

**Chase:**
> "Honesty will destroy us politically."

**Lincoln:**
> "Perhaps. But I'd rather be destroyed by honesty than saved by lies."

**Discussion continues on next steps:**

**Halleck:**
> "I recommend Hancock for army command. He's respected, competent, and the men trust him."

**Lincoln:**
> "Will Hancock accept after what happened to Warren?"

**Halleck:**
> "I believe so. But he'll want assurances - no forced offensives, no political interference, authority to run the army as he sees fit."

**Lincoln:**
> "He'll have those assurances. What else?"

**Stanton:**
> "The army must go into winter quarters immediately. No more operations in 1863. We regroup, reorganize, rebuild for 1864."

**Lincoln:**
> "Agreed. What about Congress? They reconvene December 1st."

**Seward:**
> "The Joint Committee will demand hearings. Wade and his radicals will tear into Warren, demand accountability."

**Lincoln:**
> "Let them. Warren will testify honestly about what happened. The country will hear that we ordered an impossible attack. Maybe that will wake people up to the reality of this war."

**Welles:**
> "Or it will convince them the war is unwinnable."

**Lincoln:**
> "Perhaps it is. Perhaps Longstreet has proven that the Confederacy cannot be conquered by force. Perhaps... peace talks are inevitable."

**Shocked silence around table.**

**Seward:**
> "Mr. President, you're not seriously considering-"

**Lincoln:**
> "I'm not considering anything yet. But I'm facing reality. We can't break Longstreet's line. We've lost 70,000 men since August trying. The people are exhausted. The treasury is depleted. The army is shattered. At some point, we must ask: What are we fighting for? And is it worth the cost?"

**Another long silence.**

**Lincoln:**
> "But that's a conversation for 1864. For now: Relieve Warren. Appoint Hancock. Winter quarters. Rebuild. And pray that spring brings better options."

### OCTOBER 25-31 - THE WEEK OF CRISIS

#### OCTOBER 25 - NORTHERN NEWSPAPER REACTIONS INTENSIFY

**New York Times (October 25):**
> "ADMINISTRATION SILENT ON WARREN DISASTER"
> "President Lincoln Has Not Addressed Nation on 45,000 Casualties"
> "War Department Refuses Comment"

**New York Tribune (Horace Greeley, October 26):**
> "THE RAPPAHANNOCK DISASTER: A Reckoning"
> "This newspaper has supported the war. We have urged prosecution of the rebellion with vigor. But we cannot support suicide.
>
> Forty-five thousand casualties in two weeks. For nothing. No ground gained. No strategic advantage achieved. Nothing but mourning families and empty chairs at dinner tables across the North.
>
> General Warren attacked because Washington ordered him to attack. He obeyed orders. The fault lies not with Warren but with those who gave impossible orders and expected miracles.
>
> It is time to ask: Can this war be won? If the answer is yes, show us how. If the answer is no, then negotiate peace before another 45,000 families receive telegrams."

**Philadelphia Inquirer (October 27):**
> "PENNSYLVANIA'S SONS LOST IN VAIN"
> "State Regiments Devastated in Warren's Offensive"
> "Where is Justice for Pennsylvania?"

**Boston Globe (October 28):**
> "THE MILITARY SITUATION: An Honest Assessment"
> "Expert Opinion: Longstreet's Position Impregnable"
> "Further Offensives Would Repeat October's Disaster"

**Copperhead Newspapers Crescendo:**

**New York World (October 25):**
> "LINCOLN'S WAR OF EXTERMINATION CONTINUES"
> "45,000 More Sacrificed to Presidential Ambition"
> "HOW MANY MORE MUST DIE BEFORE PEACE?"

**Chicago Times (October 26):**
> "THE BUTCHER'S BILL COMES DUE"
> "Warren's Meat-Grinder Was Lincoln's Creation"
> "NEGOTIATE PEACE NOW"

**Detroit Free Press (October 27):**
> "MIDWEST BOYS DEAD IN VIRGINIA MUD"
> "For What? Ask Their Mothers."

**Boston:**
- 8,000 gather on Boston Common
- Mix of Copperheads and genuinely war-weary citizens
- Some Union veterans speak against continuing war

**Similar protests in Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Albany**

#### OCTOBER 29 - ARMY MORALE CRISIS

**Reports from Army of Potomac camps:**

**I Corps (Newton):**
> "Morale is the worst I've seen in 30 years of service. Men are openly questioning why we're fighting. Desertions increasing daily - 40 men deserted last night alone. Officers struggling to maintain discipline. The corps is a shell of what it was."

**II Corps (Hancock):**
> "II Corps remains steady but exhausted. Men want to know why they're being sacrificed for nothing. I've had to talk down three incipient mutinies in the past week. We need rest, reorganization, and honest answers from Washington."

**V Corps (Sykes):**
> "The men are broken. Not just tired - broken. They don't believe anymore. They don't believe we can win. They don't believe in the generals. Some don't even believe in the cause anymore. This corps cannot fight until it's rebuilt from the ground up."

**Similar reports from other corps.**

**Desertion Statistics (October 24-31):**
- I Corps: ~320 desertions
- II Corps: ~180 desertions
- III Corps: ~290 desertions
- V Corps: ~410 desertions
- VI Corps: ~270 desertions
- XI Corps: ~380 desertions
- XII Corps: ~340 desertions
- **Total:** ~2,190 desertions in one week

**Compare to pre-October average:** ~150 desertions per week

**Desertion rate increased 15x**

#### OCTOBER 30 - WARREN'S PERSONAL DEFENSE

**Warren's Letter to New York Times (Published October 31):**

> To the Editor:
>
> I have read with interest the commentary regarding the October offensive. Much has been written about "Warren's Disaster" and "Warren's Meat-Grinder." I wish to clarify the facts.
>
> On August 3rd, I was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac with explicit written orders from the President: "Prepare and execute a fall campaign to drive the enemy from Northern Virginia" and "Complete said campaign before onset of winter."
>
> These orders were not suggestions. They were not contingent on favorable circumstances. They were absolute directives from my Commander-in-Chief.
>
> Throughout September, I conducted reconnaissance and limited operations to assess enemy defenses. I reported to Washington that General Longstreet had created an extremely strong defensive position. I estimated that any major offensive would result in 15,000-25,000 casualties minimum.
>
> Secretary Stanton's response: "Casualties are acceptable if they produce forward movement."
>
> On September 30th, I again reported that enemy positions were too strong for frontal assault. I was ordered to attack regardless.
>
> On October 18th, after losing 43,000 men in eight days, I reported that the army was combat-ineffective and recommended halting operations. President Lincoln personally telegraphed: "One more effort."
>
> I made that effort. Another 12,000 casualties resulted.
>
> I do not write this to excuse my role. I commanded the army. The casualties occurred under my command. I accept that responsibility.
>
> But I will not accept the narrative that this disaster resulted from my incompetence or recklessness. I attacked because I was ordered to attack. I continued attacking because I was ordered to continue. I halted only when the army literally could not continue.
>
> If Washington had questions about the feasibility of the October offensive, they should have asked them in August - when I warned them - not in October after 45,000 men were casualties.
>
> The army did its duty. The soldiers did their duty. I did my duty. We all did what we were ordered to do. If that was not enough, perhaps the orders themselves were flawed.
>
> I await the judgment of history.
>
> Gouverneur K. Warren
> Major General, U.S. Army

**Public Reaction to Warren's Letter:**

**New York Times Editorial (October 31):**
> "General Warren's defense is devastating because it is truthful. He obeyed orders. He warned of casualties. He was overruled. The disaster was authored not in the field but in Washington."

**Harper's Weekly (November 1):**
> "Warren's letter shifts the entire conversation. This was not a military failure. This was a political failure. The administration ordered an impossible attack and Warren executed it. Who is really to blame?"

**Copperhead Papers:**
> "WARREN EXPOSES LINCOLN'S LIE!"
> "General Confirms: Washington Ordered Suicide Attack"
> "Administration Throws Warren Under Wagon After Forcing Him To Attack"

## NOVEMBER 1-30, 1863 - THE INQUIRY AND THE WAIT

### NOVEMBER 1 - CONGRESS RECONVENES

**Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War - First Session:**

**Chairman:** Senator Benjamin Wade (Radical Republican, Ohio)

**Agenda:** "Investigation into the Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign Disaster"

**Witnesses Summoned:**
- General Warren (still in command - relief delayed)
- Secretary Stanton
- General Halleck
- Corps commanders from October offensive

**Warren's Status:** Still commanding army, but under investigation. Relief order drafted but not executed.

### NOVEMBER 1-12 - THE INVESTIGATION

**November 1-10:** Warren testifies before Joint Committee (see December 3-10 section for details)

**November 12:** Joint Committee votes to recommend Warren's relief

**Stanton's Response:** Relief order already drafted (October 24), but Lincoln delays execution

**Lincoln's Reasoning:** "If we relieve him immediately, it looks like panic. We need to show 'mature consideration.'"

### NOVEMBER 13-30 - THE WAIT

**Warren remains in command** despite:
- Joint Committee recommendation (November 12)
- Relief order already drafted (October 24)
- Political pressure mounting
- Army morale collapsing

**Lincoln's Strategy:** Delay relief until January 1, 1864 to avoid appearance of panic

**Warren's Position:** Commanding an army he knows will be taken from him, but orders not yet received

**Army Status:** Warren begins winter quarters preparations, knowing he won't see them through

## JANUARY 1, 1864 - WARREN'S RELIEF ("THE MATURE CONSIDERATION FARCE")

### MORNING - THE TELEGRAM

**War Department to Warren (January 1, 08:00):**

> General Warren - You are hereby relieved of command of the Army of the Potomac effective immediately. You will turn over command to the senior corps commander present (General Hancock, II Corps) and report to Washington for reassignment.
>
> By order of the President
> Edwin M. Stanton
> Secretary of War

### NOON - CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONY

**Location:** Army of the Potomac Headquarters, Warrenton, Virginia

**Present:**
- All corps commanders
- Division commanders
- Brigade commanders
- Staff officers
- Color guard

**Warren's Final Address to Army:**

> "Soldiers of the Army of the Potomac,
>
> I have been relieved of command. General Hancock will assume leadership of this army.
>
> You have fought with courage and determination through difficult circumstances. You have done everything asked of you, and more. The losses of October were not your fault. You did your duty. Every one of you.
>
> I leave this army with pride in your service and sorrow for your losses. You deserve better than what Washington gave you in October. You deserve leadership that values your lives as much as it demands your service.
>
> General Hancock is that leader. Trust him. Follow him. He will not waste your lives.
>
> It has been my honor to serve with you.
>
> God bless you all."

**Soldiers' Reaction (Recorded):**

> "We cheered him. Not because he was a great general - he wasn't. Not because October succeeded - it didn't. We cheered him because he told the truth. He said we deserved better. And we did. That's more than any other general ever said to us."

### AFTERNOON - WARREN DEPARTS

**Warren's Final Entry in Official Diary (January 1, 1864):**

> "I leave the army in worse condition than I found it. 151 days in command (August 3 - January 1). ~70,000 casualties (including September). No strategic gains. Army shattered. Morale destroyed.
>
> But I will not apologize for October. I was given impossible orders and I executed them. If that makes me a bad general, so be it. Better a bad general who obeys orders than a good general who refuses them.
>
> The relief order was drafted October 24. The Joint Committee voted November 12. Lincoln waited nine weeks before executing it - 'mature consideration,' they call it. I call it cowardice. They knew I was finished in October but lacked the courage to act until January.
>
> I board the train for Washington at 15:00. I suspect my military career is over. Perhaps that's appropriate."

## JANUARY 1, 1864 - "THE MATURE CONSIDERATION FARCE"

### THE OFFICIAL RECORD

**Lincoln's Public Letter (January 1, 1864):**

> "After mature consideration of all relevant reports and testimonies, I have determined that Major General Warren should be relieved of command of the Army of the Potomac. This decision was reached only after careful deliberation and consultation with military advisors and congressional leadership.
>
> General Warren's distinguished service as an engineer and topographical officer is hereby acknowledged. However, the recent campaign has demonstrated that new leadership is required to restore the army's offensive spirit and effectiveness.
>
> This decision reflects not haste but careful consideration of all factors affecting the army's future operations."

**Reality (Locked Behind Closed Doors):**
- Stanton drafted relief order: October 24, 1863
- Joint Committee voted to sack Warren: November 12, 1863
- Lincoln sat on it for nine weeks so it wouldn't look like panic
- Every Northern editor knew Warren was already dead the moment the army limped north of the Occoquan

**Northern Newspaper Headlines (January 2-4, 1864):**

| Paper                  | Headline                                      | Tone |

## JANUARY 3, 1864 - HANCOCK'S APPOINTMENT

### MORNING - THE SUMMONS

**War Department to Hancock (January 2):**

> General Hancock - Report to Washington immediately for consultation with President regarding army command.
>
> HALLECK

### JANUARY 3, 10:00 - WHITE HOUSE MEETING

**Lincoln's Office:**

**Present:**
- President Lincoln
- Secretary Stanton
- General Halleck
- Major General Winfield Scott Hancock

**Lincoln (standing, shaking Hancock's hand):**
> "General Hancock, thank you for coming. I'll be direct: We're offering you command of the Army of the Potomac."

**Hancock:**
> "Mr. President, I'm honored. But I must ask: Are you offering me command so I can lead the army? Or so I can be the next scapegoat when political necessity demands another offensive?"

**Silence.**

**Lincoln:**
> "That's a fair question. The answer is: I don't know. Warren was scapegoated - let's be honest. We ordered him to attack, he attacked, it failed, and we're blaming him for it. That was wrong. I regret it.
>
> But I can't promise you won't face the same situation. Political pressure is intense. The Copperheads are surging. Congress reconvenes in December. They'll demand action. Can I promise I won't order you to attack when military wisdom says don't? No. I can't promise that."

**Hancock:**
> "Then why would I accept this command?"

**Lincoln:**
> "Because someone has to. Because that army is falling apart. Because 70,000 boys need a leader they can trust. And because you're the best man for the job."

**Hancock (long pause):**
> "What are my orders?"

**Lincoln:**
> "Winter quarters. Rebuild the army. Restore morale. No offensive operations until you judge the army ready - and I mean YOU judge, not Washington. I won't order you to attack this winter. You have my word."

**Hancock:**
> "And spring?"

**Lincoln:**
> "Spring... we'll see. A lot can change between now and April. Maybe the political situation improves. Maybe the strategic situation changes. Maybe... maybe a lot of things. But for now: Take care of that army. That's all I ask."

**Hancock:**
> "What about the Joint Committee? Wade will want my head on a platter for October."

**Stanton:**
> "We'll handle Wade. You focus on the army."

**Hancock:**
> "I accept. But I want it on record: I will not sacrifice men for political theater. If you order me to attack when I judge it unwise, I will refuse the order and resign. I'd rather be cashiered than be another Warren."

**Lincoln:**
> "Fair enough. I respect that. Take command, General. Godspeed."

### JANUARY 3, 18:00 - ANNOUNCEMENT TO PRESS

**War Department Statement:**

> "Major General Winfield Scott Hancock has been appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac, effective January 3, 1864.
>
> General Hancock, hero of Gettysburg and one of the army's most distinguished corps commanders, will lead the army through winter quarters and reorganization.
>
> The administration has full confidence in General Hancock's ability to restore the army's fighting capacity and morale."

### NORTHERN NEWSPAPER REACTIONS (JANUARY 4-5):

**New York Times:**
> "HANCOCK APPOINTED - Gettysburg Hero to Lead Army"
> "Respected Commander May Restore Confidence After October Disaster"

**Harper's Weekly:**
> "The Right Man at Last: Why Hancock May Succeed Where Others Failed"

**Philadelphia Inquirer:**
> "PENNSYLVANIA WELCOMES HANCOCK APPOINTMENT"
> "Finally, A General the Men Trust"

**Boston Globe:**
> "Hancock's Challenge: Rebuild Shattered Army Before Spring"

**Even Copperhead Papers Grudgingly Positive:**

**New York World:**
> "HANCOCK APPOINTED - But Can Any General Repair This Damage?"
> "Army Morale at Historic Low, Desertions Epidemic"

## JANUARY 3-31, 1864 - HANCOCK TAKES COMMAND

### JANUARY 3 - ARRIVAL AT ARMY

**Hancock's First Actions:**

**08:00 - Summons All Corps Commanders:**

**Present:**
- Major General John Newton (I Corps)
- Major General William H. French (III Corps, senior in II Corps vacancy)
- Major General George Sykes (V Corps)
- Major General John Sedgwick (VI Corps)
- Major General Oliver O. Howard (XI Corps)
- Major General Henry W. Slocum (XII Corps)
- Major General Alfred Pleasonton (Cavalry)

**Hancock:**
> "Gentlemen, I know what you've been through. I was there. I lost 7,600 men in my corps during October. I watched this army bleed out on Longstreet's fortifications. I know the men are exhausted, demoralized, angry.
>
> My first order: No offensive operations until further notice. We're going into winter quarters. TODAY. Every unit will march to designated winter camps and begin building shelters. No raids, no probes, no 'limited operations.' Nothing. We rest.
>
> Second: Reorganization begins immediately. We're going to rebuild this army from the ground up. New regiments to replace depleted ones. Officer promotions for those who've earned them. Discharge of those who can't hack it anymore.
>
> Third: Discipline. Desertion will stop. I'm instituting patrols, roll calls, and severe punishment for deserters. This army will NOT dissolve over winter.
>
> Fourth: Morale. I want officers talking to men. Explaining what we're doing and why. No more lies. No more false promises. Honesty.
>
> Questions?"

**Sedgwick:**
> "What about Washington? Will they let us rest?"

**Hancock:**
> "I have Lincoln's word: No offensives until I judge the army ready. If Washington interferes, I'll resign. I'm not doing what they did to Warren."

**Newton:**
> "The men don't believe anymore. How do we fix that?"

**Hancock:**
> "We show them we care. We show them their lives matter. We show them we won't waste them. It starts with winter quarters - comfortable, warm, supplied. It continues with honest leadership. Trust will return. Eventually."

### JANUARY 4-15 - MOVEMENT TO WINTER QUARTERS

**Designated Winter Camps:**

**I Corps:** Centreville area (20 miles west of Washington)
**II Corps (being reformed):** Fairfax Court House
**III Corps:** Manassas area
**V Corps:** Bristoe Station area
**VI Corps:** Gainesville area
**XI Corps:** Haymarket area
**XII Corps:** Warrenton area
**Cavalry:** Various camps screening approaches to Washington

**Total Movement:** Army withdraws 30-40 miles north of Rappahannock, establishes defensive line protecting Washington

**January 4-15: The March North:**

**Orderly withdrawal:**
- Cavalry screens rear (Longstreet does NOT pursue - Confederate army also exhausted)
- Artillery moves first
- Infantry follows in organized columns
- Wagon trains protected
- No Confederate interference

**January 15:** Entire army in designated winter camps

### JANUARY 16-31 - BUILDING WINTER QUARTERS

**Hancock's Orders for Winter Camps:**

1. **Log cabins for all:** Not tents - actual wooden structures
   - Minimum 12 men per cabin
   - Fireplace in each cabin
   - Weatherproof construction
   - Timber available from local forests

2. **Camp Layout:**
   - Organized streets and company areas
   - Sanitation facilities (latrines, bathhouses)
   - Camp hospitals for sick/wounded
   - Officers' quarters separate but not luxurious

3. **Supply:**
   - Full rations (no shortages)
   - Winter clothing issued to all
   - Firewood stockpiled
   - Medical supplies adequate

4. **Discipline:**
   - Daily roll call (prevent desertion)
   - Drill reduced (2 hours daily, not 8)
   - Religious services available
   - Mail service regular
   - Furloughs for select men (reward good behavior)

**Soldiers' Reactions (Letters home, January):**

**Private, V Corps:**
> "Ma, we're building a cabin. Real walls, real roof, real fireplace. First time I'll be warm since last March. Hancock says we're staying here all winter. No more fighting till spring. Thank God."

**Sergeant, II Corps:**
> "We're actually getting treated like human beings. Full rations. Warm quarters. Officers care whether we live or die. This is what Warren should have done in August instead of feeding us into Longstreet's guns."

**Officer, VI Corps:**
> "The men are responding to Hancock. Morale still poor but improving. Desertions down significantly. The prospect of a warm winter and no combat is like medicine. Maybe we can salvage this army."

### JANUARY DESERTION STATISTICS:

**January 1-15 (Pre-Winter Quarters):**
- Total desertions: ~1,200 (still high, but improving)

**January 16-31 (After Winter Quarters Established):**
- Total desertions: ~280 (dramatic drop)

**Hancock's Measures Working**

### JANUARY 20-31 - REORGANIZATION BEGINS

**Hancock's Reorganization Plan:**

**Phase 1 - Consolidation:**
- Merge depleted regiments
- Example: If two regiments each have 200 men (normal: 1,000), merge into one 400-man regiment
- Result: Fewer regiments, but each at better strength
- Psychological benefit: Regiments feel less decimated

**Phase 2 - New Regiments:**
- 15 new regiments arrive from recruiting depots (November-December)
- ~18,000 fresh men
- Distributed across corps to rebuild strength

## DECEMBER 1-31, 1863 - WARREN'S FINAL MONTH (THE WAIT)

### DECEMBER 1 - CONGRESS RECONVENES

**Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War - Continued Investigation:**

**Warren's Status:** Still in command, but relief order pending. Army knows he's finished but official word hasn't come.

**Political Pressure:** Mounting daily. Newspapers demanding action. Copperheads screaming for Warren's head.

**Lincoln's Position:** Delaying relief to avoid appearance of panic. "Mature consideration" requires time.

### DECEMBER 3-10 - WARREN'S TESTIMONY (MOVED FROM NOVEMBER)

**December 3 - Warren Testifies:**

**Wade:** "General Warren, you lost 45,600 men in two weeks. How do you explain this catastrophe?"

**Warren:** "I executed the orders I was given by the War Department and the President."

**Wade:** "So you blame the President?"

**Warren:** "I blame no one. I state facts. On September 30th, I reported to Secretary Stanton that General Longstreet's defensive line was too strong for frontal assault. I estimated 15,000-25,000 casualties for any major offensive. Secretary Stanton replied that casualties were acceptable if they produced forward movement. I attacked as ordered."

**Wade:** "Did you consider refusing the order?"

**Warren:** "On what grounds? A general cannot refuse orders because he judges them unwise. That's insubordination. I was ordered to attack. I attacked."

**Wade:** "And the result was 45,600 casualties."

**Warren:** "Yes."

**Wade:** "And zero gains."

**Warren:** "Correct."

**Wade:** "Do you take any responsibility for this disaster?"

**Warren:** "I commanded the army. The casualties occurred under my command. Yes, I take responsibility. But I will not accept that this disaster was caused by my incompetence. It was caused by strategic circumstances that made the offensive unwinnable from the start."

**Wade:** "Are you saying the offensive should never have been ordered?"

**Warren:** "Yes."

**Wade:** "Then why didn't you refuse?"

**Warren:** "Because the President of the United States ordered me to attack. And I am a soldier."

### DECEMBER 10 - COMMITTEE REPORT RELEASED

**Joint Committee Findings:**

> "The Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign of October 1863 represents one of the worst military disasters in American history. 45,600 Union casualties were sustained in two weeks of futile attacks on impregnable Confederate positions.
>
> **Findings:**
> 1. The offensive was ordered primarily for political, not military, reasons
> 2. General Warren warned repeatedly about likely casualties and was overruled
> 3. Secretary Stanton explicitly stated that casualties were acceptable for political benefit
> 4. The strategic situation made success nearly impossible
> 5. The offensive continued long after it was clear it would fail
>
> **Conclusions:**
> While General Warren bears tactical responsibility for the execution of the October offensive, strategic responsibility lies with the Lincoln Administration. The President and Secretary of War ordered an offensive that military professionals judged unwise, then scapegoated the general who executed their orders.
>
> **Recommendations:**
> 1. No general should be ordered to attack when he judges the military situation unfavorable
> 2. Political considerations should not override military judgment in operational decisions
> 3. The administration should be held accountable for the October disaster
>
> This Committee condemns the political manipulation of military operations and calls for reform of civilian-military relations."

**Political Earthquake:** Report splits Washington, strengthens Copperhead movement

### DECEMBER 11-31 - THE WAIT CONTINUES

**Warren's Position:** Still commanding army, but everyone knows he's finished. Relief order drafted October 24, Committee voted November 12, but Lincoln delays until January 1.

**Army Status:** Warren begins winter quarters preparations, knowing he won't complete them. Hancock waits in Washington, knowing command is coming.

**Political Situation:** Peace movement surges. Copperheads gain strength. Public support for war collapses.

**Lincoln's Dilemma:** Delay relief to avoid panic, but delay itself becomes political liability.

## DECEMBER 31, 1863 - END OF YEAR ASSESSMENT

### DECEMBER 1 - CONGRESS RECONVENES

**Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War - First Session:**

**Chairman:** Senator Benjamin Wade (Radical Republican, Ohio)

**Agenda:** "Investigation into the Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign Disaster"

**Witnesses Summoned:**
- Former General Warren
- Secretary Stanton
- General Halleck
- Corps commanders from October offensive

### DECEMBER 3-10 - WARREN'S TESTIMONY

**December 3 - Warren Testifies:**

**Wade:** "General Warren, you lost 45,000 men in two weeks. How do you explain this catastrophe?"

**Warren:** "I executed the orders I was given by the War Department and the President."

**Wade:** "So you blame the President?"

**Warren:** "I blame no one. I state facts. On September 30th, I reported to Secretary Stanton that General Longstreet's defensive line was too strong for frontal assault. I estimated 15,000-25,000 casualties for any major offensive. Secretary Stanton replied that casualties were acceptable if they produced forward movement. I attacked as ordered."

**Wade:** "Did you consider refusing the order?"

**Warren:** "On what grounds? A general cannot refuse orders because he judges them unwise. That's insubordination. I was ordered to attack. I attacked."

**Wade:** "And the result was 45,000 casualties."

**Warren:** "Yes."

**Wade:** "And zero gains."

**Warren:** "Correct."

**Wade:** "Are you saying the offensive should never have been ordered?"

**Warren:** "Yes."

**Wade:** "Then why didn't you refuse?"

**Warren:** "Because the President of the United States ordered me to attack. And I am a soldier."

**December 5 - Stanton Testifies:**

**Wade:** "Mr. Secretary, did you order General Warren to attack despite his warnings about casualties?"

**Stanton:** "The administration ordered offensive operations, yes. Political necessity demanded action."

**Wade:** "Even if military wisdom counseled against it?"

**Stanton:** "The President determined that political considerations outweighed military risks."

**Wade:** "So you admit the offensive was ordered for political, not military, reasons?"

**Stanton:** "I admit that wars are fought for political objectives, Senator. Military operations serve political ends. The President judged that showing offensive action was politically necessary. General Warren was ordered to provide that action."

**Wade:** "At any cost?"

**Stanton:** "The costs were... higher than anticipated."

**Wade:** "Forty-five thousand men higher."

**Stanton:** "Yes."

**December 8 - Halleck Testifies:**

**Wade:** "General Halleck, as General-in-Chief, did you advise against the October offensive?"

**Halleck:** "I expressed concerns about the strategic situation."

**Wade:** "Did you recommend against attacking?"

**Halleck:** "I recommended caution."

**Wade:** "That's not an answer. Did you tell the President that attacking Longstreet's fortified line would result in disaster?"

**Halleck:** "I... I expressed reservations."

**Wade:** "But you didn't say no."

**Halleck:** "The President had made his decision."

**Wade:** "So you went along."

**Halleck:** "I am a soldier, Senator. I follow orders."

**December 10 - Committee Report Released:**

**Joint Committee Findings:**

**Political Earthquake:**

**Wade's Report Splits Washington:**

**Radical Republicans:** Support Wade, condemn Lincoln for political war-making

**Moderate Republicans:** Defend Lincoln, argue war is inherently political

**Democrats/Copperheads:** Use report to attack Lincoln's entire war policy

### DECEMBER 11-20 - PUBLIC REACTION TO COMMITTEE REPORT

**Northern Newspapers:**

**New York Times:**
> "WADE REPORT CONDEMNS ADMINISTRATION"
> "Lincoln Ordered 'Political' Offensive, Caused 45,000 Casualties"

**New York Tribune (Horace Greeley):**
> "The Truth Emerges: October Was Political Theater, Not Military Necessity"
> "How Many More Will Die for Lincoln's Re-Election?"

**Harper's Weekly:**
> "The Cost of Politics: 45,000 Men Sacrificed to Show 'Offensive Action'"

**Philadelphia Inquirer:**
> "PENNSYLVANIA FAMILIES DESERVE ANSWERS"
> "Why Were Our Sons Sacrificed for Political Gain?"

**Copperhead Papers:**

**New York World:**
> "WADE REPORT PROVES IT: LINCOLN'S WAR IS ABOUT POWER, NOT UNION"
> "45,000 Dead So Lincoln Can Stay President"
> "PEACE NOW!"

**Chicago Times:**
> "THE BUTCHER EXPOSED: Lincoln Admits Political Offensive"
> "Midwest Families: Your Sons Died for Lincoln's Ambition"

**Detroit Free Press:**
> "IMPEACH LINCOLN"
> "President Ordered Suicide Attack for Political Gain"
> "This is High Crime"

### DECEMBER 12-20 - PEACE MOVEMENT SURGES

**Mass Peace Rallies Across North:**

**New York City (December 14):** 25,000 attend peace rally
- Largest anti-war demonstration of the war
- Speakers include Copperhead politicians, clergy, veterans
- Chants: "PEACE! PEACE! NO MORE WAR!"
- Calls for Lincoln's impeachment

**Philadelphia (December 15):** 18,000 rally at Independence Hall
- Pennsylvania suffered heavily in October
- Families of dead soldiers speak
- Demand peace negotiations

**Chicago (December 16):** 12,000 rally
- Midwest heartland turning against war
- Farming communities devastated by casualties

**Similar rallies in Boston, Cincinnati, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee**

**Peace Movement Messaging:**

> "The Wade Report proves Lincoln cares more about politics than lives. 45,000 men died in October for POLITICAL THEATER. How many more must die? Negotiate peace NOW. Bring our boys home. Let the South go. END THIS MADNESS."

### DECEMBER 21-31 - LINCOLN'S DILEMMA

**Lincoln's Private Thoughts (Diary entry, December 22):**

> "The Wade Report has destroyed what little public support remained for the war. The peace movement grows daily. Congress is fractured. My own party is divided. The Copperheads sense victory in 1864.
>
> I ordered the October offensive. I believed we needed to show offensive action before winter. I was wrong. Forty-five thousand casualties proved I was wrong.
>
> Warren was right. Halleck was right. The military professionals were right. The position was too strong. The offensive was unwinnable. And I ordered it anyway.
>
> I cannot undo October. I cannot bring back those 45,000 men. I cannot change what I did.
>
> But I can learn from it.
>
> No more political offensives. No more ordering generals to attack when they say it's unwise. If Hancock says the army isn't ready, I'll believe him. If the military situation doesn't support an offensive, we won't launch one.
>
> Even if that means losing the 1864 election.
>
> Even if that means the Copperheads win.
>
> Even if that means... peace negotiations.
>
> I will not sacrifice another 45,000 men to save my presidency.
>
> God help me, I won't."

**December 25 - Christmas in Winter Quarters:**

**Soldiers' Letters Home:**

**Private, V Corps:**
> "Ma, it's Christmas. We had real turkey for dinner - first time in months. Our cabin is warm. We sang carols tonight. For the first time since July, I'm not afraid I'll be dead tomorrow.
>
> They say the war might end next year. Peace talks. I hope so. I want to come home. I'm tired of fighting. We all are."

**Sergeant, II Corps:**
> "Dear Wife, Merry Christmas. I'm alive. That's the best present I could give you. 
>
> The boys are in better spirits. Hancock treats us like humans. But everyone knows the war is going badly. We lost so many in October. For nothing.
>
> There's talk the Copperheads might win next year. Part of me hopes they do. I want peace. I want to come home. I've seen enough death."

**Officer, VI Corps:**
> "To my family: Christmas in Virginia. The army is stabilizing under Hancock. But morale is fragile. The men don't believe in victory anymore. They just want to survive.
>
> I fear 1864 will bring either peace or catastrophe. I pray for the former."

### DECEMBER 31, 1863 - END OF YEAR ASSESSMENT

**Union Army of the Potomac Status:**

**Commander:** Major General Gouverneur K. Warren (still in command - relief pending)

**Strength:** ~77,400 (after October losses, minimal rebuilding - Warren's command ending)

**Morale:** Very poor (army knows Warren is finished, relief delayed)

**Combat Effectiveness:** Very low (needs months to recover)

**Political Status:** Facing electoral disaster in 1864

**Strategic Situation:** Stalemated on Rappahannock line

**Warren's Status:** Still technically in command, but relief order drafted October 24, Committee voted November 12, execution delayed until January 1, 1864 ("mature consideration")

**Confederate Army of Northern Virginia Status:**

**Strength:** ~52,400 (after October casualties + winter reinforcements)

**Morale:** Excellent (successful defense, Northern war-weariness visible)

**Combat Effectiveness:** High (veterans confident in defensive positions)

**Political Status:** Optimistic about 1864 peace negotiations

**Strategic Situation:** Holding impregnable defensive line

**Political Situation (December 31):**

**Lincoln Administration:**
- Severely weakened by Wade Report
- Party divided (Radicals vs Moderates vs War Democrats)
- Facing Copperhead surge in 1864
- No viable military strategy for 1864
- Considering peace negotiations as possibility

**Copperhead/Peace Movement:**
- Strongest position of entire war
- Unified message: End war, negotiate peace
- Popular support growing (especially Midwest)
- Positioning for 1864 electoral victory
- Likely nominee: General George B. McClellan (still popular despite 1862 failures)

**Confederate Position:**
- Defensive success has proven war cannot be won by North
- Northern war-weariness visible and growing
- Believes peace negotiations likely in 1864 if Copperheads win
- Strategy: Hold line, wait for Northern political collapse

## SUMMARY: OCTOBER-DECEMBER 1863

**The Three-Month Disaster:**

**October:**
- 14-day offensive: 45,600 Union casualties, 13,260 Confederate
- Zero permanent gains
- Warren scapegoated and relieved
- Army shattered

**November:**
- Hancock appointed (Nov 3)
- Winter quarters established
- Rebuilding begins
- Desertion crisis partially contained

**December:**
- Wade Report exposes political nature of October offensive
- Peace movement surges
- Public support for war collapses
- Lincoln facing political catastrophe
- Stage set for 1864 electoral disaster

**Casualties (August 1 - December 31, 1863):**

**Union Total:**
- August probes: ~620
- September operations: ~20,700
- October Meat-Grinder: ~45,600
- November-December: ~2,400 (desertions, disease)
- **Total:** ~69,320

**Confederate Total:**
- August probes: ~185
- September operations: ~6,100
- October Meat-Grinder: ~13,260
- November-December: ~800
- **Total:** ~20,345

**Casualty Ratio (5 months):** 3.4:1 in favor of Confederates

**Strategic Result:**
- Union offensive capability destroyed
- Confederate defensive line proven impregnable
- Northern morale collapsed
- Political situation shifted dramatically toward peace
- War stalemated with Confederates holding advantage

**Political Impact:**
- Lincoln administration weakened
- Copperhead movement surging
- Peace sentiment dominant in North
- 1864 election will likely center on war vs. peace
- If Copperheads win → peace negotiations → possible Confederate independence

**The Foundation:**

The Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign of August-December 1863 marks the turning point where Union victory becomes implausible. The combination of:
- Military disaster (70,000 casualties for no gains)
- Political disaster (Wade Report exposure)
- Morale disaster (army and public exhausted)
- Strategic disaster (no path to victory visible)

...creates conditions for:
- 1864 Copperhead electoral victory
- Peace negotiations
- Confederate independence
- AshVerse divergence

This is the fulcrum. This is where OTL and NTL permanently diverge.

## EPILOGUE: WHAT COMES NEXT

**1864 Preview:**
- Spring: No major Union offensive (Hancock refuses, Lincoln doesn't order)
- Summer: Pickett's Lightning Raid (June-July) - Confederate cavalry raid into Maryland/Pennsylvania
- Fall: Presidential election - McClellan (Copperhead) vs Lincoln
- November: McClellan wins on peace platform
- December: Peace negotiations begin

**The Long Path to Peace:**
- 1865-1866: Negotiated peace settlement
- Confederate independence achieved
- Slavery preserved (dies economically later, not militarily)
- Two Americas emerge

**Historic Assessment:**

The Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign will be remembered as:
- Worst military disaster of American Civil War
- Proof that Confederate position was unbreakable
- Political catalyst for peace movement
- End of Northern will to continue war
- Foundation of Confederate independence

**Warren will be remembered as:** The scapegoat who told the truth, relieved "after mature consideration" nine weeks after the disaster

**Hancock will be remembered as:** The general who saved the army from complete collapse

**Lincoln will be remembered as:** The president who ordered the disaster, delayed relief for political appearance, then lost the war

**Longstreet will be remembered as:** The general who held the line, won the stalemate, secured independence

**"The Mature Consideration Farce" will be remembered as:** One of the most bitterly remembered moments in the timeline - nine weeks of delay disguised as solemn deliberation
