## NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT

**The 2-Day Withdrawal Period Explained:**
> "Hancock was wounded on July 12 while actively pursuing Pickett's raiding force. With the Union commander down, Pickett used the next two days to safely withdraw his 14,000 men across the Potomac and back into Confederate territory. The raid officially ended on July 14 when the last Confederate soldier crossed the border."

**This narrative:**
- ✅ Explains the 2-day gap cleanly
- ✅ Maintains military realism
- ✅ Keeps dramatic timing (Hancock wounded during active raid)
- ✅ Provides clean closure (withdrawal period)
