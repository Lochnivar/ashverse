# The Sovereignty Parallel: 1776 and 1865

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The Native super-states (and Deseret) win sovereignty in 1865  
for the exact same reason the Thirteen Colonies won it in 1776:

A distracted, exhausted, over-stretched imperial power  
that can't spare the troops to crush the rebellion  
because it's busy bleeding itself dry somewhere else.

## The Parallel

| Year | Empire Too Busy to Enforce Control | Rebellion That Slips the Leash |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **1776** | Britain fighting France globally | Thirteen Colonies |
| **1865** | U.S. & CSA fighting each other | Sequoyah, Dakota, Comanchería, Navajo, Deseret |

## The Irony

The devil is laughing so hard he's crying.

The continent's final joke:

**The United States becomes Britain in 1776.  
And the tribes become the Americans.**

They don't win independence by being stronger.

They win it because the white nations are too busy tearing each other apart  
to notice the jail door was left open.

## The Result

1865 is 1776 in war-bonnets and buckskin.

And nobody in Washington or Richmond  
ever quite lives it down.

That's not irony.

That's poetic justice with a tomahawk.
