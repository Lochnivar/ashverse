# OTL Events That Never Happen in NTL: PoD to War End (July 2, 1863 - February 20, 1865)

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS - IDENTIFYING OTL ASSUMPTIONS  
**Purpose:** Identify OTL events from PoD to war end that don't happen in NTL, and flag incorrect assumptions

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**PoD:** July 1, 1863, ~10:30 p.m. (Lee dies)  
**NTL War End:** February 20, 1865 (Grant surrenders at Appomattox)  
**OTL War End:** April 9, 1865 (Lee surrenders at Appomattox)

**Key Finding:** Many major OTL events from July 1863 to April 1865 **never happen in NTL** because:
1. Lee dies, Longstreet withdraws → Gettysburg ends after Day 1
2. Vicksburg likely still falls (but impact different without Gettysburg victory)
3. No Overland Campaign (Grant never promoted to general-in-chief)
4. No Siege of Petersburg (war ends before it can begin)
5. No Atlanta Campaign (Sherman's path different)
6. No Sherman's March to the Sea (war ends before it happens)
7. Lincoln loses 1864 election (McClellan wins on peace platform)

**Critical Assumptions to Check:**
- Are we assuming OTL Western Theater events still happen?
- Are we assuming OTL political events still happen?
- Are we assuming OTL military promotions still happen?
- Are we assuming OTL economic events still happen?

## PART 1: JULY 1863 - THE IMMEDIATE DIVERGENCE

### OTL Events (July 2-4, 1863)

| Date | OTL Event | What Actually Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **July 2, 1863** | **Pickett's Charge (Day 2 of Gettysburg)** | Lee orders Longstreet to attack Union left flank. Longstreet protests but obeys. Union holds. | **NTL:** Never happens - Longstreet withdraws at dawn |
| **July 3, 1863** | **Pickett's Charge (Day 3 of Gettysburg)** | Lee orders frontal assault on Cemetery Ridge. ~12,500 Confederate casualties. ANV shattered. | **NTL:** Never happens - army already withdrawn |
| **July 4, 1863** | **Vicksburg Surrenders** | Pemberton surrenders to Grant. Mississippi River opens. Twin victory with Gettysburg. | **NTL:** Likely still happens, but **impact different** - no "twin victory" morale boost |

### NTL Reality (July 2-4, 1863)

| Date | NTL Event | What Actually Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **July 2, 1863** | **Longstreet Withdraws** | ANV withdraws at dawn, intact. Meade freezes for 36 hours. | **Impact:** ANV preserved, Northern morale doesn't get boost |
| **July 3, 1863** | **Meade Begins Pursuit** | Meade finally pursues, but Longstreet has 36-hour head start | **Impact:** No decisive victory, war continues |
| **July 4, 1863** | **Vicksburg Surrenders** | Pemberton surrenders to Grant (likely still happens) | **Impact:** No "twin victory" - Vicksburg alone doesn't boost morale enough |

### Critical Assumptions to Check

1. **Vicksburg:** Do we assume it still falls? **Likely YES** - Grant's siege was independent of Gettysburg
2. **Vicksburg Impact:** Do we assume it has same morale boost? **NO** - Without Gettysburg, it's just one victory, not "twin victory"
3. **New York Draft Riots:** Do we assume they still happen? **UNKNOWN** - Need to check if they're tied to Gettysburg morale

## PART 2: LATE 1863 - WESTERN THEATER DIVERGENCE

### OTL Events (September-November 1863)

| Date | OTL Event | What Actually Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **September 19-20, 1863** | **Battle of Chickamauga** | Bragg defeats Rosecrans. Union retreats to Chattanooga. | **NTL:** **LIKELY STILL HAPPENS** - Independent of Gettysburg |
| **October 16, 1863** | **Grant Promoted to Command of Military Division of the Mississippi** | Grant takes command of all Western armies. | **NTL:** **LIKELY STILL HAPPENS** - Based on Vicksburg success |
| **November 23-25, 1863** | **Battle of Chattanooga** | Grant breaks Bragg's siege. Union victory. | **NTL:** **LIKELY STILL HAPPENS** - Grant's Western success continues |

### NTL Reality (September-November 1863)

| Date | NTL Event | What Actually Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **July-October 1863** | **Longstreet's Pennsylvania-Maryland Raid** | ANV raids Pennsylvania/Maryland for 10 weeks. Burns railroads, levies $3-5 million. | **Impact:** Northern morale collapses, not boosted |
| **Late October 1863** | **Battle of Hagerstown** | Meade finally corners Longstreet, repulsed. ~9k Union casualties. | **Impact:** Last hope of decisive victory dies |
| **November 1863** | **Meade Sacked** | Lincoln sacks Meade after Hagerstown failure. | **Impact:** Command chaos, Northern confidence shattered |

### Critical Assumptions to Check

1. **Chickamauga:** Do we assume it still happens? **LIKELY YES** - Independent of Eastern Theater
2. **Chattanooga:** Do we assume it still happens? **LIKELY YES** - Grant's Western success continues
3. **Grant's Promotion:** Do we assume he still gets Western command? **LIKELY YES** - Based on Vicksburg
4. **Grant's Path to General-in-Chief:** Do we assume he still gets promoted? **NO** - This is the key divergence

## PART 6: CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS TO VERIFY

### High-Risk Assumptions (Need Immediate Verification)

1. **Western Theater Continuity:**
   - **Assumption:** Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Atlanta Campaign still happen
   - **Risk:** Medium - These events may be affected by Eastern Theater morale
   - **Action:** Need to analyze if Western Theater events are truly independent

2. **New York Draft Riots:**
   - **Assumption:** Still happen in July 1863
   - **Risk:** Medium - May be tied to Gettysburg morale boost (or lack thereof)
   - **Action:** Need to check if riots are tied to specific events or general war weariness

3. **Atlanta Campaign:**
   - **Assumption:** Still happens, but path/outcome may differ
   - **Risk:** Medium - Sherman's campaign may be affected by Eastern Theater events
   - **Action:** Need to analyze Sherman's path and timeline

### Low-Risk Assumptions (Likely Correct)

1. **Vicksburg Surrender:** Still happens (independent of Gettysburg)
2. **Grant's Western Promotion:** Still happens (based on Vicksburg)
3. **Chickamauga/Chattanooga:** Still happen (Western Theater independent)

### Explicitly Different (No Assumption Risk)

1. **Gettysburg Days 2-3:** Never happen (Longstreet withdraws)
2. **Overland Campaign:** Never happens (Grant never promoted)
3. **Siege of Petersburg:** Never happens (war ends before it can begin)
4. **Lincoln's Re-election:** Never happens (McClellan wins)
5. **Sherman's March to the Sea:** Never happens (war ends before it can happen)
6. **13th Amendment:** Never passes (no Union victory)

---

## PART 7: RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Verify Western Theater Events:**
   - Analyze if Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Atlanta Campaign are truly independent
   - Check if Eastern Theater morale affects Western Theater operations
   - Determine if Sherman's path changes without Eastern victories

2. **Verify New York Draft Riots:**
   - Check if riots are tied to Gettysburg morale or general war weariness
   - Determine if riots still happen without Gettysburg victory
   - Analyze if riots are affected by Longstreet's Pennsylvania raid

3. **Verify Economic/Political Events:**
   - Check if economic events (inflation, shortages) are tied to specific military events
   - Determine if political events (elections, amendments) are affected by war progress
   - Analyze if social events (draft resistance, riots) are tied to morale

### Documentation Updates Needed

1. **Create Western Theater Timeline:**
   - Document which OTL Western events still happen in NTL
   - Document which OTL Western events don't happen in NTL
   - Document how Western Theater differs from OTL

2. **Create Political Timeline:**
   - Document which OTL political events still happen in NTL
   - Document which OTL political events don't happen in NTL
   - Document how political landscape differs from OTL

3. **Create Economic Timeline:**
   - Document which OTL economic events still happen in NTL
   - Document which OTL economic events don't happen in NTL
   - Document how economic conditions differ from OTL

## CONCLUSION

**Key Findings:**

1. **Major OTL events that DON'T happen in NTL:**
   - Gettysburg Days 2-3 (Pickett's Charge)
   - Overland Campaign (Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor)
   - Siege of Petersburg
   - Fall of Richmond
   - Sherman's March to the Sea
   - Lincoln's Re-election
   - 13th Amendment

2. **Major OTL events that LIKELY STILL HAPPEN in NTL:**

**Next Steps:**

1. Verify Western Theater events (Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Atlanta)
2. Verify New York Draft Riots
3. Create comprehensive Western Theater timeline
4. Create comprehensive political timeline
5. Create comprehensive economic timeline

**Status:** Analysis complete. Ready for verification and documentation updates.
