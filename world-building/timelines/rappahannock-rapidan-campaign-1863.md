## LOCKED ASSUMPTIONS

- **Meade sacked August 1, 1863** for "want of aggression" after failing to trap Longstreet
- **Warren appointed August 3, 1863** - young (33), aggressive, politically clean (engineer, topographical corps veteran)
- **Union Army of the Potomac:** ~110,000 men after reorganization, but exhausted, mutinous, full of green bounty men
- **Confederate Army of Northern Virginia:** ~55,000 men under Longstreet, dug in on Rappahannock-Rapidan line, rested and resupplied from Pennsylvania raids
- **Political Pressure:** Lincoln/Stanton demand a fall offensive "to erase the stigma of 1863" - Warren has no choice but to attack
- **Outcome:** Disastrous "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder" (October 10-23, 1863) - three separate killing grounds, ~22,000 Union losses
- **Warren relieved January 1, 1864** after the disaster; Hancock takes command January 3, 1864

## COMPLETE CHRONOLOGICAL TIMELINE

### AUGUST 1863: MEADE SACKED, WARREN APPOINTED

**August 1, 1863**

- **Washington:** Lincoln summons Meade, Halleck, Stanton, and the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War to the White House.
- **Outcome:** Meade scapegoated for the 36-hour freeze and failure to trap Longstreet. Relieved "for want of aggression."
- **Meade's Reaction:** Bitter resignation. Private letter to wife: "They needed a scapegoat, and I was the one who let him get away."

**August 3, 1863**

- **Washington:** Gouverneur K. Warren appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac.
- **Written Orders from Lincoln:** "Restore the offensive spirit of the army or we lose the war this winter."
- **Warren's Profile:** 33 years old, aggressive engineer, topographical corps veteran, politically clean (no Copperhead ties).
- **Initial Actions:** Warren arrives at army HQ near Warrenton, VA. Begins immediate reorganization: purges "Meade conservatives," promotes aggressive officers, brings up new regiments from Washington defenses.

**August 4–15, 1863**

- **Union:** Frantic rebuilding. Army swells to ~110,000 with fresh troops, but quality mixed (many bounty men, short-term enlistees). Warren drills relentlessly, focusing on rapid maneuvers and offensive spirit.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet fortifies every ford and ridge from Fredericksburg to Gordonsville. Army rests, refits from Pennsylvania spoils.

**August 16–31, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren probes Longstreet's lines with cavalry raids (Hampton/Fitzhugh Lee repulse them). Warren's scouts report: "The Rebs are dug in like ticks." Warren delays major action, citing need for more artillery.
- **Washington:** Stanton wires Warren: "The President expects results before the leaves fall."
- **Confederate:** Longstreet launches small counter-raids to keep Union off-balance.

---

### SEPTEMBER 1863: THE PROBING PHASE

**September 1–15, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren conducts limited offensives across the Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford and Culpeper Court House. Minor gains, but Longstreet's defenses hold. Union losses: ~3,000.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet cedes outer positions but bleeds Warren at every river crossing.

**September 16–30, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren pushes to the Rapidan line. Probes at Raccoon Ford and Somerville Ford. Longstreet's fortifications prove impregnable. Union losses mount to ~5,000 in skirmishes.
- **Washington:** Lincoln to Stanton: "Warren must attack before winter. The country demands it."

---

### OCTOBER 1863: THE "FOURTEEN DAYS' MEAT-GRINDER"

**October 10, 1863 – Campaign Begins**

- **Union:** Warren launches full offensive in three columns:
  - Left: I/II Corps cross Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford
  - Center: V/VI Corps at Culpeper
  - Right: III/XI Corps at Germanna Ford
- **Confederate:** Longstreet anticipates; has pre-dug positions at every crossing.

**October 10–13: The Rappahannock Killing Ground**

- **Union:** Left column smashed at Kelly's Ford (Marye's Heights-style defense). ~6,000 casualties.
- **Confederate:** Ewell's corps holds with minimal loss (~1,200).

**October 14–17: The Rapidan Killing Ground**

- **Union:** Center column bled out at Culpeper (North Anna-style entrenchments). ~7,000 casualties.
- **Confederate:** Hill's corps repulses attacks (~1,500 loss).

**October 18–23: The Occoquan Killing Ground**

- **Union:** Right column shattered at Germanna Ford (combined artillery/crossfire slaughter). ~9,000 casualties.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet's reserve crushes final push (~2,000 loss).

**Total Union Losses:** ~22,000 in 14 days (the "Meat-Grinder")  
**Confederate Losses:** ~4,700

**Outcome:** Warren's army staggers back north a "bloody stump." Northern newspapers coin "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder." Morale collapses.

**October 24–31, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren digs in north of the Occoquan. Mutinies in three regiments. Desertions skyrocket.
- **Washington:** Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War begins investigation. Stanton to Lincoln: "The army is broken."

---

### NOVEMBER 1863: AFTERMATH AND INQUIRY

**November 1–30, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren digs in north of the Occoquan. Mutinies continue. Desertions reach epidemic levels. Congressional inquiry begins.
- **Washington:** Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War investigates the disaster. Warren's command under scrutiny.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet fortifies winter lines. Army rests, morale high.

---

### DECEMBER 1863: THE WINTER OF DESPAIR

**December 1–31, 1863**

- **Union:** Morale collapses. Desertions reach epidemic levels. Copperhead papers declare "the war is lost." Midterm elections swing heavily anti-war. Peace talks whispers begin.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet launches small winter raids to keep pressure on. Army winters fat in Culpeper/Orange Counties.
- **Washington:** Lincoln to Stanton: "We have lost the year. God help us in 1864."

---

### JANUARY 1864: THE SACKING

**January 1, 1864**

- **Washington:** Lincoln issues a 1,400-word public letter "after mature consideration of all relevant reports and testimonies" relieving Warren "with regret" and praising his "distinguished service as an engineer and topographical officer."
- **Official Order:** "Relieved for want of results and loss of offensive spirit."
- **Reality (locked behind closed doors):**
  - Stanton had the relief order drafted on October 24
  - The Joint Committee voted to sack Warren on November 12
  - Lincoln sat on it for nine weeks so it wouldn't look like panic
  - Every Northern editor knew Warren was already dead the moment the army limped north of the Occoquan

**January 2, 1864**

- **Washington:** Lincoln's letter released to the press. Northern newspapers respond with scathing headlines (see "The Mature Consideration Farce" below).

**January 3, 1864**

- **Washington:** Winfield Scott Hancock appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac (after brief consideration of John Reynolds - but he's dead at Gettysburg).
- **Hancock's Orders:** "Rebuild the army's morale and effectiveness. The war depends on it."
- **Union:** Hancock begins reorganization. Army remains in winter quarters north of the Occoquan.

**Status:** Canon-Locked

**Next:** Hancock's command (January 1864) → Pickett's Lightning Raid (June-July 1864)

### Northern Newspaper Headlines (January 2-4, 1864)

| Paper                  | Headline                                      | Tone |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------|
| New York Herald        | "WARREN RELIEVED AFTER MATURE CONSIDERATION" | Dripping sarcasm |
| Chicago Tribune        | "Nine Weeks to Discover What Every Soldier Knew in October" | Fury |
| New York World (Copperhead) | "Lincoln Finally Admits His War Is Lost"      | Gloating |

### Fairfax-Lockwood's Footnote (1985)

> "President Lincoln's letter of 1 January 1864 relieving General Warren is a masterpiece of bureaucratic procrastination. One is almost tempted to admire the artistry with which nine weeks of political necessity were disguised as solemn deliberation. Almost."

**Locked.**  
The farce is now canon.  
And still not apologising.
