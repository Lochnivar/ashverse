# California Presidents: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** California Republic presidential timeline plausibility (1873-1939)

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** California presidential timeline (1873-1939) is historically plausible

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Each president is plausible (age, background, fit)
- All are real historical Californians
- Age concerns resolved (revised list)
- First woman president is plausible

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Timeline: 1873-1939 (11 presidents)
- Party: Pacific Republican Party (dominant party)
- Factions: Globalists vs Nationalists
- Electoral system: Six-Count Act
- Age requirements: Must be plausible age for presidency

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Many figures existed, some died earlier/later
- NTL: Some require longer/shorter lives than OTL
- All candidates: Real historical Californians

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain chronological order
- All presidents must be real people
- Ages must be plausible
- First woman president must be justified

## RESULTS

**Overall Timeline Plausibility: 88%** (Very Strong)

### Individual President Results:

| C. C. Young | 1927-1933 | 87% | ✅ LOCKED | Real person, age 56-62 |
| Culbert L. Olson | 1933-1939 | 88% | ✅ LOCKED | Real person, age 57-63 |

**Breakdown:**
- Average Plausibility: 87%
- Lowest Score: 85% (Chester H. Rowell)
- Highest Score: 90% (Leland Stanford)
- All presidents meet 70% gate: ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **All Real People:** Every president is a real historical Californian
- ✅ **Age Appropriate:** All ages are plausible (revised list fixes concerns)
- ✅ **First Woman President:** Florence Collins Porter (1909-1915) - justified and plausible
- ✅ **Character Fit:** Each fits faction/narrative role
- ✅ **Narrative Coherence:** Timeline serves story function

**First Woman President Analysis:**
- Florence Collins Porter: Age 56 in 1909, US-born, newspaper owner/editor
- "We don't care about morality, we don't care about testosterone, we just care if she can do the job"
- Radio pioneer, political organizer
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Realistic for California's pragmatic philosophy

## CAVEATS

**Overall:**
- Some presidents require longer lives than OTL
- First woman president requires cultural acceptance
- Some ages are older/younger than ideal but plausible

**Individual:**
- Fair: Needs to live to 1891 (OTL died 1894) - **Justification:** Easy extension
- Porter: First woman president - **Justification:** California's pragmatic philosophy
- Others: Minor lifespan adjustments where needed

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Strong historical precedents, all real people, age concerns resolved. First woman president justified by California's pragmatic philosophy. All presidents meet 70% plausibility gate.
