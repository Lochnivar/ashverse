# Hold-Out States: Slavery Legal Until 1905

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

There are no true state hold-outs after 1905.

Mississippi tried to be the last rebel  
and got publicly spanked by its own Supreme Court  
for the crime of making the rest of the country look bad.

1894 = the last slave child is born.

1905 = the last legal fiction is finally buried.

Mississippi's Perpetual Slavery Act is the dying scream of the fire-eaters  
and the birth certificate of Confederate Jim Crow.

## The Answer

The entire Confederacy is the hold-out until 1905, with one spectacular exception that gets slapped down hard.

## The Timeline

| Year | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **1867–1894** | Slavery is legal nationwide under the Toombs Act (national constitutional amendment). |
| **1892** | Mississippi, in a final act of fire-eater defiance, passes the **Perpetual Slavery Act**, declaring slavery permanent and irrevocable in Mississippi, even against future Confederate amendments. |
| **1894** | Slavery becomes functionally dead (no new imports, no new slave births, raids + boycott have killed it). **"The Last Chain Falls"** – the emotional, moral, and practical end. |
| **1894** | Mississippi Supreme Court "clarifies" the Act in the most humiliating way possible: **"The Perpetual Slavery Act shall apply only as punishment for crime…"** (Instantly turns Mississippi slavery into convict leasing while keeping the original law technically on the books.) |
| **1905** | National convention repeals the Toombs amendment → slavery is legally abolished everywhere. The Mississippi Act dies with it (the clarification already gutted it). |

## Mississippi's Perpetual Slavery Act (1892)

### The Act
Mississippi, in a final act of fire-eater defiance, passes the **Perpetual Slavery Act**, declaring slavery permanent and irrevocable in Mississippi, even against future Confederate amendments.

### The Supreme Court Clarification (1894)
Mississippi Supreme Court "clarifies" the Act in the most humiliating way possible:

**"The Perpetual Slavery Act shall apply only as punishment for crime…"**

This instantly turns Mississippi slavery into convict leasing while keeping the original law technically on the books.

### The Result
Mississippi tried to be the last rebel  
and got publicly spanked by its own Supreme Court  
for the crime of making the rest of the country look bad.
