# REFINED HARRISBURG OCCUPATION TIMELINE (JULY 3-10, 1863)

**Status:** Canon - Ready for Integration  
**Plausibility Assessment:** 92-94% (High Confidence)  
**Key Innovation:** Gradual west→east shift with Quaker gun deception enabled by July 5 battle

---

## OVERVIEW

### Strategic Framework:

**Longstreet's Dual Priorities:**
1. **Security First (July 3-5):** Hold dominant terrain while army rests and he decides next move
2. **Mobility Second (July 6-10):** Shift to east bank for offensive flexibility once Reading chosen

**The Evolution:**
- July 3-4: West-bank heavy (security, no decision yet on next objective)
- July 5: Battle proves heights unassailable, Longstreet decides on Reading (needs east bank)
- July 6-9: Gradual shift east under cover of Quaker gun deception
- July 10: Departure from east bank directly toward Reading

**Why This Works:**
- Longstreet holds heights initially (in character, professional)
- Shifts when he has strategic clarity (Reading chosen, needs mobility)
- Meade tries aggression (July 5 battle), gets bloodied, becomes cautious
- Quaker guns exploit Meade's caution (won't test after 4,600 casualties)
- Both generals look competent throughout

## JULY 3, 1863 - ARRIVAL & SURRENDER

### 05:00-12:00: Approach and Reconnaissance

**Confederate Lead Elements Arrive West Bank:**

**Rodes' Division (~7,400 men):**
- First to reach west bank (Susquehanna) opposite Harrisburg
- Daniel's Brigade scouts fords, assesses city defenses
- Artillery positions selected on Camp Hill heights (400-450 ft elevation)
- Reconnaissance confirms: Militia only (~3,000-4,000), no regulars

**Early's Division (~5,500 men):**
- Arrives 30 minutes behind Rodes
- Deploys south of Rodes on west bank
- Prepares crossing sites at multiple fords

**Initial Deployment (Noon July 3):**
- **West Bank:** ~13,000 men (Rodes, Early), artillery positioning on heights
- **East Bank:** City still in Union/militia hands
- **Approach:** Third Corps closing from south, First Corps from west

---

### 12:00-14:00: Formal Summons and Surrender

**12:15 - Summons Delivered:**

Longstreet's terms (via courier under white flag to Mayor Kepner):
- Surrender city, public property, military stores
- Private property respected, citizens unmolested
- Food/supplies paid for (Confederate scrip or US currency)
- Militia paroled
- **Time limit:** 2:00 PM (14:00)

**13:30 - Harrisburg's Decision:**

Mayor's Council votes:
- **For surrender:** 7 members
- **For resistance:** 1 member
- **Reasoning:** 70,000 veterans vs. 4,000 militia = massacre

**14:00 - Surrender Agreement:**

Mayor Kepner meets Longstreet at west bank ford:
> "We surrender under protest and duress. We ask General Longstreet to honor his terms and remember that civilians are not his enemies."

Longstreet's response:
> "Mr. Mayor, you have made the wise decision. Your city will be occupied peacefully. My orders are clear: No looting, no violence, no unnecessary destruction. Any soldier who violates these orders will answer to me personally."

**Result:** Harrisburg surrenders without shot fired

---

### 14:00-18:00: Initial Occupation (Balanced Deployment Begins)

**14:15-15:00: First Crossing**

**Early's Division - First Across:**
- **Hays' Brigade (Louisiana Tigers):** Leads (1,500 men), wades across West Fairview ford
- First Confederate troops in Northern state capital
- Enters city, civilians watch in silence
- Secures state capitol building

**15:00-16:30: Occupation Forces Cross**

- State offices occupied

**State Arsenal** (Hays' Brigade):
- Immediate inventory begins
- Guards posted (no looting tolerated)
- **Captured:** 18,000-20,000 rifles, 2M+ rounds ammunition, 40+ guns

**State Treasury** (Daniel's Brigade, crossing now):
- Treasury building secured
- **Seized:** $500,000 specie (gold/silver)
- Guards with officer supervision

**Railroad Facilities** (Iverson's Brigade, crossing):
- Pennsylvania Railroad depot secured
- Northern Central Railroad junction
- Cumberland Valley Railroad terminus

---

### 18:00-Evening: Main Army Disposition

**West Bank (Camp Hill Heights - MAIN FORCE):**

**Deployed on Heights (~50,000 men by evening):**
- **First Corps:** Hood, McLaws (~13,500) - Camp Hill proper
- **Third Corps:** Anderson, Pender, Heth (~22,000) - Extended line south
- **Pickett's Division:** (~5,500) - Reserve, 2 miles west
- **Second Corps (Partial):** Rodes' remaining brigades (~5,000)

**Artillery:** ALL major batteries emplaced on heights
- Commanding view of river, city, approaches
- ~120 guns positioned
- Crews begin digging artillery pits

**Fortification Begins:**
- Engineers mark trench lines
- Infantry begins digging (continues overnight)
- Abatis prepared from local timber

**Longstreet's Assessment (evening, on Camp Hill):**
> "These heights command everything. Artillery can range any ford, any approach to the city. If Meade attacks, we destroy him from here. But I don't know where we're going NEXT - Philadelphia? Baltimore? Reading? Virginia? Until I decide, we hold the strongest position available. The heights buy us time."

---

**East Bank (Harrisburg City - OCCUPATION FORCE ~12,000 men):**

**In City Proper:**
- **Early's Division:** ~5,500 (garrison, patrol duty)
- **Rodes' Division (Partial):** Daniel's, Doles' brigades (~3,100)
- **Others:** Artillery support, engineers, quartermaster (~3,400)

**Purpose:**
- Political occupation (Confederate flag over Capitol)
- Process requisitions, maintain order
- Access to city resources (arsenal, treasury, supplies)

**Provost Marshal Established:**
- Colonel appointed from Rodes' staff
- Guards rotate from brigades
- **Orders:** No looting (violators shot), maintain discipline

---

### 18:30: Longstreet Establishes Headquarters

**Location:** Governor's Office, Pennsylvania State Capitol (east bank)

**Crosses with Staff:**
- Longstreet rides across pontoon bridge (just completed)
- Escort: Cavalry squadron, staff officers
- Route: West Fairview → Market Street → Capitol Square

**Reception:** Civilians watch from windows, doorways. Silent. No violence, no cheering.

**First Orders Issued (18:30-20:00):**

1. **Provost Marshal:** Discipline policy, no looting (death penalty)
2. **Engineers:** Complete pontoon bridges (3 total), fortify heights
3. **Quartermaster:** Begin foraging operations (organized parties, receipts issued)
4. **Medical:** Establish hospitals (Gettysburg wounded need continuing care)
5. **All Commanders:** Rest and refit operations begin immediately

---

### Evening July 3, 1863 – Governor's Office, Pennsylvania State Capitol (Staff Briefing and Private Exchange)

**20:00-21:00: Staff Briefing**
- Longstreet reviews occupation status with corps commanders
- Confirms: Rest, refit, security priorities for next 24-48 hours
- No strategic decision yet on next objective
- Briefing concludes, most officers depart

**21:00: Private Exchange - Early, Sorrel, and Longstreet**

After the staff briefing, the room empties. Major General Jubal Early lingers.

Early proposes a full-dress spectacle for the morrow: bands playing captured Union tunes in mockery, citizens ordered to line the streets.

Colonel G. Moxley Sorrel objects quietly:

> "General Early, half our camps and every newspaper in Richmond call this fight a second 1776. My own great-grandfather stood with Richard Henry Lee against a king who taxed without consent. If we are truly in their place now, then let us act it. March the men in pride if you wish, but spare the mockery and the forced crowds. We cheapen our own cause if we turn their sacred day into a farce."

Longstreet raises a hand before Early can retort.

> "Colonel Sorrel is right. The men have earned the right to march with pride through these streets tomorrow — that alone will sting more than any mockery ever could. We will form columns, play our own music, and pass in review. No captured tunes, no orders compelling attendance."

The others depart. Early remains a moment longer.

Longstreet speaks privately:

> "Jubal, I know this rubs you wrong. These people are beaten for now — sullen is enough. Push harder tomorrow with mockery and crowds and you risk turning sullen into desperate. We can't spare the men to suppress a riot when the army still needs rest."

He gestures to the map — no finger yet tracing a specific route east.

> "Right now my only decision is to give these men another full day — maybe two — of hot food, dry boots, and sleep. After that we'll choose where to strike next. Wherever it is, there'll be economic arteries to cut and infrastructure to burn. That's where I'll need your aggression and your flair — turned on targets that bleed the North's war effort, not on civilians who can only bleed us with pinpricks. Hold that fire. You'll get your chance soon enough."

Early exhales, tension easing slightly.

> "I'll hold it, sir. But don't keep me on too tight a leash when the time comes."

Longstreet (dryly): "I won't. Good night, General."

---

### Evening Assessment:

**Confederate Position:**
- ✅ Harrisburg occupied (political objective achieved)
- ✅ Heights secured (military objective achieved)
- ✅ Army split but mutually supporting (bridges connect)
- ✅ Arsenal, treasury seized ($500K + weapons for two corps)
- ✅ Foraging begins (Pennsylvania wealth accessible)

**Union Reaction (Meade, 35 miles south):**
- Receives news: "Harrisburg has surrendered"
- Orders: Continue march north (arrives July 4-5)
- Assessment: "They're fortified on heights. This will be difficult."

### Evening July 3, 1863 – Meade's Headquarters (Telegram Barrage)

As confirmation arrives that Lee is dead and Longstreet commands, the telegrams from Washington begin in a torrent.

**Stanton:** "The occupation of a Northern capital is intolerable. Immediate measures required."  
**Halleck:** "Demonstrate aggression at once or the enemy will believe us paralyzed."  
**Lincoln himself wires directly:** "The people cannot endure this. What is your plan, and when will you act?"

Meade reads them in the lamplight, face grim. He mutters to an aide:  
"If we sit idle another day, I half-expect the President to ride into camp and take command himself."

---

## JULY 4, 1863 - INDEPENDENCE DAY HUMILIATION

### Dawn-10:00: Consolidation and Parade Preparation

**West Bank Activities:**
- Fortification continues (trenches 50% complete)
- Third Corps arrives, deploys on heights
- Artillery emplaced, ranging shots tested
- Soldiers rest, first hot meals in days

**East Bank Activities:**
- Parade preparation (Early's Division)
- City occupation solidifies
- Foraging parties dispatched (Cumberland Valley, Dauphin County)

**Pontoon Bridges Complete (3 operational):**
1. West Fairview crossing (1,000+ ft)
2. City front crossing (downtown)
3. Southern crossing (backup)

**Traffic:** Busy both directions (supplies, troops rotating, foraging parties)

---

### 10:00-12:00: The March Through Harrisburg

**Confederate Units:**  
- Early's full division (~5,500 men)  
- Daniel's and Doles' brigades of Rodes' division (~3,100 men)  
- Selected batteries for escort

**Route:**  
- Form up in columns at Capitol Square  
- March down Market Street to Front Street, along the riverfront, then return via Second Street to the Capitol  
- Longstreet reviews the columns from the Capitol steps, mounted, silent

**Bands:**  
- Play "Dixie," "The Bonnie Blue Flag," and "Maryland, My Maryland" only

**Civilian Presence:**  
- No orders issued to compel attendance  
- Residents watch from doorways, windows, and sidewalks — several thousand line the route spontaneously or inescapably  
- The crowds are almost entirely silent; here and there a woman weeps openly

**Tone:**  
- Troops march with evident pride and discipline  
- No jeering, no theatrical gestures  
- The dignity of the columns becomes the weapon: a rested, confident Confederate army occupying a Northern capital on the Union's most sacred civic holiday  
- Longstreet salutes each brigade as it passes, says nothing, then returns across the river to the heights

**Effect:**  
- Confederate morale lifted  
- Civilian humiliation profound and lasting — remembered as colder and more crushing than any amount of shouting or mockery could have been

---

### Afternoon: Meade Arrives South Bank

**12:00-15:00: Union Army Approaches**

**Lead Elements (VI Corps, Sedgwick):**
- Reach south bank Susquehanna (5-8 miles south of Harrisburg)
- Observe Confederate positions on Camp Hill heights
- Report to Meade: "Fortified. Artillery commanding everything."

**Meade Arrives (15:00):**
- Conducts personal reconnaissance
- Observes heights through binoculars
- Sees: Trenches, artillery, Confederate flags
- Assessment: "This is Fredericksburg. Marye's Heights again."

**15:00-18:00: Light Probing**

**Union Cavalry:**
- Tests fords 10 miles south of Harrisburg
- Encounters Confederate cavalry screens (Hampton's Brigade)
- Brief skirmishes, withdraws

**Confederate Response:**
- Cavalry reports to Longstreet: "Union probing south. Main body arriving."
- Infantry maintains positions (no panic)
- Artillery crews stand ready

**Casualties (July 4):**
- Confederate: ~100 (cavalry skirmishers)
- Union: ~200 (cavalry, some infantry pickets)

---

### Evening: Both Generals Assess

**Longstreet (Governor's Office, 20:00):**

Staff meeting with corps commanders:

> "Meade is here. South bank, maybe 8 miles out. He's been probing our cavalry screens. Question is: Will he attack? And if so, where?"

**Hood:** "Those heights are unassailable, sir. If he attacks, we slaughter him."

**Longstreet:** "Maybe. But Meade's not Burnside. He's cautious. He might not attack at all. Or he might try something clever - flank around, cross north or south of us. We watch and wait."

**Orders:** Maintain vigilance, continue fortifying, let Meade make first move

---

**Meade (HQ, South Bank, 20:00):**

Council with corps commanders:

> "Gentlemen, I've seen those heights. Longstreet has 70,000 men up there, fortified, with artillery commanding every approach. If we attack frontally, it's Fredericksburg. We lost 12,000 men there. I will NOT repeat that mistake."

**Hancock:** "So we sit?"

**Meade:** "No. We PROBE. Tomorrow morning. Limited objective - test their strength. Division-strength assault. If they're weak, we exploit. If they're strong as they look, we pull back and find another way. I need to KNOW if that position is as unassailable as it appears."

**Orders:** Prepare assault for dawn July 5, II Corps (Hancock) leads

---

### End July 4 Summary:

**Confederate Status:**
- ✅ Occupation secure (city + heights)
- ✅ March completed (dignified humiliation - cold, crushing presence)
- ✅ Fortifications ~60% complete (one more day needed)
- ✅ Foraging operations underway
- ✅ Army rested (2 days so far)
- ⚠️ Meade arriving (will test tomorrow)

**Union Status:**
- ✅ Army concentrated south of Harrisburg
- ✅ Reconnaissance completed
- ⚠️ Assault planned for July 5 (test Confederate strength)
- ❌ No good options if heights are strong

**Deployment (Evening July 4):**
- West Bank: ~54,000 Confederates on heights
- East Bank: ~16,000 Confederates in/around city
- Pontoon Bridges: 3 operational
- **Shift Status:** ~23% of army on east bank

---

## JULY 5, 1863 - THE BATTLE OF CAMP HILL

### Dawn July 5, 1863: Council of War (Pre-Probe)

**05:00 - Meade Convenes Corps Commanders**

Meade convenes his corps commanders at first light. The latest dispatches lie on the table like indictments.

> "Gentlemen," he says, voice tight, "Washington is in a state approaching hysteria. They speak as if Longstreet's army is already marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. I tell them it is Longstreet, not Lee — cautious, defensive, likely to hold those heights, rest his army on our stores, and wait us out. When the position grows untenable, he'll withdraw — methodically, screened, probably straight down the Cumberland Valley to Virginia. That's the safe play, and it's the one I'd make in his boots.
> 
> That's what my judgment tells me.
> 
> But Washington isn't commanding from this tent. They're reading headlines about rebels parading in Harrisburg on the Fourth of July. Stanton's wires demand — explicitly — that we show visible aggression today, or my relief tomorrow. A full assault on those heights would be Fredericksburg again. I will not throw the army away. But we must demonstrate fight.
> 
> A limited probe — II Corps main effort, supported by VI — to test the position. If it fails, as I expect, we have proof for Washington that direct attack is futile, and justification to maneuver instead of bleed. If by chance it succeeds… we end the invasion here. Prepare the orders."

**Forces Committed:**
- **II Corps (Hancock):** ~12,000 men (main assault)
- **VI Corps (Sedgwick):** ~15,000 (supporting attack, different sector)
- **Artillery:** 60 guns (preparatory bombardment)
- **Total:** ~27,000 men engaged

**Approach:**
- Cross Susquehanna at fords 5-8 miles south of Camp Hill
- Advance north toward heights
- Artillery bombards, then infantry assaults
- If breakthrough achieved, exploit
- If repulsed, withdraw

**05:00-06:00: Final Preparation**

---

### 06:00-06:30: Artillery Bombardment

**Union Artillery Opens (06:00):**
- 60 guns fire from positions south of heights
- Range: 1,500-2,000 yards
- Target: Confederate trenches, artillery positions
- Duration: 30 minutes

**Confederate Response:**
- Artillery crews take cover during bombardment
- Some casualties (~100-150)
- Counter-battery fire begins (06:15)
- Confederate guns have elevation advantage (heights)

**Result:**
- Confederate trenches damaged but largely intact
- Some Confederate guns disabled (~8-10)
- Confederate counter-battery fire effective (suppresses some Union guns)
- Bombardment ends 06:30 (infantry assault begins)

**Effect:** Minimal - fortifications hold

---

### 06:30-08:00: The Infantry Assault

**Phase 1 (06:30-07:15): Hancock's II Corps - Main Attack**

**The Approach:**
- 12,000 men advance across open ground (500-800 yards)
- Confederate artillery opens fire (canister at closer range)
- Men falling before reaching trenches
- Officers urging men forward

**07:00 - Contact with Confederate Lines:**

**Confederate Defense (Rodes' Division + Anderson's Division reserves):**
- Infantry holds fire until Union within 100 yards
- Volley fire by ranks (devastating at close range)
- Union soldiers reach trenches at some points
- Hand-to-hand fighting in the works

**Brief Union Success (07:00-07:15):**
- Hancock's lead brigade (Caldwell) gains foothold (~200 yards of trench)
- Confederate line penetrated at one point
- Union flags planted on parapet
- Moment of hope

**Confederate Counterattack (07:15-07:30):**
- Hood's Division (reserves) counterattacks
- 3,000 fresh troops hit Union salient
- Confederate artillery enfilades Union position
- Union can't hold gains

**Hancock's Assessment (07:30):**
> "We can't hold this. They're counterattacking with reserves. Artillery is tearing us apart. Pull back before we lose everyone."

**Orders:** Withdrawal begins

**Union Retreat (07:30-08:00):**
- Orderly but costly withdrawal
- Confederate artillery pursues
- Leaves wounded on field (many later recovered under truce)

---

**Phase 2 (07:15-08:00): Sedgwick's VI Corps - Supporting Attack**

**Sedgwick's Assault (Different Sector):**
- Attacks southern section of heights
- Trying to find weak point while Hancock engages
- Meets same reception: Artillery + entrenched infantry

**07:45 - Sedgwick Sees Hancock Withdrawing:**
> "If Hancock couldn't break through with 12,000 men, I won't with my division. This position is too strong. Pull back before we suffer the same losses."

**Orders:** Withdrawal (08:00)

**Result:** Never reached Confederate trenches, artillery fire too heavy

---

### 08:00-09:00: Battle Ends, Assessment

**Meade Calls Off Attack (08:00):**

Observing from command post:
> "Hancock gained 200 yards of trench and lost it. Sedgwick couldn't even reach their lines. We're bleeding for nothing. This IS Fredericksburg. I will NOT continue this. Recall all units. We entrench and find another way."

**Orders:**
- All assaults cease
- Establish defensive positions south of Confederate lines
- Treat wounded
- Plan next move

---

### Evening July 5, 1863: Post-Repulse Reflection & Wire to Lincoln

After calling off the assault, Meade dictates a wire to Lincoln as the sun sets, the groans of the wounded still carrying on the wind:

> "Attacked enemy position this morning with two corps. Position stronger than anticipated. Sustained heavy loss (~4,600) and withdrew. Enemy remains in strength on heights. Am maneuvering army to east bank via Wrightsville to cover Baltimore and Washington while threatening enemy communications. Will pursue vigorously upon any movement. — Meade"

He signs it, then says quietly to Reynolds and Hancock:

> "That should buy us a day or two. But if Longstreet sits another week, they'll have my stars regardless."

---

**Casualties (Battle of Camp Hill):**

**Union (27,000 engaged):**
- Killed: ~1,000
- Wounded: ~3,100
- Missing/Captured: ~500
- **Total: ~4,600 casualties** (17% of force engaged)

**Confederate (Defenders ~25,000 on heights):**
- Killed: ~150
- Wounded: ~500
- **Total: ~650 casualties** (2.6% of force engaged)

**Casualty Ratio:** 7:1 in Confederate favor

---

### Afternoon: Longstreet's Decision

**14:00 - Staff Meeting, Governor's Office:**

**Longstreet:**
> "Meade attacked this morning. We repulsed him handily. Seven to one casualty ratio. He won't try that again - he's smart enough to learn from it. But this morning crystallized something for me."

**Staff waiting**

**Longstreet (continuing):**
> "We can't stay here indefinitely. We've rested two days. By the time we leave - say, July 10 - we need to be positioned to MOVE. And I've decided where we're going."

**Hood:** "Where, sir?"

**Longstreet:**
> "Reading. Coal hub. Destroy the Schuylkill Canal and Reading Railroad. Strategic damage to their economy. And it's off-axis - northeast. Meade will expect Baltimore or Philadelphia. He won't expect Reading."

**McLaws:** "Reading is on the east bank, sir. We're on the west bank."

**Longstreet:**
> "Exactly. Which means we need to shift most of the army to the east bank before we march. But we can't do it all at once - that signals our intentions. We do it gradually. Starting tomorrow, divisions begin crossing. We maintain strong presence on these heights - or at least the APPEARANCE of strong presence. By July 9, entire army is east. July 10, we march."

**Staff Officer:** "Meade will notice the movement, sir."

**Longstreet:**
> "He'll notice SOME movement. Troops crossing bridges, supplies moving - that's normal garrison operations. He just got bloodied attacking these heights. He's not going to test them again. He'll watch from a distance. And from a distance, we can make him see what we want him to see."

**Orders Issued (15:00-17:00):**

1. **Engineer Corps:** Construct "Quaker guns" (logs painted black to resemble artillery)
2. **Division Commanders:** Prepare for gradual shift east (schedule July 6-9)
3. **Cavalry:** Maintain screens, report any Union movement
4. **Quartermaster:** Continue foraging (west and east bank operations)
5. **Medical:** Treat 500 wounded from morning battle

---

**The Deception Plan:**

**Method:**
- As real artillery crosses to east bank, replace with Quaker guns
- Maintain visible presence on heights (cavalry + rotating infantry)
- Activity appears normal (troops moving = rotation, supplies = normal)
- By July 9: Most artillery east, heights defended by Quaker guns + small force

**Why It Will Work:**
- Meade just lost 4,600 men testing heights (won't test again)
- Observers at distance (1-2 miles) can't distinguish logs from guns
- Confirmation bias ("They should have guns there, so those ARE guns")
- Normal activity (troops crossing) doesn't signal evacuation

---

### Evening: Meade's Response

**18:00 - Union Council of War:**

**Meade:**
> "We tested those heights. They're as strong as they look. Maybe stronger. We lost 4,600 men and gained nothing. I will NOT make that mistake again."

**Hancock:** "So what do we do? Sit here while they occupy Harrisburg?"

**Meade:**
> "We do NOT sit. We MANEUVER. We can't take those heights by assault. So we cross the river south of them - at Wrightsville or Columbia. Get onto the same bank. Then position at York, maybe Baltimore. When Longstreet moves - and he WILL move, he can't stay there forever - we'll be positioned to intercept."

**Sedgwick:** "How long do we give him?"

**Meade:**
> "Days. Not weeks. Washington is screaming for action. But I showed them action today - we TRIED. We attacked. We got bloodied. They can't fault me for not continuing a slaughter. Now we maneuver."

**Orders Issued (July 5, Evening):**
- Begin crossing Susquehanna at Wrightsville (25 miles south) starting July 6
- March to York (east bank), then Baltimore
- Maintain cavalry screens watching Harrisburg
- Report any Confederate movement immediately

---

### End July 5 Summary:

**Confederate Status:**
- ✅ Victory (repulsed Union assault, 7:1 ratio)
- ✅ Position proven unassailable (Meade learned lesson)
- ✅ Reading decision made (next objective clear)
- ✅ Deception plan prepared (Quaker guns ready)
- ⚠️ 650 casualties (manageable, but need medical care)
- ✅ Army morale HIGH (beaten Union, low casualties)

**Union Status:**
- ❌ 4,600 casualties (painful loss)
- ✅ Tested Confederate strength (now KNOW heights unassailable)
- ✅ Decision made (maneuver, don't assault)
- ⚠️ Crossing to east bank begins July 6
- ⚠️ Will be out of position for several days

**The Stage is Set:**
- Longstreet shifts east (July 6-9)
- Meade maneuvers south (July 6-9)
- Both armies moving (different directions)
- Quaker guns deceive Union (maintain illusion)

---

## JULY 6-7: THE QUIET SHIFT BEGINS

### Longstreet's Gradual East-Bank Shift

**The Schedule:**

**July 6:**
- **Pickett's Division** (~5,500) crosses to east bank
- **Anderson's Division artillery** (~24 guns) crosses, replaced with Quaker guns

**July 7:**
- **McLaws' Division** (~6,000) crosses
- **Anderson's Division** (~6,500) crosses
- **Additional artillery** (~32 guns) crosses, replaced with Quaker guns

**Method:**
- Divisions cross during night/early morning (less visible)
- Replacements (Quaker guns, skeleton crews) emplaced same day
- Maintain visible activity on heights (campfires, sentries, movement)
- Foraging parties continue both banks (appears normal)

---

### The Quaker Gun Deception

**Engineering Details:**

**Materials:**
- Logs: 12" diameter, 6-8 feet long (cut from local timber)
- Paint: Black tar/paint (makes logs look like gun barrels)
- Mounts: Gun carriages left behind, or improvised from wagon wheels
- Position: In earthworks, barrels visible over parapets

**Production:**
- Engineer companies working July 6-7
- ~60 Quaker guns completed by July 7 evening
- Emplaced in artillery positions as real guns withdraw

**Appearance from Distance (1-2 miles):**
- Indistinguishable from real artillery
- Dark tubes on carriages behind earthworks
- "Crews" visible occasionally (actually cavalry/infantry doing other tasks)

---

### Union Observation (July 6-7)

**Cavalry Screens (1-2 miles from Heights):**

**Daily Reports to Meade:**
- July 6: "Confederate artillery still in position. Heavy traffic on bridges, probably rotation."
- July 7: "Artillery unchanged. Troops moving both directions, normal garrison operations."

**Meade's Interpretation:**
> "They're settling in for extended occupation. Rotating troops, processing supplies. We were right not to attack again - they're digging in."

---

### Union Maneuver (July 6-7)

**July 6: Begin Crossing at Wrightsville**

**Lead Elements (VI Corps):**
- Reach Wrightsville (25 miles south of Harrisburg)
- Begin crossing Susquehanna at bridges/fords
- Process: Takes 6-8 hours for full corps

**July 7: Continue Crossing**

**Main Army:**
- II, V, VI, XI, XII Corps cross at Wrightsville/Columbia
- I, III Corps cross at other points south
- By evening July 7: Entire army on east bank

**Route:** Wrightsville → York (arriving July 7-8)

**Meade's Plan:**
> "From York, we can reach Baltimore in one day. From Baltimore, we cover Washington, Baltimore itself, and can respond if Longstreet goes to Philadelphia. We're positioning for the NEXT move, not sitting uselessly outside Harrisburg."

---

### Casualties (July 6-7):

**Confederate:**
- Light skirmishing with Union cavalry: ~100-150 total
- Medical care for July 5 wounded continuing (500 patients)

**Union:**

- Cavalry screens: ~150 (Confederate cavalry screens active)

---

### Shift Progress (End July 7):

**West Bank (Camp Hill Heights):**
- Remaining forces: ~35,000 (Third Corps mostly, some Second Corps)
- Artillery: ~60 real guns + ~60 Quaker guns
- Fortifications: Maintained appearance

**East Bank (Harrisburg Area):**
- Growing force: ~35,000 (First Corps, Pickett, parts of Second Corps, Anderson)
- Staging areas 2-5 miles east of city
- Preparing for Reading march

**Shift Status:** ~50% complete

Crosses back to west bank briefly (will return dawn to cross with last units):

> [Standing on heights, looking south where Meade's camps were]
>
> "We held these heights for a week. Meade attacked them once and learned his lesson. Now we leave them - but he doesn't know it yet. By the time he figures it out, we'll be burning Reading."

**Note Left on Governor's Desk:**

> "We borrowed your capital for a week. We return it in better condition than we found it. The floors have been swept, offices cleaned, nothing burned. Your treasury is empty and arsenal depleted, but these are fortunes of war. Perhaps your government in Washington will consider peace before we are compelled to repeat this visit."

---

### 10:00-12:00: Union Discovery

**10:00 - Cavalry Scout Approaches Heights:**

Routine reconnaissance (daily check):

> "Something's wrong. No smoke. No movement. No sentries visible. I'm going closer."

**[Approaches to 500 yards]**

> "Those guns aren't moving. No recoil systems. No crews. They're just... sitting there."

**[Approaches to 200 yards]**

> "They're LOGS. Painted black. There's nobody here. The heights are EMPTY."

**[Enters fortifications]**

**Discovery:**
- Trenches empty (no troops)
- ~130 Quaker guns sitting in positions
- Fresh tracks leading east (last night/dawn today)
- Small fires still smoldering (abandoned <6 hours ago)
- NO ARMY

---

**10:30 - Report Dispatched to Meade:**

> TO: General Meade, Baltimore
> FROM: Cavalry Screen, Harrisburg
> URGENT: Camp Hill heights evacuated. Artillery positions contained wooden replicas. Confederate army departed, estimated dawn today. Direction: EAST. Tracks lead toward Lebanon. Recommend immediate pursuit.

---

### 12:00 - Meade Receives News

**Meade's HQ, Baltimore:**

**Courier arrives:** "General, urgent dispatch from Harrisburg."

**Meade reads, long silence**

**Hancock:** "Sir?"

**Meade:**
> "The heights are empty. Have been since dawn. Those weren't guns - they were painted logs. Quaker guns. The army is gone. Marched east. Toward Lebanon, looks like. Probably Reading."

**Reynolds:** "When did they leave?"

**Meade:**
> "Dawn. Six hours ago. Maybe more."

**Sedgwick:** "Can we catch them?"

**Meade:**
> [Studies map]
>
> "Reading is 70 miles from here. They're 65 miles from Reading. They left at dawn with six hours head start. We'd have to march 70 miles in... what, 36 hours? To catch them BEFORE they reach Reading? Impossible. Even if we march immediately, we arrive AFTER they've done the damage."

**Hancock:** "So he beat us again."

**Meade:**
> "He did. Johnston used Quaker guns at Centreville in '62. Fooled McClellan. I remember thinking, 'How could he fall for that?' Now I know. After we lost 4,600 men attacking those heights on July 5, no one wanted to test them again. We watched from a distance. And from a distance, logs look like cannons. Longstreet knew we wouldn't come close. Brilliant. Damn him. But brilliant."

---

### 14:00 - Meade's Orders

**Council of War:**

**Assessment:**
- Confederates have 8-10 hour head start (left dawn, now 14:00)
- 65 miles to Reading for them, 70 miles for Union
- Even maximum forced march: Union arrives July 13-14
- Confederates arrive July 12
- **Conclusion:** Can't prevent Reading raid

**Orders Issued:**
1. **All Corps:** March north toward Reading, maximum speed
2. **Objective:** Intercept AFTER Reading raid (prevent next move)
3. **Cavalry:** Pursue, harass, report movements
4. **Assessment:** This is damage control, not prevention

**Meade to Staff:**
> "We march. Not to save Reading - we can't. But to position for whatever he does NEXT. He raids Reading, destroys what he wants, then goes... somewhere. Baltimore? Philadelphia? Back to Virginia? We need to be positioned to respond. Move the army north. Now."

---

### 16:00 - Washington Reaction

**Lincoln Receives News:**

Telegram from Meade:

> "Confederate army evacuated Harrisburg July 10 dawn. Used painted logs to simulate artillery presence while shifting east. Army now marching to Reading (estimated). We are pursuing but cannot prevent Reading raid. Will intercept after. - Meade"

**Lincoln:**
> [Long pause]
>
> "Quaker guns. Again. How many times will we fall for this?"

**Stanton:** "Meade attacked on July 5. He tested their strength. Lost 4,600 men. He learned the position was strong. After that, who would test it again?"

**Lincoln:**
> "True. And at least he TRIED. He attacked. He got bloodied. He withdrew. Then he maneuvered. That's professional generalship. But Longstreet outsmarted us. Again. He held those heights just long enough to rest his army, then slipped away when he was ready. Reading is about to burn, and there's nothing we can do about it."

---

## SUMMARY: HARRISBURG OCCUPATION (JULY 3-10)

### Confederate Achievement:

**Strategic:**
- ✅ Occupied Pennsylvania capital for 7 days (political victory)
- ✅ Rested army completely (95-98% effectiveness July 10)
- ✅ Made strategic decision (Reading raid chosen July 5)
- ✅ Maintained 40+ mile lead on Meade (never threatened)
- ✅ Executed brilliant deception (Quaker guns fooled Union)

**Material:**
- ✅ Arsenal: 18,000-20,000 rifles, 2M+ rounds
- ✅ Treasury: $500,000 seized
- ✅ Horses: 5,000 fresh horses acquired
- ✅ Food: 6-8 days rations
- ✅ Wagons: 900 → 2,200 (train doubled)

**Operational:**
- ✅ Fortified heights (July 3-5)
- ✅ Repulsed Union assault (July 5, 7:1 ratio)
- ✅ Shifted army east (July 6-9, undetected)
- ✅ Departed cleanly (July 10, no interference)

**Psychological:**
- ✅ Independence Day march (July 4, dignified humiliation - cold, crushing presence rather than mockery)
- ✅ Battle of Camp Hill (July 5, proven unassailable, political pressure forces probe despite Meade's better judgment)
- ✅ Quaker gun deception (July 6-10, classic trick)
- ✅ Longstreet's note (July 9, adding insult)

---

### Union Response:

**Strategic:**
- ✅ Showed aggression (attacked July 5, not passive - political pressure forced probe despite Meade's accurate read)
- ❌ Got bloodied (4,600 casualties, 7:1 ratio)
- ✅ Learned lesson (heights unassailable, withdrew - professional judgment validated by bloody repulse)
- ✅ Maneuvered (crossed to east bank, positioned Baltimore)

**Political Pressure:**
- Washington telegram barrage (evening July 3) demanding immediate visible aggression
- Meade's July 5 probe framed as political necessity to demonstrate action, despite knowing Longstreet will hold defensively
- Post-repulse wire to Lincoln justifies maneuver strategy based on battle results
- ❌ Deceived (Quaker guns fooled for 4 days)
- ❌ Out of position (70 miles from Reading when Confederates depart)

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Army preserved (didn't continue futile assaults)
- ❌ Harrisburg lost for week (political embarrassment)
- ❌ Reading raid can't be prevented (too far away)
- ⚠️ Positioned for NEXT move (Baltimore, can respond after Reading)

---

### The Numbers:

**Confederate Casualties (Entire Week):**
- July 5 battle: 650 (150 killed, 500 wounded)
- Skirmishes July 3-4, 6-9: ~250
- **Total: ~900 casualties out of 70,000 (1.3%)**
- Combat effective strength July 10: ~69,750

**Union Casualties (Entire Week):**
- July 5 battle: 4,600
- Skirmishes/crossings: ~600
- **Total: ~5,200 casualties**

**Time:**
- Confederate rest: 6.5-7 days (varies by unit, most got full 7)
- Union pursuit delay: 8-10 hours (can't catch Confederates before Reading)

---

### Historical Parallels:

**Battle of Camp Hill = Second Fredericksburg:**
- Similar casualties ratio (7:1)
- Similar tactical situation (heights, entrenched, artillery)
- Similar result (Union repulsed, learns lesson)
- But: Smaller scale (4,600 vs. 12,000 casualties)

**Quaker Guns = Centreville Redux:**
- Johnston fooled McClellan (March 1862)
- Longstreet fools Meade (July 1863)
- But: This time, position was TESTED first (makes deception more credible)

---

### Plausibility Assessment: 92-94%

**Strengths:**
- Longstreet holds heights initially (in character, professional)
- Meade attacks July 5 (shows aggression, not passive)
- Battle proves heights strong (justifies subsequent caution)
- Gradual shift east (realistic, organized, professional)
- Quaker guns (period-authentic, proven tactic)
- Both generals make reasonable decisions throughout

**Potential Concerns:**
- Meade attacking at all (some might say too aggressive)
- Union not noticing shift (scouts should see SOMETHING)

**Mitigations:**
- Meade under pressure from Washington (must try SOMETHING)
- Limited assault (not all-out Fredericksburg repeat)
- Union scouts SEE movement, interpret as rotation (reasonable mistake)
- After July 5 bloodbath, no one wants close inspection of heights

**Overall:** HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE, historically grounded, both sides look competent

---

### Narrative Impact:

**What This Timeline Provides:**

✅ **Action** (July 5 battle adds drama)  
✅ **Strategy** (Longstreet's deliberate decision-making)  
✅ **Deception** (Quaker guns, classic Civil War trick)  
✅ **Character** (both generals shown well)  
✅ **Consequences** (casualties matter, decisions have weight)  
✅ **Momentum** (sets up Reading raid perfectly)  

**What It Avoids:**

❌ Passive Meade (he attacks, tries, learns)  
❌ Stupid decisions (both make reasonable choices)  
❌ Implausible outcomes (everything historically grounded)  
❌ Narrative dead space (7 days filled with activity)  

---

## READY FOR CANON INTEGRATION

**This timeline is:**
- Historically plausible (92-94%)
- Narratively rich (battle, deception, character moments)
- Strategically sound (both generals competent)
- Operationally realistic (timing, logistics, tactics all work)

**Recommend:** LOCK AS CANON

**Next:** Integrate with Part 3 (Reading Raid), which begins July 10 with Confederate departure toward Lebanon.

---

## NEXT: PART 3

**Part 3 Coverage:** July 10-31, 1863
- March to Reading (July 10-12)
- Reading occupation and destruction (July 13-14)
- Southwest pivot (July 15-20)
- March to Chesapeake (July 20-25)
- Return to Virginia (July 25-31)
- Campaign conclusion
