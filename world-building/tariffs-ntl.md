# Tariffs Between the Three Republics (1865-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

How tariffs work between the three republics.

## Tariff Evolution

| Period | U.S. vs CSA | U.S. vs California | CSA vs California | External Tariffs |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **1865–1905** | Punitive tariffs (1865–1905) → zero internal tariffs after 1905 | Zero tariffs from day one (Treaty of Sacramento 1873) | Zero tariffs from 1905 onward | All three negotiate common external tariff every 10 years (first 1905, renewed 1915, 1925, 1935) |
| **1905–1939** | Zero tariffs (Economic Concord 1905) | Zero tariffs | Zero tariffs | Same |
| **Post-1939 (guidance only)** | Zero tariffs forever | Zero tariffs | Zero tariffs | Same |

## Locked Rule That Never Changes

**"No tariff shall ever be raised between the three American republics without the unanimous consent of all three."**

## Real-World Result

**1865–1905:** Cold trade war between U.S. and CSA (punitive tariffs on slave-grown goods).

California is the loophole everyone uses.

**1905:** Toombs repeal → boycott ends → North-American Economic Concord (zero internal tariffs, common external tariff).

**1905–2025:** The continent functions as a single economic zone with three currencies and three flags.

## The Evolution

Tariffs between the three republics:

- **1865–1905:** Weaponised
- **1905–1939:** Zero
- **Forever after:** Zero

It's the one thing they all agree on

because California made it clear

it would sell its oil and ports to the highest bidder

if anyone ever tried to start another trade war.

**Lock it.**

The continent's only successful union

is the one nobody admits exists:

free trade.
