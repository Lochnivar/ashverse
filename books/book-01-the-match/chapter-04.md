# Chapter 4: "Harrisburg"

Daniel's Brigade, Rodes Division, II Corps, ANV
North of Carlisle, Pennsylvania

Major General Robert Rodes pulled his horse up at the front of the army march and dismouted.  

"Nervous, Junius?" he said quietly to Brigider General Junius Daniel, one of his generals, currently at the head of the march.

"The Lord commands that we shall not bear false witness, so it would be sin if I said no, sir".  Both men chuckled at the joke and quickly sobered up.  "Can I be honest with you, Robert?"

Though technically his junior officer, both men were of about the same age and the informality felt natural.

"Always," Rodes said.

"I don't think I've ever been this nervous about a march."  Daniel pulled his hat off and let it swing in his left hand as his right rested on the sword.  "I expected a real dust up in Gettysburg.  I haven't quite adjusted to the idea of not being in a battle this morning."

"I understand that," Rodes nodded.  "But, you might get your chance when we get to Harrisburg.  Lord knows Carlisle didn't put up any fight.  Harrisburg is the capital."

Daniel nodded and a brief, uncomfortable silence threatened.

"I see your brigade is just about ready to lead us to glory, Junius?"  Rodes motioned to the lines forming behind them.  Just over seven thousand men in rebel gray, and a few others in butternut brown.

"Just about sir."  Daniel nodded and straightened his spine, his pride in his brigade was evident.  "Give us fifteen minutes and we'll step off smartly."

"See you in Harrisburg then.  Give them hell, Junius."  Rodes extended a hand and Daniel shook it."

Leister House
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

Almost twenty-four hours later, Gibbon and Haskell still noted the hornet's nest activity of the previous day, but this activity had context.  Haskell could read the concern, and distaste, on the faces of the men entering and leaving the Leister House.  Both emotions were locked firmly behind granite military discipline, but a veteran like Haskell could see the signs.  All men had them and even rigid military training couldn't remove the tells completely.

"I believe that we're not going to find satisfaction this morning, Frank." Gibbon's tone seemed to indicate that the general had noticed the difference as well.  After last night's mild reprimand, such a comment only highlighted Gibbon's internal stress and disappointment.  Haskell only nodded, not trusting himself to speak.

General Meade stood in the house, his coat on and looking better than he had yesterday.  He didn't look rested, but his eyes were once again clear and reasonably alert.  Maps and reports were strewn across the table and a tin cup of coffee steamed at the near corner.  His staff crowded around the table, but Major General Butterfield noticed Gibbon and touched Meade on the forearm to get his attention.

Meade looked up and motioned Gibbon forward.  The staff parted the way and made room for Gibbon at the table.

"Good morning to you, General.  How are your men?"  Meade asked.

"Rested sir, and ready for a fight" Gibbon said.  "We're ready to pursue."

Meade flinched, just a bit.  Gibbon hadn't meant for the response to be an insult, but Meade obviously took the reference to heart.

"I appreciate the eagerness of your men, General Gibbon," Meade's voice was a touch more frosty.  "However, I'm still not fully convinced that Lee has given up the battle here.  I've ordered Buford to report movements by noon and I'll be riding to see the lines personally in about thirty minutes or so."

"I believe the prudent thing to do is to begin prepping for departure, but let's not break down the lines quite yet.  I've moving Slocum and Sykes north.  One thing we're positive is that Lee isn't to our south and we need those men for reserves if he makes a sudden strike at our lines."

"Aye sir." Gibbon gave a quick salute and turned.  Haskell followed him and waited until they had left out of earshot before cursing a blue streak his priest wouldn't have approved of.

"Patience, Frank." Gibbon said.

"He's jumping at ghosts, sir!"

"Yes, but these are Chancelorsville ghosts, a very deadly and dangerous type."  Gibbon sighed.  "You know my feelings on this, Frank, but can we afford another disaster like that?  It may be frustrating, but what harm can waiting to make sure Lee isn't planning something?"

Little Round Top
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

The young courier huffed as he finally crested the hill and looked about.  He found Chamberlain by the insignia on his coat and trotted over.

"Colonel Chamberlain?"  He quickly saluted.

"Yes, that's me."  Chamberlain returned the salute.

"That's quite the climb, sir!"  The youth handed over a folded piece of paper.  "Orders from Colonel Vincent."

Chamberlain took the paper and nodded to the nearest cookfire.

"Thank you, have a quick cup while I read this."

The courier nodded his thanks and Chamberlain unfolded the paper.  The orders were what he had half expected and Chamberlain felt his gut clench.  

Last night had been -- anticlimactic.  The rebel assault never materialized but the constant need for vigilance had robbed the men of their rest.  The lack of cookfires down the hill had actually been more disquieting than they would have been.  Cookfires would have meant the rebels were settling down for the night.  Chamberlain himself had been awake until well after midnight scanning the rebel lines, looking for the anticipated assault, before Tom and Sergeant Tozier had respectfully, but firmly, convinced him to get to his bedroll.

The men of the 2nd Maine hadn't been hesitant to express their opinions.  Tom and the sergeants had done their best to segregate them to keep discipline high, but even Chamberlain had overheard scattered conversations about "building breastworks to defend against fucking squirrels".  These orders would only make that feeling of frustration much worse.

Tom had noticed the arrival of the courier and had risen from his own campfire to join Chamberlain.

"Orders?"  He asked.

Chamberlain handed the orders over to Tom.

"Yes, we're moving out.  General Meade's staff has determined there are no rebels south of here and we're moving out to be a reserve up near Cemetery Hill."

Tom cursed and read the orders while Chamberlain motioned for the courier.

"Give Colonel Vincent my compliments and acknowledgements.  The 20th will be on the move as soon as we can."

The courier gave one final salute and a quick stop at the cookfire to thank them for the coffee, then he was back down the hill.  Chamberlain stood for a moment, giving the downhill a final clear sweep.  The breastworks they had spent hours on, and convinced the 2nd Maine to assist with, stood empty.  A monument to a night's frustration.

"Fucking squirrels", he growled to himself.
