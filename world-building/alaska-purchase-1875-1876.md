**Territory:** All of Russian America (modern Alaska, Aleutian Islands, etc.)

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Public Reason
"Peaceful commercial transaction for the mutual benefit of both nations"

### Private California Brief
"The purchase removes the last plausible staging point for any power wishing to contest Californian dominion of the Pacific."

### California's Strategic Goals
- Completes California's unbroken Pacific coastline from Baja California to the Arctic Circle
- Denies any European or remnant U.S. foothold in the North Pacific
- Secures northern Pacific trade routes
- Prevents potential military staging areas
- Establishes California as the dominant Pacific power

---

## Russian Motivation

1. **Immediate cash infusion** - $12 million in gold (significant sum in 1875)
2. **Avoids risk of British seizure** - Russia feared British would take it in a future war
3. **Avoids forced cession** - Better to sell voluntarily than lose it
4. **Territory was unprofitable** - Russian America was a financial drain
5. **California is reliable buyer** - Neutral, wealthy, unlikely to threaten Russia

## Historical Context

### OTL Alaska Purchase (1867)
- **Date:** 30 March 1867
- **Price:** $7.2 million USD
- **Buyer:** United States
- **Rationale:** Similar (strategic, prevent British seizure)

### NTL Differences
- **Date:** 1875-1876 (8-9 years later)
- **Price:** $12 million (adjusted for inflation/timing, or California pays premium)
- **Buyer:** Republic of California (not United States)
- **Rationale:** California's Pacific dominance strategy

---

## Why California, Not the U.S.?

1. **U.S. is exhausted** - Just finished Civil War, broke, focused on reconstruction
2. **California is wealthy** - Gold, oil, trade revenue, can afford $12 million
3. **California is independent** - Can act on its own (1873 independence)
4. **Strategic interest** - California needs Pacific dominance more than U.S. does
5. **Geographic logic** - Alaska is closer to California than to East Coast U.S.

---

## The Ceremony (4 July 1876)

**Location:** New Archangel (renamed Bearfort)  
**Date:** California's third Independence Day (1873, 1874, 1875, **1876**)  
**Flag:** Bear Flag Republic of California raised  
**Significance:** Symbolic completion of California's Pacific coastline

---

## Impact

### Immediate (1876)
- California gains massive territory (Alaska is huge)
- Completes Pacific coastline control
- Denies staging points to other powers
- Establishes California as major Pacific power

### Long-term (1876-1939)
- Alaska becomes California territory (District, then Territory of Alyeska)
- Strategic buffer against any Pacific threats
- Resource potential (gold, oil, fish, timber)
- Trade routes secured
- California's Pacific dominance solidified

---

## Plausibility Assessment

**Rating:** ✅ **9/10 - HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Russia wanted to sell Alaska (OTL fact)
- California is wealthy and independent (can afford it)
- Strategic logic is sound (Pacific dominance)
- Timing is reasonable (1875, after California independence)
- Price is defensible ($12M vs. OTL $7.2M - inflation or premium)

**Minor Concerns:**
- U.S. might object, but has no leverage (exhausted, broke)
- Price might be high, but California can afford it
- Russia might prefer U.S., but California is reliable buyer

**Verdict:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Well-justified, historically grounded, strategically logical.
