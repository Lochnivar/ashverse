## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Atlanta Campaign NTL (May 1864 - January 1865)**

Sherman begins advance from Chattanooga May 1864 (same as OTL). Advances through June-July 1864 with Johnston retreating (similar to OTL). Hood replaces Johnston July 17, 1864 (CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success with Pickett Raid and Hancock wounded, need aggressive action in West). Siege of Atlanta August-November 1864 (Sherman reaches suburbs, Hood defends). McClellan elected November 1864 (war has expiration date). Sherman withdraws January 1865 (peace negotiations beginning).

**Result:** Atlanta besieged but never falls. Ambiguous outcome - neither side wins decisively. Explains Sherman's post-war reputation (tactical success, strategic failure).

## DETAILED TIMELINE BREAKDOWN

### May 1864: Sherman Begins Advance

**Location:** Chattanooga

**Sherman's Force:** ~100,000 men (same as OTL)

**Johnston's Force:** ~60,000 men (similar to OTL)

**Strategy:** Same as OTL - Sherman advances, Johnston retreats

**Progress:** Similar to OTL - steady advance through North Georgia

**Plausibility:** 95% - Independent of Eastern Theater events

---

### June-July 1864: Advance and Retreat

**June 1864:**
- Sherman continues advance
- Johnston continues retreat
- Similar to OTL - no major battles, steady pressure

**July 1864:**
- Sherman reaches outskirts of Atlanta area
- Johnston prepares defensive positions
- Similar to OTL - approaching Atlanta

**Key Difference from OTL:**
- OTL: Johnston replaced July 17, 1864 (before Atlanta Campaign fully begins)
- NTL: Johnston replaced July 17, 1864 (after Eastern Theater success - Pickett Raid and Hancock wounded)

**Plausibility:** 90% - Timeline similar to OTL, but Hood replacement triggered by Eastern Theater success creating opportunity

---

### July 12, 1864: Hancock Wounded (Eastern Theater)

**Event:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead) - **CSA victory**

**Context:**
- Pickett's Lightning Raid (June 8-28, 1864) was successful - threatened Washington
- Hancock wounded while pursuing Pickett - last Northern hero falls
- **CSA star is ascendant** - Eastern Theater success

**Impact on Western Theater:**
- CSA leadership sees opportunity
- Eastern success creates momentum
- Need aggressive action in West to capitalize
- Hood seen as more aggressive than Johnston - can press advantage

**Plausibility:** 90% - Eastern Theater success creates opportunity for Western Theater aggression

---

### July 17, 1864: Hood Replaces Johnston

**Timing:** 5 days after Hancock wounded (July 12)

**CSA Reasoning:**
- **Eastern Theater success** - Pickett Raid successful, Hancock wounded
- **CSA star is ascendant** - momentum building
- **Seize opportunity** - press advantage in West while East is winning
- Need aggressive action to capitalize on Eastern success
- Hood seen as more willing to fight than Johnston

**Hood's Strategy:**
- Defend Atlanta aggressively
- Refuse to retreat
- Hold city at all costs
- Press advantage while Eastern Theater is winning

**Plausibility:** 87% - Hood replacement triggered by Eastern Theater success creating opportunity, not desperation

**Key Difference from OTL:**
- OTL: Hood replaced Johnston because Johnston was too cautious
- NTL: Hood replaced Johnston because CSA sees opportunity - Eastern success creates momentum, need aggressive action in West

---

### August-November 1864: Siege of Atlanta

**Duration:** 4 months (August-November 1864)

**Sherman's Position:**
- Reaches Atlanta suburbs
- Establishes siege lines
- Cannot break through Hood's defenses

**Hood's Position:**
- Defends Atlanta aggressively
- Refuses to retreat
- Holds city despite siege

**Result:** Stalemate - Sherman cannot take Atlanta, Hood cannot break siege

**Plausibility:** 88% - 4-month siege realistic, neither side wins decisively

**Key Difference from OTL:**
- OTL: Atlanta falls September 2, 1864
- NTL: Atlanta besieged but never falls

---

### November 1864: McClellan Elected

**Event:** McClellan wins election on peace platform

**Impact on Atlanta Campaign:**
- War has expiration date
- Peace negotiations beginning
- Sherman's siege becomes less urgent

**Plausibility:** 95% - Established canon, affects Sherman's strategy

---

### January 1865: Sherman Withdraws

**Timing:** Early January 1865

**Reason:** Peace negotiations beginning after McClellan elected

**Sherman's Decision:**
- Withdraws from Atlanta siege
- Prepares for potential peace
- Keeps army intact

**Hood's Response:**
- Holds Atlanta
- Claims victory (city never fell)
- Prepares for peace negotiations

**Plausibility:** 90% - Logical response to peace negotiations beginning

**Connection to Sherman's March:**
- January 25, 1865: Sherman receives Grant's telegram
- January 29, 1865: Sherman begins march to Appomattox
- Timeline works: Withdraws from Atlanta → Receives telegram → Begins march

---

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### Why This Timeline Works

**1. Strategic Sense:**
- Sherman still advances (same as OTL)
- Hood still defends (same as OTL)
- Timeline realistic (4 months to reach Atlanta, 3 months siege)

**2. Ambiguous Outcome:**
- Neither side wins decisively
- Fits theme: "Everyone is wrong"
- No clear victor in Western Theater

**3. Explains Sherman's Post-War Reputation:**
- Tactical success (reached Atlanta, besieged it)
- Strategic failure (never took it, withdrew)
- "The General Who Almost Won"

**4. Connects to Sherman's March:**
- Withdraws from Atlanta January 1865
- Receives Grant's telegram January 25, 1865
- Begins march to Appomattox January 29, 1865
- Timeline flows naturally

## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OTL

| Aspect | OTL | NTL | Why Different |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Johnston Replacement** | July 17, 1864 (too cautious) | July 17, 1864 (CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success creates momentum) | Eastern Theater success creates opportunity for Western aggression |
| **Atlanta Campaign Outcome** | Atlanta falls September 2, 1864 | Atlanta besieged but never falls | War ends before Sherman can take it |
| **Sherman's March to the Sea** | November-December 1864 | Never happens | War ends before it can happen |
| **Sherman's Post-War Reputation** | "The General Who Won the West" | "The General Who Almost Won" | Tactical success, strategic failure |

## POST-WAR MYTHOLOGY

### Northern Narrative

> "Sherman reached Atlanta. He besieged it for four months. He would have taken it if the war hadn't ended. Hood held on by luck, not skill. If McClellan had been elected earlier, or if Sherman had started his advance earlier, Atlanta would have fallen."

### Southern Narrative

> "Hood defended Atlanta against Sherman's entire army. Four months of siege, and the city never fell. Sherman withdrew because he couldn't take it. Hood's defense saved the West. If the war had continued, Sherman would have been forced to withdraw anyway."

### Historical Debate (1865-1939)

**Question 1:** Could Sherman have taken Atlanta if the war continued?
- "Yes, he was close to breaking through..."
- "No, Hood's defenses were too strong..."

**Question 2:** Why did Hood replace Johnston?
- "Because Johnston was too cautious..."
- "Because CSA saw opportunity - Eastern success created momentum..."

**Question 3:** Was Sherman's withdrawal strategic or forced?
- "Strategic - peace negotiations beginning..."
- "Forced - couldn't break Hood's defenses..."

**The Truth:** All three perspectives have merit.

## CONNECTION TO SHERMAN'S MARCH TO APPOMATTOX

**Timeline Flow:**

1. **January 1865 (Early):** Sherman withdraws from Atlanta siege
2. **January 25, 1865:** Sherman receives Grant's telegram
3. **January 29, 1865:** Sherman begins march to Appomattox

**Why This Works:**

- Sherman's army is intact (withdrew from siege, not defeated)
- Sherman is available (not tied down in Atlanta)
- Timeline allows for march (January 29 - February 20, 1865)
- Makes strategic sense (Grant needs help, Sherman can provide it)

**Result:** Atlanta Campaign ends → Sherman's March begins → Perfect narrative flow
