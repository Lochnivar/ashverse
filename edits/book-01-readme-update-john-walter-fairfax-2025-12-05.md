# Book 1 README Update: John Walter Fairfax as Primary POV

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** SUGGESTED EDIT  
**File:** `books/book-01-the-match/README.md`

## CHANGES NEEDED

### Update Key Characters Section

**Current:**
```
- **Fairfax Family** - Prominent family, likely Confederate-aligned or neutral observers
- **Haskell Family** - Prominent family, likely Union-aligned or neutral observers (Gen 0: Frank A. Haskell, Union officer at Gettysburg)
```

**Should be:**
```
- **John Walter Fairfax** - Primary Fairfax POV in "The Match" (CSA officer, likely Longstreet aide or staff)
- **Thomas Reginald Fairfax** - Primary Fairfax POV in "The Fire" (switches from John Walter)
- **Frank A. Haskell** - Primary Haskell POV in "The Match" (Union officer, aide to General Gibbon at Gettysburg, Gen 0 of Haskell family)
- **Fairfax Family** - Prominent family, likely Confederate-aligned or neutral observers
- **Haskell Family** - Prominent family, likely Union-aligned or neutral observers
```

### Update Major Plot Points Section

**Current:**
```
7. **Resolution:** The new status quo is established, but tensions and problems are clearly visible for the future
```

**Should be:**
```
7. **Final Scene:** Major Haskell summoned by Major John Walter Fairfax to address reports of Northern raiders burning cotton fields. Haskell's defiant response: "Prove they are Northern soldiers or be damned. You have your independence, you have your slaves, now piss off. Good day sir." (After armistice, before Treaty of Cincinnati takes effect)
8. **Resolution:** The new status quo is established, but tensions and problems are clearly visible for the future
```

## RATIONALE

1. **Clarifies Primary POV Characters:** Makes it clear that John Walter Fairfax is the primary Fairfax POV in "The Match," not Thomas Reginald Fairfax
2. **Establishes Character Transition:** Notes that the POV switches to Thomas Reginald Fairfax for "The Fire"
3. **Adds Final Scene:** Documents the key final scene confrontation between Haskell and Fairfax
4. **Maintains Consistency:** Aligns with the cast list and character documents

**Status:** SUGGESTED EDIT - User to review and implement manually
