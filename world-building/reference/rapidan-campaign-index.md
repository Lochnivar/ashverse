## Campaign Overview

The Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign (August-December 1863) was the first major Union offensive after the POD Campaign disaster. Under intense political pressure, newly-appointed commander Gouverneur Warren attempted to break Longstreet's fortified line along the Rappahannock-Rapidan rivers.

The campaign ended in catastrophic Union defeat, with the Army of the Potomac suffering approximately 47,000 casualties while inflicting only 12,000 on the Confederates.
