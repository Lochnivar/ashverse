# Hawaii in the NTL

## OTL vs. NTL (1893-1898)

| OTL Event (1893–1898) | NTL version (realistic outcome) | Likelihood |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1893 – Overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani by American planters + U.S. Marines | **Happens almost exactly the same.** The planters are the same sugar barons, the USS Boston is still in Honolulu harbour. The U.S. minister still cables for marines. | 10/10 |
| 1894 – Republic of Hawaii declared | **Still happens.** The provisional government becomes the Republic. Same white oligarchy. | 10/10 |
| 1894–1897 – Cleveland refuses annexation, then McKinley pushes it | **This is where the NTL diverges hard.** Cleveland still hates imperialism, but a **weakened, post-war U.S.** has no political will or naval power to enforce anything. | 8/10 |
| 1898 – U.S. annexes Hawaii as war measure (Spanish-American War) | **Does NOT happen.** There is no Spanish-American War (or it's tiny and irrelevant). The U.S. Navy is split, underfunded, and busy protecting the mainland coasts. | 1/10 |

## Realistic NTL Hawaii Outcome (1898–2025)

| Year | What actually happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **1898–1905** | Republic of Hawaii limps along as a white planter oligarchy. Japan and Britain circle like sharks (both have big naval bases within a week's steaming). |
| **1905–1915** | Japan makes the move it always wanted OTL: quiet protectorate → full annexation. Hawaii becomes a **Japanese territory** (exactly what Japan threatened OTL in 1897 when Cleveland backed down). |
| **1915–1945** | Japanese Hawaii – naval base, sugar plantations, heavy militarisation. Pearl Harbor becomes a **Japanese fleet anchorage**. |
| **1945–2025** | After a Pacific War analogue (Japan vs. Britain/France/California/U.S.), Hawaii either: <br>1. Becomes independent (most likely) <br>2. Stays Japanese (if Japan wins) <br>3. Ends up California-aligned (if California wins the Pacific) |

## Likelihood of "Japanese Hawaii" in the NTL: 9/10

The U.S. in your timeline is simply **too weak, too broke, and too distracted** to stop it.

- No Spanish-American War = no excuse for annexation.
- No transcontinental land bridge = no strategic depth to project power.
- A victorious but exhausted North has zero appetite for another war over "some sugar islands."

Japan takes Hawaii the way it took Taiwan OTL — quietly, bloodlessly, and with the West too busy to care.

## Result

In the NTL, **there is no U.S. state of Hawaii**.

There is the **Kingdom/Republic of Hawaiʻi under Japanese protection** → later **Territory of Hawaii** in the Empire of Japan → post-1945 either independent or a Japanese/California condominium.

Another thing the North thought it owned that quietly slipped away because it was too far and too tired to hold on.
