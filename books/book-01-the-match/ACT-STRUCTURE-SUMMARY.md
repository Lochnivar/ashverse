**Act 3 → Act 4:** Political transition (McClellan inauguration)

## STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES

- **Flexible chapter count:** Story dictates length; high-drama periods get granular treatment
- **Interludes for transitions:** Political/static beats handled as vignettes to maintain momentum
- **Pacing:** Battle-heavy acts get full chapters; compressed phases use vignette style
- **Thematic progression:** Each act builds on previous failures toward final collapse
