## Book Blurb
Two decades after the match was struck, the fire burns across the continent. The independent Confederacy struggles to maintain its economy and identity. Native American tribes have consolidated into powerful sovereign super-states, reshaping the political landscape. California has quietly seceded, becoming the Republic of California. And slavery, while still legal in the Confederacy, is dying in practice—kept alive by law but strangled by economics and international pressure.

Through the eyes of the Fairfax and Meade bloodlines, and those caught in the flames, we witness a continent in transformation. Raids across borders. Economic boycotts. Realpolitik that makes strange bedfellows. The old certainties are gone, and everyone is learning to navigate a world where the rules have changed.

The fire is burning. The question is: what will be left when it's done?

## Core Plot
The 1880s and 1890s see the new continental order tested and reshaped. The Confederacy faces economic crises and must make difficult choices about slavery and its place in the world. Native super-states assert their sovereignty and power. California establishes itself as an independent republic. The Union watches, sometimes intervenes, and sometimes steps back.

The narrative follows multiple storylines: economic warfare between nations, border conflicts, diplomatic maneuvering, and the daily lives of people trying to survive in this new world. The immortal bloodlines continue to observe and sometimes intervene, their long perspectives providing insight into the patterns of history.
