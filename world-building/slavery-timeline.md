# Slavery Timeline in the Confederacy

## 1867-68: The Toombs "African Labour Restoration Act"

### What Happens
- Toombs re-opens the African trade
- The "Second Middle Passage" begins
- Thousands imported over the next two decades

### What People Remember in 2025
**"The Second Middle Passage"** – Toombs's suicidal arrogance

## 1870-1888: The "Toombs Boom" (Bitter Irony)

### What Happens
- Trade runs full-bore. Thousands imported.
- Boycott crushes CSA economy
- Global cotton glut + raids + boycott + runaway crisis

### What People Remember in 2025
**The "Toombs Boom"** – bitter irony, the boom that broke the economy

## 1888-1894: The Death in Practice

### What Happens
- Global cotton glut + raids + boycott + runaway crisis → last states pass **private manumission laws** and **ban new imports**
- Slavery is no longer economically viable
- No new slaves can be born or imported after 1894

### What People Remember in 2025
**"1894 – The Last Chain Falls"** – the emotional, moral, and practical end. The last child who will ever be born a slave is born this year.

## 1894–1905: The Zombie Years (Probation)

### Legal Status
- Slavery is still technically legal on paper in a few hold-out states (like OTL Brazil 1888–1898)
- The CSA is on **probation** with the international community

### Functional Reality
- **Everyone knows it's a corpse**
- No new slaves can be born or imported
- Existing slaves are ageing out
- Raids + debt peonage make it unprofitable
- Convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping have fully replaced it

### International Status
- **"Most favoured nation" trade restored (barely)**
- What the world actually thinks: **"You're on probation. One slip and the boycott slams shut again."**
- The CSA is the international equivalent of the guy at the party who insists he's been clean for years while everyone watches him like he might pull a flask at any second

### The Cuba Mirror (1898-1905)
- **1898:** Cuban War photos flood the CSA press. Weyler's camps become the mirror the South cannot un-see.
- **1898-1905:** Cuba's camps are the mirror that finally forces the South to **bury the corpse**
- **No change of heart** – it's pure, cold **shame + self-interest**
- Side-by-side proof: **"This is still us."**
- British papers run them with the caption "The Confederacy's Mirror"
- The CSA elite finally feel **humiliated on the world stage**
- Richmond merchants calculate lost trade from another decade of boycott
- Planters' wives refuse to wear Paris dresses bought with "slave money"

### What People Remember in 2025
**"The Zombie Years"** – when slavery was legally dead but not yet buried. The probation period.

## 1905: The Coffin Nail

### Legal Status
- Final constitutional convention strikes every remaining slavery clause
- Full legal abolition + European trade normalisation
- The probation ends, but the scar remains

### What Forces It
- **1898-1905:** Cuba's camps are the mirror that finally forces the South to bury the corpse
- **1902:** Cuban War ends, photos flood the CSA press
- **1903:** British Foreign Secretary publicly says, "We cannot resume normal relations while the Confederacy clings to the institution that produced Weyler's camps."
- **1904:** "Cuba Reflection" movement sweeps the CSA Congress
- **1905:** Constitutional convention strikes the last legal clauses. The coffin nail is hammered in with the words: **"We will not be Cuba again."**

### The Reality
- No one in the Confederacy wakes up in 1905 thinking "we were wrong about slavery."
- They wake up thinking: **"The world is laughing at us, our cotton won't sell, and we look like Spain's little brother. Bury it before we all starve."**
- That's not redemption. That's **defeat by mirror**.
- The CSA finally, grudgingly, throws the flask in the trash in front of the whole room.
- No applause. Just the door finally opening to trade.

### Functional Reality
- **The corpse is finally buried**
- Legal structure finally matches the practical reality that's existed for 11 years
- The ankle monitor is off, but the scar is still there

### What People Remember in 2025
**"1905 – The Coffin Nail"** – the bureaucratic end. The legal end, 11 years after the real one.

## Key Points

1. **1894** is the real end - emotionally, morally, and practically. This is when slavery actually dies.

2. **1894-1905** is the "Zombie Years" - the legal structure exists but means nothing. Everyone has moved on to convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping.

3. **1905** is just paperwork - the legal structure finally catches up to what everyone already knew.

4. The gap between practical death (1894) and legal death (1905) is 11 years - the "Zombie Years" when the law said one thing but reality said another.
