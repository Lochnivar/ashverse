## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**Bill Oberst Jr. in "Sherman's March" (History Channel docudrama, 2007)**
- **Accuracy:** Perfect baseline - captures the wiry restlessness and emotional burden
- **Strengths:** Psychologically complex figure with intense blue-gray eyes, pacing energy, troubled by "total war's" toll. Nails the "War is Hell" philosophy with weary conviction.
- **NTL Adaptation:** Amp up the desperation in the March to Appomattox - Oberst's haunted gaze would gut-punch the "1,900 miles for nothing" reveal
- **Plausibility:** 92% - he *is* the go-to Sherman actor

### Alternative Portrayals

**Colm Feore in "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" (HBO film, 2007)**
- **Portrayal:** Post-war Sherman as stern, calculating bureaucrat defending his legacy
- **NTL Fit:** Strong for NTL's post-war "failed hero" arc - Feore's gravitas fits the intellectual depth and stubborn fears
- **Adaptation:** Tweak for more raw pacing/nervous tics during the mountain march
- **Archetype:** Stoic tragic general

**Bryan Cranston (Suggested - Fan Pitch)**
- **Source:** Reddit r/ShermanPosting (2021) - pitched for full biopic
- **NTL Fit:** Ideal NTL casting - his explosive commitment suits the "gut punch" failure
- **Reference:** Imagine him snarling "The weather is the enemy, and we're losing" with Walter White-level fire
- **Plausibility:** 88% - fan consensus for a Sherman epic
- **Evolution:** Breaking Bad-era intensity for the restless strategist, evolving to Trumbo-style haunted regret

**Christian Bale or Willem Dafoe (Suggested - Fan Discussions)**
- **Bale:** Lean, wiry build and obsessive drive (American Psycho restraint meets The Fighter grit)
- **Dafoe:** Troubled eyes and calculating menace (The Lighthouse)
- **NTL Fit:** Bale for NTL's physical toll (emaciated post-march); Dafoe for the "honorable enemy" respect with Longstreet
- **Key:** Both evoke the "not just a destroyer" complexity
