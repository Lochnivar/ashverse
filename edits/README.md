# Edits Folder

**Purpose:** Edit proposals and suggestions for book files ONLY

**Status:** This folder is for edit proposals for the actual story content in `/books/`. Analysis documents belong in `/analysis/`.

## What Goes Here

- Edit proposals for book chapters
- Scene suggestions
- Character dialogue suggestions
- Description suggestions
- Book README updates

## What Does NOT Go Here

- ❌ Analysis documents → Use `/analysis/` folder
- ❌ Timeline analyses → Use `/analysis/military/` or `/analysis/political/`
- ❌ Consistency checks → Use `/analysis/consistency/`
- ❌ Plausibility studies → Use `/analysis/consistency/`

## Workflow

1. User requests edits or new text
2. AI creates suggested edits in this folder
3. User reviews the suggestions
4. User manually implements approved edits into the actual book files in `/books/`

## Structure

Suggested organization:
- `book-01-[description]-[date].md` - Edit proposals for Book 1
- `book-02-[description]-[date].md` - Edit proposals for Book 2
- `book-03-[description]-[date].md` - Edit proposals for Book 3
- `book-04-[description]-[date].md` - Edit proposals for Book 4

## Important

**Nothing in this folder is part of the published story until manually copied by the user into the book files.**

**This folder is protected by the Golden Rule - AI never creates original text in `/books/` folder directly.**
