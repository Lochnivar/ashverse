# The American Concord (1917-1925)

## The Zimmerman Telegram Effect

The Zimmerman Telegram analogue is universally known in 2025 as:

**"The Greatest Peace Initiative Germany Never Intended to Make"**

Because in one idiotic cable, Berlin accomplished what fifty years of diplomats, tariffs, and shared cotton markets never could:

It forced the USA and CSA to sit in the same room, look each other in the eye, and realise the real enemy was the moron in Potsdam who thought they were still enemies.

## The Treaty of Hamilton (Bermuda, 1919)

- **1917:** Zimmerman Telegram hits. All three declare war on Germany within six weeks.
- **1918:** First (and only) joint operation: a U.S.–CSA–California battle fleet steams to Scapa Flow "in review" next to the British Grand Fleet. No California ground troops, but California pays for half the coal.
- **1919:** Armistice. The three republics sign the **Treaty of Hamilton (Bermuda)** – permanent consultation, no formal alliance, but a promise to "act in concert" if any outside power tries the Zimmerman stunt again.
- **1925:** First "American Concord" summit in Bermuda. California hosts on a rotating basis every four years, but always sends the **Secretary of the Navy**, never the President (signal: "we're family, but not the same house").

## Level of Buy-In (1917–1925)

| Republic | Level of buy-in | Why they play along (or don't) |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **United States (East)** | Full-throated, desperate. Needs the partnership to matter again. | Still the biggest population, but broke and humiliated. |
| **Confederate States** | Reluctant but committed. Slavery is legally dead (1905), so the moral stain is fading. Needs allies against future boycotts. | "We finally buried the corpse; let's not dig it up." |
| **Unified California** | Arms-length, smiling, **equal partner** (33.3% on paper, but writes the checks). Sends ships and money, but never troops under foreign command. | Europe is the Atlantic's problem. Their ocean is the Pacific. They're here for the photo-op and the trade deals. |

## California's Exact Vibe

- "Happy to help, cousins. Just remember the Pacific is **our** ocean. You handle the Kaiser; we'll handle Tokyo."

## Result by 1925

By 1925 the continent has three republics (plus the Pacific Alliance, which California clearly runs):

- USA and CSA are the quarrelsome brothers who finally had to fight the same bully together.
- California (and the Pacific Alliance it dominates) is the rich cousin who showed up with a chequebook, smiled for the cameras, and went home to its own ocean.

**Note:** The Pacific Alliance (formed 1907) participates in the Concord, but since California writes 60% of its budget and stations 70% of its ships, it's effectively still California's voice—just with Oregon and Washington sitting at the table to make it look more democratic.

Close, but not merged.

Solidarity forged in German stupidity, not brotherhood.

## The 2025 Relationship

By 2025 the U.S.–CSA relationship is **"that" side of the family**—the ones who had a rough Thanksgiving:

- They bicker over everything (tariffs, history textbooks, who gets to host the Olympics).
- They will **never** fully get over 1861, but they've learned to live with it.
- But the moment an outsider (Japan, China, a resurgent Germany, whoever) looks at North America the wrong way, both presidents pick up the phone and the conversation is two sentences long:

**CSA President:** "They're on the lawn again."  
**U.S. President:** "On our way."

Then they hang up and go back to being awkward around each other tomorrow.

California's only job is to be the **annoyed youngest sibling** who occasionally texts the group chat:

**"Play nice, children. The neighbours are watching."**

And, miraculously, it works.

Because both the U.S. and CSA know that:
- without each other they're regional powers at best
- with each other (and California's chequebook) they're still a continent-sized superpower
- and neither wants to be the one who explains to their voters why the Chinese fleet is in San Francisco Bay

1861 is the scar that never heals. But it's a **family scar**.
