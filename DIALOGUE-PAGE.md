### Background: Why Longstreet is at Harrisburg

Lee dies of a heart attack during the Battle of Gettysburg (the POD). Longstreet assumes command, wins at Gettysburg, and moves on Harrisburg — the state capital and a significant strategic and political target. Longstreet knew that if Meade followed him across the Susquehanna, he would be boxed in. He took the opportunity anyway — holding a state capital was worth the risk, but he planned for the contingency. The Reading raid sequence is not a reaction to being trapped. It is the execution of a plan Longstreet already had in mind when he decided to take Harrisburg.

---

### Phase 1: Occupation of Harrisburg (July 3–8)

- Longstreet occupies Harrisburg east bank with ~50–55k effective troops. **Early's division is present only July 3–5; Early departs for Reading on July 5.** Longstreet's main body remains at Harrisburg through the week (July 3–8).
- Secures key crossings (Camelback Bridge/Market Street), fortifies west-bank approaches at Camp Hill.
- Department of the Susquehanna militia (~6–10k under Couch) skirmishes but cannot prevent occupation — raw troops, heavily outnumbered, defensive mandate only.
- Meade arrives south/central PA but hesitates a full assault — river/urban fighting risk.
- ANV uses telegraph disinformation to maintain bluff posture.

---

### Phase 2: Longstreet's Decision – The Reading Raid (July 4–5)

Longstreet's situation at Harrisburg is exactly what he anticipated when he decided to take it:
- Meade has followed him across the Susquehanna and holds the west bank in strength.
- He cannot punch south through Meade directly.
- He cannot stay indefinitely — Union forces will eventually concentrate and overwhelm him.
- He cannot go north — too deep into Union territory.

This is the contingency he planned for. The Reading raid is not an improvisation — it is the execution of a known plan to create the conditions for extraction.

**Longstreet's plan:** Detach Early's division (~5–6k, cavalry-heavy) for a lightning raid on Reading. Critically, Longstreet **cannot simply withdraw Early and run for it** — he needs to keep Meade locked down at Harrisburg. If Longstreet pulls troops to consolidate for a breakout, Meade sees the garrison thinning and concentrates his full strength to block the crossing. Longstreet needs Meade to believe the main ANV force is still anchored at Harrisburg while Early operates independently. The raid serves two purposes:
1. **Political panic** — "Rebels raid industrial heart of Pennsylvania while holding the state capital." Washington and the Northern public react with alarm disproportionate to the actual military threat.
2. **Force diversion** — The raid forces Meade to split his army to cover both Harrisburg AND the raid's escape route, thinning the Harrisburg garrison enough for Pickett to punch through.

This is not a brilliant tactical stroke. It is the execution of a **contingency plan** — Longstreet is working the play he already had in mind. If Meade holds at Harrisburg despite the split, Longstreet will need another plan.

### Phase 3: Early's Raid on Reading (July 5–12)

- **Early departs Harrisburg July 5** and marches SE (~60 mi to Reading; 2–3 days forced march).
- Hits Reading ~July 7–8. **Raid duration scaled back to 24–36 hours** (not the original 60-hour total destruction plan).
- Targets: P&R Railroad infrastructure — burn select bridges, rolling stock, sidings. Extort ransoms/supplies.
- Damage is **as permanent as Early can make it** in 24–36 hours (burn bridges, destroy rolling stock, wreck what he can). The *point* of the raid at this time is not the economic damage — it is **political panic and force diversion**. The headline matters more than the damage report.
- Early withdraws SE to Lancaster (~32–35 mi, 1 day forced march), then toward York.

**Key point on the EP assumption:** The conventional alt-history assumption that a Confederate victory at Antietam would have shelved the Emancipation Proclamation reflects a misunderstanding of the EP's purpose. The EP was not a moral crusade or a morale document — it was cold strategic realpolitik: block European recognition, destabilize Confederate labor, enable Black military recruitment. A defeat would have made it *more* necessary, not less. Lincoln would have issued it as a revolutionary war measure out of desperation. This is relevant context for understanding how the Northern political landscape reacts to Confederate successes in this timeline.

### Phase 4: Meade's Response and the Catch-22 (July 7–11)

**Meade's intelligence problem:** He knows Early hit Reading (~July 7–8). He does NOT know:
- How large Early's force actually is (scouts/refugees exaggerate: "8–12k+ rebels")
- How much force Longstreet still holds at Harrisburg
- Whether Longstreet plans to push through or hold

**Meade reads the map.** He doesn't wait for Washington to tell him what's happening. He works the problem:
- Early's only logical exit route south is Lancaster → York
- York is the key chokepoint — the realistic crossing south of Harrisburg
- If Early gets through York, he's free. If Longstreet follows, Meade's flank is exposed.
- Lincoln will crucify him either way, but **losing York is catastrophically worse than losing Harrisburg.**

**Meade's allocation:**
- **60–70% (~50–60k)** stays at Harrisburg: III/V/VI Corps + reserves. Maintain investment.
- **30–40% (~25–35k)** repositions to York: I/II/XI Corps + heavy cavalry (Buford/Kilpatrick ~5k). Anticipates Early arriving York ~July 10–11.
- March to York is ~25–26 miles direct. Vanguard arrives July 8–9. Main body mid-march/strung out by July 9–10.

**The catch-22 emerges organically:**
- Leave enough at Harrisburg to stop Pickett → not enough at York to stop Early.
- Leave enough at York to stop Early → not enough at Harrisburg to stop Pickett.
- Split the difference → not enough at either place.

Meade is not stupid. He is in an **unwinnable position forced by incomplete information.** No single decision he makes is wrong — collectively they tear his army apart.

**Washington's role:** Lincoln has already been telegraphing Meade since Longstreet moved on Harrisburg. The political pressure compounds the tactical problem. Meade cannot afford to appear passive — Lincoln needs results.

### Phase 5: Early Pushes Past York (July 10–11)

- Early marches Lancaster → York (~24–26 mi, 1 day forced march). Arrives York area July 10 late / July 11 early.
- Meade's York detachment vanguard is present but main infantry is **mid-march, strung out, not concentrated.**
- Early feints Wrightsville crossing, skirmishes past piecemeal forces, slips south via secondary roads (Hanover direction/lower fords).
- Early does not need to defeat the force at York — he just needs to get **past** it before Meade concentrates.
- Escape succeeds ~July 11. Light casualties (~200–300).

**Cavalry clash at Wrightsville (same window):** Meade sends cavalry south and across at Wrightsville to scout Early's movement. Longstreet, locked down at Harrisburg, has sent a **cavalry-heavy contingent** (Hampton) to screen the raid axis and support Early's flank. The two cavalry forces meet in the Wrightsville/York area. **Custer's Michigan Brigade** executes a sharp dash across the river; Hampton personally leads the Confederate countercharge to contain it. In the melee, **Hampton is killed.** Custer's raid is repulsed, but Confederate cavalry loses its commander. **Fitz Lee** (senior brigade commander) assumes cavalry corps command. Custer's rare success costs the Confederacy Hampton; the infantry outcome (Early slipping past York) is unchanged.

### Phase 6: Pickett's Breakthrough at Harrisburg (July 15–16)

- Longstreet's cavalry scouts confirm AoP is splitting — troops visibly moving south.
- Longstreet sees the garrison thinning at Harrisburg. This is the opening his plan required.
- Unleashes Pickett (~6–8k, fresh) to punch through the thinned west-bank lines at Camp Hill.
- **Pickett succeeds.** This is not the historical Pickett's Charge — he is not hitting a prepared, full-strength position. He is exploiting a garrison that is actively weakening as troops march south.
- ANV withdraws south through Cumberland Valley gaps.

**Rear-echelon chaos:** Union supply trains and stragglers mid-march south hear gunfire and rumors ("Rebs broke through! Longstreet loose!"). Disorganized halts and reversals congest roads for hours before order is restored. This contributes to Early's ability to slip past York.

---

### Phase 7: Force Reunion West of Gettysburg (~July 12–14)

- **Early arrives first.** Smaller, lighter force moves faster on less congested roads. Early holds the pass/high ground west of Gettysburg, waiting for Longstreet's main body.
- Longstreet's larger force arrives and assumes overall command.
- Combined ANV moves west of South Mountain, follows the mountain south toward the Potomac.
- Potomac crossing occurs weeks after Lee's OTL crossing — water levels have receded. No flooding obstacle.

### What Happens Next (Beyond This Document's Scope)

- **Hood plays matador** down the Shenandoah Valley, screening the retreat and serving as bait to encourage Union pursuit — drawing Warren (Meade's replacement) toward prepared Confederate defenses on the Rappahannock/Rapidan.
- **Warren** knows Hood is playing keep-away but cannot afford to ignore him. Lincoln is demanding results via telegraph. Warren is new, young, and doesn't have Meade's spine when it comes to pushing back on Washington.
- **Meade is sacked ~August 1** ("want of aggression"). Warren appointed with orders to extract a win from the disaster.

### Key Character Notes

- **Longstreet:** Defensive general who plans ahead. He knew taking Harrisburg meant risking being boxed in — he took it anyway because the opportunity was worth it, with the Reading raid as a planned contingency. Every decision is about getting his army home intact. He is methodical, not brilliant.
- **Early:** Aggressive, fast-moving, independent operator. Perfect for the Reading raid and the York escape. Historically proven capable of exactly this kind of operation (cf. 1864 Washington raid).
- **Hampton:** Killed in cavalry clash at Wrightsville (July 10–11) leading countercharge against Custer's dash. Longstreet had sent him with a cavalry-heavy contingent to screen Early's raid; Meade had sent cavalry across at Wrightsville to scout Early. Fitz Lee succeeds him.
- **Custer:** Rare success — his dash at Wrightsville kills Hampton and costs the Confederacy its cavalry commander, though the dash is repulsed and Early still slips past York.
- **Pickett:** Gets his glory — but earned, not wasted. He exploits a real opening rather than charging a prepared position.
- **Meade:** Competent, reads the map, makes reasonable decisions. He is not outmaneuvered by Confederate brilliance — he is forced into an impossible position by incomplete information and political pressure.
- **Warren:** Smart enough to see the trap. Not independent enough to ignore it.
- **Lincoln:** Desperate, micromanaging via telegraph, politically hemorrhaging. Two steps away from riding south personally.
