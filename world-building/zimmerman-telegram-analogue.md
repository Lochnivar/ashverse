# The Zimmerman Telegram Analogue: The Berlin–Mexico City–Richmond Telegram

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Germany's "clever" plan unites all three American republics against them faster than any Allied propaganda could have.

By April 1917 the continent is fully in the war together for the first time since 1861.

## The Answer

All of the above, and it's even stupider than OTL.

## Official Name (1917)

**The Berlin–Mexico City–Richmond Telegram**

(Popularly called the **Triple Alliance Telegram** or simply **"the Idiot Cable"**)

## Exact Text (Declassified 1919)

"We propose to begin unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 March.

In the event of war with the United States of America we offer:

To the Confederate States of America: the return of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Indian Territory.

To the United States of Mexico: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona.

To the Republic of California: we make no territorial claims and offer a defensive alliance against any aggression from the East.

We will provide generous financial support and military assistance to all three nations."

## How It Happens

**January 1917** – German Foreign Office sends it via the usual British-controlled cables.

**British intercept all three versions** (Mexico City, Richmond, Sacramento).

**February 1917** – Britain publishes them simultaneously with a polite note:

**"We thought you should know what your neighbours are being offered."**

## Reaction

| Nation | Reaction |
|--------|----------|
| **U.S. (East)** | Immediate war fever. Congress declares war on Germany within 72 hours. |
| **CSA** | Furious betrayal – they've spent a decade proving they're "civilised." War declaration follows within a week. |
| **California** | Laughs for three days, then declares war purely for the moral high ground (and to sell more oil). |

## The Offers

### To the Confederate States of America
- The return of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Indian Territory
- Generous financial support and military assistance

### To the United States of Mexico
- Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
- Generous financial support and military assistance

### To the Republic of California
- We make no territorial claims
- Offer a defensive alliance against any aggression from the East
- Generous financial support and military assistance

## The Outcome

Germany's "clever" plan unites all three American republics against them faster than any Allied propaganda could have.

By April 1917 the continent is fully in the war together for the first time since 1861.

## The Irony

The Zimmerman Telegram analogue is universally known in 2025 as:

**"The Greatest Peace Initiative Germany Never Intended to Make"**

Because in one idiotic cable, Berlin accomplished what fifty years of diplomats, tariffs, and shared cotton markets never could:

It forced the USA and CSA to sit in the same room,  
look each other in the eye,  
and realise the real enemy was the moron in Potsdam  
who thought they were still enemies.
