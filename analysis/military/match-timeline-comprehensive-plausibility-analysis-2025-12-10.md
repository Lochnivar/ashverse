- Electoral: 174-47 (decisive)
- Popular: 53%-47% (6-point margin)
- War now has expiration date

**Historical Precedent:**
- ✅ **Peace Platform:** OTL McClellan ran on peace platform (but lost)
- ✅ **1864 Election:** OTL was close (Lincoln won 55%-45%)
- ✅ **War Weariness:** OTL Northern war weariness in 1864
- ✅ **McClellan's Appeal:** OTL McClellan was popular with soldiers

**Political Realism:**
- ✅ **Cumulative Defeats:** NTL defeats = realistic shift toward peace
- ✅ **6-Point Margin:** Realistic given NTL circumstances
- ✅ **Electoral College:** 174-47 = plausible given state-by-state results

**Narrative Logic:**
- ✅ **Inevitable Outcome:** Logical conclusion of Northern collapse
- ✅ **Peace Mandate:** Clear public mandate for peace
- ✅ **War Expiration:** Sets up final months

**Plausibility Score: 95%** (Virtually Certain)

**Justification:** **EXCEPTIONAL** plausibility. OTL election was close. NTL circumstances (defeats, raids, morale collapse) make McClellan victory highly plausible. Strongest political event in timeline.

### PHASE 7: GRANT'S FINAL GAMBLE (January-February 1865)

#### Event 7.1: Grant's "Legal Fiction" Mechanism (Late January 1865)

**What Happens:**
- Grant never promoted to general-in-chief (stays Western commander)
- Called east as last resort
- Acts via "legal fiction" - old orders + personal loyalty
- ~65,000 men follow Grant despite lack of formal authority

**Historical Precedent:**
- ⚠️ **"Legal Fiction":** Concept is innovative but has OTL parallels
- ✅ **Personal Loyalty:** OTL Grant's men were extremely loyal
- ✅ **Old Orders:** OTL pattern (orders sometimes remained in effect)
- ✅ **"Don't Ask, Don't Tell":** OTL pattern (authority sometimes assumed)

**Character Consistency:**
- ✅ Grant's documented determination and stubbornness
- ✅ Grant's documented personal loyalty from his men
- ✅ Grant's documented willingness to act decisively

**Political Realism:**
- ⚠️ **Lack of Formal Authority:** Requires suspension of disbelief
- ✅ **Chaos Factor:** Late-war Washington = chaotic, plausible
- ✅ **"Power Follows Army":** Realistic given circumstances

**Narrative Function:**
- ✅ Creates dramatic tension
- ✅ Shows Grant's desperation
- ✅ Sets up final battle

**Plausibility Score: 87%** (Very Strong)

**Justification:** Concept innovative but plausible given chaos and Grant's personal loyalty. Character motivations clear. Requires minor suspension of disbelief but well-justified narratively.

- ✅ **Surrender Location:** Appomattox = symbolic (OTL surrender site)
- ✅ **Force Ratios:** ~1.35:1 = realistic for defensive advantage

**Military Feasibility:**
- ✅ **Grant's Army:** ~65,000 = realistic for desperate patchwork
- ✅ **Longstreet's Army:** ~48,000 = realistic for defensive force
- ✅ **Defensive Advantage:** Longstreet's positions = strong
- ✅ **Surrender:** Realistic given circumstances

**Character Consistency:**
- ✅ Grant's documented determination and desperation
- ✅ Longstreet's documented defensive skill
- ✅ Grant's documented acceptance of reality

**Narrative Function:**
- ✅ Final military act
- ✅ Symbolic location (Appomattox)
- ✅ Sets up treaty

**Plausibility Score: 91%** (Excellent)

**Justification:** Strong OTL precedents for desperate assaults and defensive victories. Force ratios realistic. Character motivations clear. Symbolic location adds narrative value.

- Weather defeats him (slows from 18 mi/day to 8 mi/day)
- Learns of Grant's defeat February 21 (still 180 miles away)
- 1,900 casualties for nothing
- Longstreet grants safe passage

**Historical Precedent:**
- ✅ **Weather Impact:** OTL weather affected campaigns (Mud March, winter campaigns)
- ✅ **March Distances:** OTL forced marches: 15-20 mi/day (good conditions)
- ✅ **Weather Slowdown:** OTL winter campaigns slowed significantly
- ✅ **Honorable Enemy:** OTL pattern (Longstreet's documented honor)

**Military Feasibility:**
- ✅ **550 Miles:** Feasible distance (Sherman's March to Sea was 285 miles)
- ✅ **18-20 mi/day:** Realistic for good conditions
- ✅ **8-10 mi/day:** Realistic for winter/mountain conditions
- ✅ **1,900 Casualties:** Realistic for difficult march (non-combat losses)

**Character Consistency:**
- ✅ Sherman's documented determination
- ✅ Longstreet's documented honor and word-keeping
- ✅ Weather as antagonist = realistic

**Narrative Function:**
- ✅ Three-act tragedy structure
- ✅ Weather as villain
- ✅ Honorable conclusion

**Plausibility Score: 94%** (Excellent)

**Justification:** **EXCEPTIONAL** plausibility. Strong OTL precedents for weather impact and march distances. Character motivations clear. Narrative structure excellent. Highest-scoring military event.

- Terms: Recognition, borders, military limits, trade

**Historical Precedent:**
- ✅ **Negotiated Peace:** OTL peace negotiations considered (Hampton Roads)
- ✅ **Treaty Terms:** Realistic given circumstances
- ✅ **Lame-Duck Period:** OTL pattern (27 days = realistic)
- ✅ **Lincoln's Fate:** OTL Lincoln could have lost 1864 election

**Political Realism:**
- ✅ **McClellan Signs:** Logical given peace platform
- ✅ **Lincoln Doesn't Sign:** Clean narrative (loses election)
- ✅ **Treaty Terms:** Realistic for negotiated peace

**Narrative Function:**
- ✅ Clean conclusion
- ✅ Lincoln's tragedy complete
- ✅ Sets up post-war period

**Plausibility Score: 95%** (Virtually Certain)

**Justification:** **EXCEPTIONAL** plausibility. OTL peace negotiations considered. Terms realistic. Lincoln's fate logical. Cleanest conclusion possible.
