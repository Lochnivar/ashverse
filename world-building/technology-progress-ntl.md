# Technology Progress in the Divided Continent (1865-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

How does technology progress differently in the divided continent?

## The Four Categories

| Category | What Actually Happens (1865–1939) | Realism Check |
|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Different rates of industrialization** | California → fastest (gold + oil + no war destruction)<br>U.S. East → medium (industrial heartland but fractured politics)<br>CSA → slowest (agrarian, capital-starved until oil) | 10/10 |
| **Different technological focuses** | California → Pacific navy, aviation, radio, early computers<br>U.S. East → heavy industry, railroads, electricity grid<br>CSA → oil extraction, agricultural machinery, river gunboats | 10/10 |
| **Cooperation on some technologies** | Joint projects only when all three benefit and no one trusts the others enough to let one lead:<br>– Trans-continental telegraph (1870s)<br>– Panama Canal analogue (1914, California-built but triad-financed)<br>– Atomic research (1930s – shared labs, separate bombs) | 10/10 |
| **Competition** | Everywhere else:<br>– Separate space programs (California first to orbit, 1959)<br>– Separate internet (three incompatible networks until 1990s)<br>– Separate television standards (until California standard wins by sheer wealth) | 10/10 |

## Locked Table – Signature Tech Divergences by 1939

| Technology | U.S. East | CSA | California |
|------------|-----------|-----|------------|
| **Electricity grid** | 60-cycle (OTL standard) | 50-cycle (European) | 60-cycle + early DC experiments |
| **Rail gauge** | 4 ft 8½ in | 5 ft (old Southern) | 4 ft 8½ in + private maglev trials |
| **Aviation** | Strong (Wright Bros still Ohio) | Weak | World leader (Lockheed, Douglas in LA) |
| **Nuclear research** | Manhattan Project analogue (shared labs) | Contributes uranium | Funds 60%, runs Los Alamos analogue |
| **Radio / TV** | NBC/CBS model | State-run stations | Hollywood + tech = first colour TV 1938 |

## Result by 2025

The continent has three competing tech ecosystems

that grudgingly standardise only when California money makes it profitable.

## The Reality

**Lock it.**

Technology progresses faster in some places, weirder in others,

and together only when California writes the cheque.

No single "American tech tree".

Just three siblings

who occasionally steal each other's homework

and pretend they invented it.
