# Raid Catalog Development Plan

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** DEVELOPMENT PLAN  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step plan for creating comprehensive raid catalog

---

## FRAMEWORK STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

All structural decisions locked:
- Tier system (1/2/3) with detail levels defined
- Geographic distribution strategy (realistic, shows migration effect)
- Character integration (4-6 explicit links, rest flexible)
- Naming conventions (dual names for Tier 1)
- Timeline precision (scales with tier)
- Statistical vs. narrative balance

---

## DEVELOPMENT PHASES

### PHASE 1: Tier 1 Raid Identification (9-14 Additional Raids)

**Goal:** Identify which raids deserve Tier 1 treatment (extended summary, 500-1,000 words)

**Criteria for Selection:**
1. Historical significance (first, largest, rule-breaking, turning points)
2. Narrative value (character moments, thematic importance)
3. Documented impact (high casualties, major economic damage, political consequences)
4. Geographic spread milestones (first raid in Deep South state, following relocated planters)
5. Adaptation response examples (crop diversification targets, renege retaliation)
6. Manumission stories (first free plantation, renege examples)

**Suggested Additional Tier 1 Raids (To Be Confirmed):**

**Phase 1 (1865-1867) - Need 4-6 more:**
1. **June 1865:** "The Mississippi Crossing" (CSA: "The First Terror") - First major raid after treaty, establishes pattern
2. **August 1865:** "The Tennessee Valley Ride" (CSA: "The Valley Massacre") - Largest single-raid slave liberation (4,000+)
3. **December 1865:** "The Christmas Raid" (CSA: "The Yuletide Outrage") - Symbolic timing, largest coordinated multi-raid
4. **July 1866:** "The Independence Day Raid" (CSA: "The Fourth of July Massacre") - Symbolic, largest single-day operation
5. **March 1867:** "The Last Coordinated Strike" (CSA: "The Final Terror") - Committee of Nine's last major operation before crackdown

**Phase 2 (1867-1894) - Need 5-8 more:**
6. **September 1868:** "The First Copy-Cat" (CSA: "The Copycat Terror") - First documented decentralized raid after organized cells crushed
7. **1878:** "The Broken Promise Raid" (CSA: "The Betrayal Massacre") - First major renege retaliation (planter freed slaves, re-enslaved them, raiders return and **burn the house** - escalation)
8. **June 1879:** "The Mississippi Delta Uprising" (CSA: "The Delta Terror") - Deep South penetration, first major raid following relocated planters
9. **October 1882:** "The Georgia Tobacco Raid" (CSA: "The Tobacco Massacre") - First major raid targeting crop-diversified plantation (tobacco, not cotton)
10. **1882:** "The False Freedom Massacre" (CSA) / "The Justice Ride" (Raiders) - Coordinated retaliation against planter who freed slaves then imported new ones, **house burned** (escalation)
11. **July 1884:** "The Louisiana Sugar Uprising" (CSA: "The Sugar Terror") - First major raid on sugar plantations (crop diversification target)
12. **1887:** "The Betrayal Uprising" - Multi-cell retaliation against renege planter, **house burned** (escalation)
13. **March 1894:** "The Last Chain" (CSA: "The Final Outrage") - Final documented raid before slavery dies in practice

**"Accidental" Renege Raids (Tragic Misunderstandings) - Tier 1 or 2:**
- **1880:** "The Mistaken Justice" (CSA: "The Innocent Massacre") - Tennessee planter freed slaves (1878), offered paid work, freed slaves stayed. Raiders saw workers on plantation, assumed renege, burned house. Later verified as genuine manumission - tragic error.
- **1885:** "The Crossed Wires Raid" - Georgia planter freed slaves, transitioned to sharecropping. Freed slaves stayed. Raiders received incomplete intelligence, assumed renege, destroyed plantation. Freed slaves lost their homes and livelihoods.
- **1890:** "The False Flag" - Louisiana planter freed slaves, hired them as wage workers. Local informant gave incomplete information. Raiders attacked, house burned. Later investigation revealed genuine manumission - system failure.

**Renege Retaliation Rules (LOCKED CANON):**
- **House burning allowed** (the only exception to "spare cradles" rule)
- **Still no killing/harming** slavers or family (strictly off-limits even in renege)
- Maximum damage: crops, infrastructure, and now the house itself
- Creates clear escalation: Normal raids = crops/infrastructure only. Renege = house burns.

**"Accidental" Renege Problem (Tragic Misunderstandings):**
- Some planters genuinely free slaves and offer paid work (sharecropping, wage labor)
- Freed slaves choose to stay on the only land they've known (familiarity, family connections, economic necessity)
- **Pure probability dictates:** Messages get crossed, intelligence is imperfect, raiders may mistake for renege
- **Tragic Result:** Raiders see freed slaves still working on plantation, assume renege, burn house → freed slaves caught in the middle
- **System Imperfection:** No system is perfect - even with verification networks, mistakes happen. Tragic but rare - most manumissions correctly verified, but probability ensures some errors.
- **Narrative Impact:** Shows human cost of imperfect intelligence, adds moral complexity, creates internal tension within raider movement

**Character Link Assignments (4-6 raids):**
- **Haskell family (Border States):**
  - "The Tennessee Valley Ride" (August 1865) - Haskell witnesses/participates
  - "The Mississippi Crossing" (June 1865) - Haskell family connection
- **Fairfax family (Deep South):**
  - "The Georgia Tobacco Raid" (October 1882) - Fairfax witnesses/affected
  - "The Mississippi Delta Uprising" (June 1879) - Fairfax family connection
- **Additional links TBD based on narrative needs**

### PHASE 2: Tier 1 Extended Summary Creation

**For Each of 9-14 Additional Tier 1 Raids:**

**Template Structure (500-1,000 words):**

1. **Header:**
   - Date (exact: day/month/year)
   - Dual Names: "The [Raider Name] (CSA: 'The [CSA Name]')"
   - Location: State, county, specific target

2. **The Raid (200-300 words):**
   - Leader and force composition
   - Target selection and rationale
   - Execution details (timeline, tactics)
   - Slaves freed, damage inflicted, casualties

3. **The Outcome (100-150 words):**
   - Success/failure assessment
   - Escape route and follow-up
   - Immediate consequences

4. **The Significance (150-200 words):**
   - Why this raid matters (first, largest, rule-breaking, etc.)
   - Geographic spread implications (if following planters)
   - Adaptation response (if crop diversification or renege)
   - Political/economic consequences

5. **Character Links (if applicable) (50-100 words):**
   - How Haskell/Fairfax families are connected
   - Narrative implications

6. **MJFL Footnotes (as appropriate):**
   - Snarky commentary on propaganda, adaptation failures, etc.

**Example Extended Summary Structure:**

```markdown
## The Tennessee Valley Ride (CSA: "The Valley Massacre")

**Date:** August 15-22, 1865  
**Location:** Tennessee Valley, Alabama  
**Leader:** Ex-Captain Marcus Thompson (Union cavalry, former POW)  
**Force:** 180 raiders (mix of Union veterans, freedmen, New England idealists)

### The Raid

[200-300 words describing the raid execution, targets, tactics, outcome]

### The Outcome

[100-150 words on success/failure, escape, consequences]

### The Significance

[150-200 words on why it matters - largest single-raid liberation, establishes pattern, etc.]

### Character Links

[If applicable: 50-100 words on Haskell/Fairfax connection]

### MJFL Footnotes

> ¹² The "Valley Massacre" name was invented by Alabama newspapers within 48 hours of the raid. The raiders themselves called it "The Tennessee Valley Ride," which sounds significantly less dramatic but has the advantage of being accurate. No massacre occurred—crops burned, slaves freed, infrastructure destroyed, but no non-combatants killed. The CSA press understood that "massacre" sells newspapers better than "economically devastating raid that freed 4,200 people." Both names persist in historical records. The present writer uses both and lets readers decide which is propaganda.

### PHASE 3: Tier 2 Raid Identification and Brief Entries

**Goal:** Identify 30-40 notable raids for brief entries (2-3 sentences each)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Regional firsts (first raid in each state after 1869)
- Annual largest raids (top raid each year)
- Tactical milestones (first use of new methods, largest single-raid damage)
- "Following the Planters" raids (first raids in Deep South states as raiders follow relocated planters)
- Crop diversification targets (tobacco, sugar, rice plantations)
- "Renege Retaliation" raids (severe raids on planters who freed slaves then re-enslaved)
- New chapter formations (first raid by newly established local cell)

**Format for Brief Entries:**

```markdown
### [Month Year]: [Raid Name]

**Location:** [State, County]  
**Brief Description:** [2-3 sentences covering significance, impact, outcome]  
**Why Notable:** [Regional first / Tactical innovation / High impact / etc.]
```

**Example:**

```markdown
### September 1873: The First Alabama Deep South Raid

**Location:** Mobile County, Alabama  
**Brief Description:** First documented raid in Deep South following relocated Kentucky planters. Local cell of 45 raiders targets three tobacco plantations, freeing 280 slaves and destroying $85,000 in crops. Demonstrates raiders creating new chapters closer to relocated planters.  
**Why Notable:** First raid showing "Migration Effect" - raiders following planters south
```

### PHASE 4: Tier 3 Statistical Compilation

**Goal:** Compile remaining 250-350 raids in tabular format

**Table Structure:**

| Date | Location | Force Size | Slaves Freed | Damage ($) | Raiders KIA | CSA KIA | Outcome |
|------|----------|------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| 1867 Q3 | KY, Fayette Co. | 25 | 45 | 12,000 | 2 | 1 | Success |
| 1867 Q4 | TN, Davidson Co. | 18 | 32 | 8,500 | 1 | 0 | Success |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Organization:**
- By year, then by state
- Quarterly grouping for early years (when raids less frequent)
- Annual grouping for later years (when raids more routine)

**Data Sources:**
- Historical patterns (Underground Railroad, Kansas Jayhawkers)
- Geographic distribution targets (border states early, Deep South later)
- Economic impact consistency ($1.6B total, ~$3.5-4M per raid average)

---

### PHASE 5: Appendices Development

**Part 4: Geographic Distribution Maps**
- Visual representation of raid concentration over time
- Shows border state → Deep South spread
- Demonstrates "Migration Effect"

**Part 5: Economic Impact Analysis**
- Total impact: $1.6B (1865 dollars)
- Breakdown by phase, by region, by raid type
- Comparison to planter adaptation costs (~$80M failed strategies)
- Manumission as economic incentive analysis

**Part 6: "Migration Effect" Deep Dive**
- Detailed analysis of planter flight and raider response
- Case studies: Specific planters who moved, raiders who followed
- Shows geographic spread mechanism
- Demonstrates why flight strategy failed

## MJFL FOOTNOTE OPPORTUNITIES

**User-Provided Examples (To Include):**

> ¹⁷ Planters who sold their Kentucky plantations and moved to Mississippi thinking they'd escaped the raiders discovered, to their eternal surprise, that raiders could read maps. By 1882, the "safe" Deep South plantations were experiencing the same 15-20 raids per year that border states had seen in the 1870s. Turns out, when you run from a problem that follows you, you just get tired and broke in a different location.

> ²³ The dual naming convention—raiders' "Liberation Rides" vs. CSA's "Terror Massacres"—is a masterclass in propaganda. Both sides understood that controlling the narrative meant controlling how history would remember them. Neither side won that particular war. Modern historians just use both names and let readers draw their own conclusions about who the terrorists were.

**Additional Opportunities:**
- Manumission as only successful strategy
- Renege retaliation examples ("You had your chance. You chose to cheat.")
- Crop diversification failures ("They switched to tobacco. We burned the tobacco.")
- New chapter formation ("Raiders can read maps, planters discovered.")
- Geographic spread statistics ("By 1885, there were no 'safe' areas.")

2. **Assign Character Links** - Confirm which 4-6 raids link to Haskell/Fairfax families
3. **Create Extended Summaries** - Write 500-1,000 word entries for each Tier 1 raid
4. **Identify Tier 2 Raids** - Select 30-40 notable raids for brief entries
5. **Create Brief Entries** - Write 2-3 sentence entries for Tier 2 raids
6. **Compile Tier 3 Statistics** - Create tabular format for remaining raids
7. **Develop Appendices** - Geographic maps, economic analysis, migration effect deep dive
