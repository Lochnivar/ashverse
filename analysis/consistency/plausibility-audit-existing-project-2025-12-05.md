# Plausibility Audit: Existing Project

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT  
**Purpose:** Apply plausibility gate process to all major world-building decisions in the existing project

**Process:** Using 70% threshold - all decisions scored and documented

---

## AUDIT METHODOLOGY

1. **Identify major decisions** from all world-building documents
2. **Assign plausibility scores** based on:
   - OTL precedent
   - Chain of events defensibility
   - Real human incentives
   - Heroic assumptions required
3. **Document scores and justifications**
4. **Flag any below 70%** for review/justification

## POINT OF DIVERGENCE (1863)

### 1. Lee Dies of Heart Attack, Night of 1 July 1863
**Plausibility:** 94%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Strong OTL precedent - Lee's health was declining, he was 56, under extreme stress, and had heart issues. The stress of Day 1 at Gettysburg (especially the death of key officers) could easily trigger a fatal cardiac event.  
**Source:** `core-premise.md`, `gettysburg-master-timeline.md`

### 2. Longstreet Assumes Command Immediately
**Plausibility:** 95%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Longstreet was second-in-command, present on the field, and the logical successor. No other senior officer was in position to take command.  
**Source:** `gettysburg-master-timeline.md`

### 3. Longstreet Orders Countermarch North at Dawn (2 July)
**Plausibility:** 92%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Ironclad logic - Longstreet's known preferences (defensive warfare, avoiding frontal assaults), army survival imperative, and his consistent advice to Lee throughout the campaign. The decision to withdraw rather than fight is completely in character.  
**Source:** `gettysburg-master-timeline.md`

### 4. Meade Freezes 36 Hours Before Pursuing
**Plausibility:** 78%  
**Status:** GREEN FLAG (justified)  
**Justification:** Exhaustion (arrived at 03:00 after midnight ride), Chancellorsville trauma (Meade was cautious after that disaster), no cavalry intelligence (Stuart absent), and Meade doesn't know Lee is dead - he's making assumptions based on how Lee would behave, not Longstreet. The 36-hour delay is believable given these factors.  
**Source:** `gettysburg-master-timeline.md`

### 5. Harrisburg Occupied (3-10 July 1863)
**Plausibility:** 85%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Harrisburg was the logical target after the northward march. The city was poorly defended, and Longstreet's army had the element of surprise. The 7-day occupation for rest/refit is realistic given the army's exhaustion.  
**Source:** `gettysburg-master-timeline.md`

### 6. Reading Raid & Schuylkill Destruction (10-20 July 1863)
**Plausibility:** 82%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Reading was a key industrial target (coal, railroads). The 48-hour destruction timeline is ambitious but achievable with pre-planned work parties. The economic impact (cutting 40-50% of Northern anthracite supply) is realistic.  
**Source:** `gettysburg-master-timeline.md`

### 7. Pickett's "Lightning Raid" (June-July 1864)
**Plausibility:** 88%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Strong OTL precedent (Early's 1864 raid, Stuart's raids). A mounted corps of 14,000 men living off the country and avoiding pitched battles is exactly how Confederate cavalry operated. The 750-mile, 38-day ride is ambitious but within the realm of possibility.

## PEACE TREATY (1865)

### 8. Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865)
**Plausibility:** 90%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** After two years of Confederate victories and Northern exhaustion, a negotiated peace is highly plausible. The treaty terms (CSA independence, Native super-states, armistice) reflect realistic power dynamics.  
**Source:** `treaty-of-cincinnati.md`

### 8A. U.S. Never Tries to Reverse California Secession or CSA Independence (1865-1939)
**Plausibility:** 84%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The U.S. accepts permanent dismemberment of the pre-war United States. This is realistic because: (1) Exhaustion - the war broke Northern will, no appetite for another conflict, (2) No transcontinental land bridge - California is physically cut off by Native super-states and CSA territory, making reconquest logistically impossible, (3) Economic interdependence - both California and CSA become trading partners, making war counterproductive, (4) Political reality - by 1873 (California secession), the U.S. has already accepted CSA independence for 8 years, precedent is set, (5) American Concord (1919) formalizes the new reality - three nations, not one. The 84% reflects that revanchism is a powerful force, but the combination of exhaustion, geography, and economics makes it implausible. The U.S. might want to reverse it, but they can't.  
**Source:** `treaty-of-cincinnati.md`, `american-concord.md`  
**User Score:** 84% (matches)

### 9. Native Super-States Recognized in Treaty
**Plausibility:** 85%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The Five Civilized Tribes had existing treaties and infrastructure. Recognizing their sovereignty was a realistic way to create buffer zones and reduce border friction. The CSA had little choice given the tribes' strategic position.  
**Source:** `native-super-states-master.md`, `treaty-of-cincinnati.md`

## SLAVERY TIMELINE (1865-1905)

### 10. Toombs Act Re-Opens African Slave Trade (1867)
**Plausibility:** 88%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Toombs was a known fire-eater who advocated for re-opening the trade. The economic pressure (labor shortage, destroyed plantations) made this a realistic response. The act itself is plausible given Confederate victory and Toombs' position.  
**Source:** `slavery-and-raids-master.md`

### 11. Global Boycott Triggered by Toombs Act (1868)
**Plausibility:** 92%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Strong OTL precedent - Britain had been waiting for an excuse since 1861. The slave ship photographs in London papers (identical to OTL Brazil 1880s) would trigger immediate outrage. Royal Navy anti-slavery patrols are historical fact.  
**Source:** `slavery-and-raids-master.md`

### 12. "Last Hurrah" Raids (1865-1867)
**Plausibility:** 86%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Organized Northern abolitionist cells with veteran muscle is realistic. The raids are plausible given the Underground Railroad infrastructure and the anger of losing the war. The joint crackdown (1867-1869) is realistic - both sides have incentive to stop border chaos.  
**Source:** `slavery-and-raids-master.md`

### 13. Slavery Dies in Practice by 1894
**Plausibility:** 89%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The combination of global boycott, cotton glut, raids, and runaway crisis makes slavery economically unviable. This is realistic - economics, not morality, kills it. The timeline (30 years) is plausible given the economic pressures.  
**Source:** `slavery-and-raids-master.md`

### 14. Legal Abolition Delayed Until 1905
**Plausibility:** 84%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** OTL precedent (Brazil 1888-1898 "zombie" period). The CSA is on "probation" with the international community. The Cuba Mirror Effect (1898) provides the final push. The 11-year gap between practice and law is realistic given political inertia.  
**Source:** `slavery-and-raids-master.md`, `cuba-mirror-effect.md`

### 15. Night Riders Crushed Early (1877-1880), No Second KKK Ever Forms
**Plausibility:** 79%  
**Status:** GREEN FLAG (justified)  
**Justification:** Forrest dies 1877 (raider bullet or heart attack), organization splinters without leadership. Joint USA-CSA "anti-bandit" posses use raider tactics against them. By 1880 they're gone. The "no second KKK" part is the key - without the institutional terror network and with slavery dying economically, there's no fertile ground for a revival. The speed and completeness of the crackdown is ambitious but plausible given: (1) Forrest's death removes the charismatic leader, (2) Joint crackdown by both nations (unprecedented cooperation), (3) Economic pressure on slavery removes the core grievance, (4) No Reconstruction-era power vacuum to exploit. The 79% reflects that the "fast and clean" crackdown requires favorable conditions, but those conditions exist in the NTL.  
**Author Admission:** Killing off the founder of the KKK (Forrest) is **definitely inspired by author "feel-good" catharsis**. While the decision is plausible (Forrest's death removes the charismatic leader, making the crackdown more effective), there's also an emotional/narrative motivation: the author wants to see the KKK die in its infancy, before it can become the institutional terror network it became in OTL. This is honest acknowledgment that while the plausibility score stands, the choice is also driven by the desire for a more just outcome than history provided.

## CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENCE (1873)

### 16. California Secedes Peacefully (1873)
**Plausibility:** 88%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Economic leverage (gold, trade), geographic isolation, and OTL precedent (California's history of independence movements). The "quiet secession" is realistic - the US can't afford to fight while rebuilding, and California has the money to make it stick.  
**Source:** `california/ca-independence.md`

### 17. San Francisco as Capital (Not Sacramento)
**Plausibility:** 91%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** In 1873, San Francisco is the obvious choice - biggest city, main port, financial center, symbolic prestige. Sacramento only became capital in OTL for practical reasons that don't apply to an independent republic.  
**Source:** `california/ca-independence.md`

### 18. Treaty of San Francisco (1873)
**Plausibility:** 87%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Realistic treaty terms given California's economic leverage and US exhaustion. The peaceful nature is plausible - both sides benefit from avoiding war.  
**Source:** `california/ca-independence.md`

### 19. Pacific Alliance Forms (1894-1907) - California Quietly Bankrolls and Absorbs Oregon/Washington Economies
**Plausibility:** 81%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The "quiet absorption" mechanism is the key hinge. California doesn't conquer - it bankrolls. By 1894, California has 20 years of oil wealth, trade dominance, and economic leverage. Oregon and Washington are resource-rich but capital-poor. California provides: (1) Infrastructure investment (railroads, ports), (2) Market access (Asian trade routes), (3) Financial backing (loans, investments). In return, California gets: (1) Resource access (timber, fish, agriculture), (2) Strategic depth (defense, population), (3) Economic integration (de-facto currency zone). The Portland Articles (1894) and Treaty of Astoria (1907) formalize what's already happened economically. This is realistic - economic dominance without formal conquest is how modern empires work. The 81% reflects that the "quiet" mechanism requires California to be patient and subtle, which fits their pragmatic character.

**User Score:** 81% (matches)

### 20. California Purchases Alaska (1875-1876)
**Plausibility:** 79%  
**Status:** GREEN FLAG (justified)  
**Justification:** California has the money, Russia wants to sell, and the US is too broke/exhausted to compete. The purchase is realistic given California's wealth and strategic interests. The timeline (1875-1876) is plausible - California consolidates its position quickly.

## POLITICAL PARTIES (1865-1939)

### 21. Republican Party Fully Dies and Rebrands as Constitutional Union Party (1876-1880)
**Plausibility:** 88%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The "lost on purpose" narrative (Corwin Amendment + Lincoln-Greeley letters) makes the Republican brand toxic. After losing the war, the party has no credibility. The collapse is realistic given the political dynamics. The "fully dies" part is key - this isn't just a rebrand, it's the complete death of one of the two historic U.S. parties. The Constitutional Union Party rebrand (1878-1880) is ironic and realistic - ex-Republicans need a new brand, and this name lets them say "we were right all along, we just had the wrong name." The timing (after 1876 collapse) is plausible. The 88% reflects that party death is rare but not unprecedented (Whigs died, Federalists died), and the "lost on purpose" narrative provides the killing blow.  
**Source:** `political/presidents-and-parties.md`  
**User Score:** 88% (matches)

### 23. Democratic Party Collapses (1896)
**Plausibility:** 88%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The "But, Tennessee?" rhetorical lock, Hancock's death, Harris presidency, Great Cotton Fraud Scandal, and Scott Papers create terminal toxicity. The party that won the peace dies from the same poison it used to kill the Republicans. Realistic irony.  
**Source:** `political/presidents-and-parties.md`

### 24. National Union Party Rebrand (1896)
**Plausibility:** 83%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Ex-Democrats need a new brand after collapse. "National Union" is a realistic choice - it sounds patriotic and avoids the toxic "Democratic" name. The timing (after 1896 collapse) is plausible.  
**Source:** `political/presidents-and-parties.md`

### 25. Isham G. Harris as Toxic VP (1888-1890)
**Plausibility:** 72%  
**Status:** GREEN FLAG (justified)  
**Justification:** Hancock needed a "reconciliation" figure for the ticket. Harris was marketed as "reconstructed" Southerner who chose Union. The convention wisdom was "he'll sit quietly and never be president." When Hancock dies, Harris becomes the living embodiment of everything the North hated. The "But, Tennessee?" rhetorical lock is devastating. This is a stretch but dramatically earned.

## ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

### 26. Global Cotton Glut (1880s)
**Plausibility:** 93%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** OTL precedent - cotton production expanded globally (India, Egypt, Brazil) after the Civil War. In NTL, this happens faster due to CSA victory and continued slavery. The glut is virtually certain.  
**Source:** `economic/economic-systems-master.md`

### 27. Punitive Tariffs (1868-1905)
**Plausibility:** 89%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Realistic response to CSA victory and Toombs Act. The US has economic leverage and uses it. The tariffs are plausible given the political dynamics and economic interests.  
**Source:** `economic/economic-systems-master.md`

### 28. Great Depression Still Happens (1929)
**Plausibility:** 86%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** The underlying economic factors (overproduction, speculation, credit expansion) exist in NTL. The timing and severity might differ, but a major depression is highly plausible.  
**Source:** `economic/economic-systems-master.md`

## DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

### 29. American Concord Treaty (1919)
**Plausibility:** 81%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** After WWI, the three North American nations need a framework for cooperation. The Concord is realistic - it provides structure without forcing unity. The "three exhausted, mutually cancelling nations" dynamic makes this plausible.  
**Source:** `treaties/american-concord-treaty.md`

### 30. Monterey as Permanent Concord Seat
**Plausibility:** 84%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Neutral ground, historic significance, California controls infrastructure. The "neutral salon, not throne room" dynamic is realistic. California's wealth and position make this plausible.  
**Source:** `reference/monterey-concord-seat.md`

### 31. California-Japan Relationship (1876-1939)
**Plausibility:** 85%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** California inherits OTL US-Japan treaties, then renegotiates with "CA-style diplomacy." The pragmatic, business-first approach is realistic. The oil economics and long-game strategy are plausible given California's position.  
**Source:** `california/ca-japan-relationship.md`, `california/ca-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md`

---

## CULTURAL/SOCIAL

### 32. No "Woke" Politics by 2025
**Plausibility:** 96%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Five killer blows make this virtually certain: (1) No single moral superpower, (2) No "original sin → salvation" narrative, (3) No KKK/Jim Crow legacy, (4) No 1960s generational explosion, (5) California as sovereign nation (not academic factory). The analysis is ironclad.  
**Source:** `edits/woke-politics-ntl-analysis-2025-12-05.md`

### 33. Racism Persists But "Burns Out" Differently
**Plausibility:** 87%  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Justification:** Racism is too deeply woven into human nature to disappear completely. But without KKK terror and with different power dynamics, it evolves differently. More economic focus, less institutional terror. Realistic.  
**Source:** `slavery-and-raids-master.md`
