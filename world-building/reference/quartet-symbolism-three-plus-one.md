# Quartet Accord Symbolism: Three-Plus-One

**Status:** LOCKED CANON  
**Date Created:** December 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Resolve the "Quad-Flag Question" for the American Quartet Accord (1919–1939+)

## The Core Principle

There is **no official four-flag symbol**.

The Quartet Accord functions as four nations in practice but presents as **three-plus-one** in ceremony.

## The Tri-Flag Concord Badge – UNCHANGED

- Remains **three flags only:** USA, CSA, California
- Worn exclusively by Appomattox College graduates and Concord diplomatic/military personnel from the three participating nations
- California's flag stays 5% larger and forward (everyone still pretends not to notice)
- **Texas officers and diplomats never wear it**

## Texas's Position

### The Refusal

Texas **refuses all shared symbolic unity markers** that include the CSA.

### Public Rationale (1919)

> "The Republic of Texas cooperates in the Quartet Accord for practical continental security and trade. We do not require, nor will we accept, ceremonial symbols that imply reconciliation with nations whose actions necessitated our independence."

### Internal Rationale

Any flag beside the Lone Star feels like dilution of sovereignty—especially next to the CSA.

## How the Quartet Handles It

### Practical Function

- Four nations
- Four votes
- Four signatures
- Full participation in substance

### Ceremonial Presentation: Three-Plus-One

**Official documents and summit backdrops:**
- Tri-Flag Concord Badge (USA–CSA–California) prominently displayed
- Texas flag flown separately—equal size, equal height, but **physically apart** (e.g., on its own staff to the side)

**Protocol manuals:**
- Quietly describe it as "the Concord Triad with the Republic of Texas in association"
- No one officially complains—everyone understands the reality

## Informal Work-Arounds

### Summit Table
- Round table with four seats
- Texas delegate sits **opposite the CSA**—maximum distance

### Group Photographs
- Texas delegate positioned at the edge
- Lone Star pin visible

### Joint Statements
- Signed: "The United States of America, the Confederate States of America, the Republic of California, and the Republic of Texas"
- **Texas always last, by its own insistence**

## Outsider Perception

Foreign diplomats note the asymmetry with amusement:

**British memo (1925):**
> "The Quartet functions as three nations plus one very loud guest who refuses to share the family crest."

**Japanese assessment (1937):**
> "Texas participates fully in substance, minimally in form. This is consistent with their character."

## Thematic Significance

### What This Reinforces

- **Texas as the defiant shard:** Cooperation without sentiment
- **No illusion of reunification:** Texas will never "come home"
- **Quartet fragility:** Unity of necessity, not affection
- **Honest dysfunction:** Everyone knows the arrangement is awkward; nobody pretends otherwise

### The Pattern

| Domain | Reality | Presentation |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Votes | 4 equal | 4 equal |
| Signatures | 4 equal | 4 (Texas last, by choice) |
| Symbols | None shared | Tri-Flag + separate Lone Star |
| Seating | 4 seats | Texas opposite CSA |
| Protocol | 4 nations | "Triad in association with Texas" |

## Summary

The Quartet Accord has **no shared four-flag symbol**.

The Tri-Flag Concord Badge remains three flags.

Texas refuses symbolic unity with the CSA.

The other three work around it with quiet, practiced diplomacy.

The continent cooperates as **three-plus-one** in ceremony, four in practice.

**Texas stands apart—symbolically and literally.**

And everyone has learned to live with it.
