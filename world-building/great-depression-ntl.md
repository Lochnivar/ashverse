# The Great Depression in the NTL

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The Great Depression in the NTL:

- Starts the same (1929 crash + Dust Bowl)
- Hits harder and more unevenly
- Ends sooner because California refuses to let the other two collapse
- Leaves the three republics richer together than apart
- and hating each other a little more for needing the help

## The Four Phases

| Phase | Years | What the Three Republics Actually Do | Realism Check |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1 – Blame** | 1929–1931 | Each blames the others.<br>U.S.: "California hoarded gold and crashed the market."<br>CSA: "Yankee speculators and their tariffs."<br>California: "You both printed money like it was 1861 never ended." | 10/10 – classic post-crash finger-pointing |
| **Phase 2 – Compete** | 1931–1934 | Currency war, tariff war, beggar-thy-neighbour. All three devalue, raise barriers, try to steal markets from each other. | 10/10 – Smoot-Hawley on steroids |
| **Phase 3 – Panic** | 1934–1936 | Dust Bowl + bank runs hit simultaneously. Unemployment: U.S. 34%, CSA 39%, California 19%. Real starvation in Arkansas, breadlines while California still has oranges. | 10/10 – fractured continent = no unified safety net |
| **Phase 4 – Forced Cooperation** | 1936–1940 | California (least hurt, sitting on oil and gold) blackmails the other two into the table.<br>Result: North-American Economic Concord (1936) – joint gold pool, coordinated public works, California bankrolls relief at low interest. | 9/10 – exactly how real small rich countries force bigger poor neighbours to behave (think Switzerland in 1930s) |

## Depression by Republic

| Republic | Peak Unemployment | Worst Year | How They Survive the Depression |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **U.S. (East)** | 34–36% | 1934 | California loans + CSA raw materials |
| **CSA** | 38–41% | 1935 | California oil credits + U.S. factory orders |
| **Republic of California** | 17–19% | 1932 | Gold, oil, Hollywood, ports – barely feels it |

## Final Outcome by 1940

Depression ends faster than OTL (California money)

But the continent is now economically fused in a way OTL America never was

The triad is born in the crucible of mutual desperation

and no one ever lets anyone forget who paid the bills

## The Result

The Great Depression in the NTL:

- Starts the same (1929 crash + Dust Bowl)
- Hits harder and more unevenly
- Ends sooner because California refuses to let the other two collapse
- Leaves the three republics richer together than apart
- and hating each other a little more for needing the help
