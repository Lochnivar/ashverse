# The Last Hurrah Raids (1865-1867)

## **PERMANENT LOCK - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The Last Hurrah is organised Northern abolitionist terrorism  
with veteran muscle,  
quietly tolerated for one final burning season,  
then crushed the moment the new governments can move.

No government sanction.  
No spontaneous mobs.  
Just the dying scream of the people who lost the war  
but refused to lose the fight.

That's the ugly, perfect truth.

## Leadership Structure

### Faction Breakdown

| Faction | Leadership & Character (1865–1867) | Realism Check |
|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Organized Northern cells / underground networks** | The core – abolitionist societies (Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati) that never disbanded after the peace. Funded by Quaker money, Garrison radicals, and secret "John Brown Memorial Funds." | 10/10 |
| **Spontaneous Union veterans** | Join in large numbers, but never lead. They provide muscle and local knowledge, not strategy. | 9/10 |
| **Government-sanctioned** | Never. Lincoln is gone, McClellan is president. The U.S. officially denounces the raiders as criminals. | 0/10 |
| **Secret twist** | The raids are quietly protected by lame-duck Lincoln (March 1865) and early McClellan (April–July 1865) who refuse to use federal troops to stop them while the treaty ink is still wet. | 10/10 |

## Realistic Command Structure (1865–1867)

### Strategic Leadership
**"The Committee of Nine"** – nine hard-line abolitionists:
- Three ex-Underground Railroad operatives
- Three ex-Kansas jayhawkers
- Three radical clergy

Meeting in secret in Boston and Cincinnati.

### Field Commanders
Ex-Union cavalry officers (many former prisoners of war with scores to settle) who "resigned" the day the treaty was signed.

### Troops
Mix of:
- Freedmen who walked out of the CSA
- Union veterans who refused to muster out
- Idealistic college boys from New England

## Key Raids (Locked)

| Date | Name / Leader | Target & Result |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **May 1865** | "The Burning of the Black Belt" (Col. James Montgomery redux) | 27 plantations in Alabama torched in one week |
| **Oct 1865** | "The Great Carolina Ride" (led by ex-Captain Thomas Higginson) | 3,000 slaves liberated, 41 plantations burned |
| **Spring 1866** | "The Arkansas Night" | 19 cotton gins destroyed, 1,200 slaves reach Sequoyah |
| **Winter 1866–67** | Final wave – smaller, more desperate | CSA finally mobilises joint patrols with U.S. marshals |

## End of the Last Hurrah

### July 1867
Joint U.S.–CSA **"Border Pacification Act"** is signed.

### 1868–69
Leaders hanged in public trials (Richmond, Washington, and Boston).

### After 1869
Only local, small-scale copy-cat raids remain.

## The Nature of the Raids

The Last Hurrah is **organised Northern abolitionist terrorism**  
with veteran muscle,  
quietly tolerated for one final burning season,  
then crushed the moment the new governments can move.

No government sanction.  
No spontaneous mobs.  
Just the dying scream of the people who lost the war  
but refused to lose the fight.
