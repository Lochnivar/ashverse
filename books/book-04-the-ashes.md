## Book Blurb
September 30, 1939. Europe burns again. And the continent watches.

From 1920 to 1939, the final pieces fall into place. California has been independent since 1873—the Republic of California, fully sovereign and recognized for 47 years by 1920. The triad—the three-way relationship between the United States, the Confederacy, and California—is forged, ironically, in German stupidity, as European events force North American cooperation.

Seventy-six years after Robert E. Lee died at Gettysburg, the Fairfax and Meade families have watched history unfold across multiple generations. They've seen the birth, survival, and transformation of an independent Confederacy. They've witnessed the rise of sovereign Native super-states. They've observed the decades of raids, boycotts, and realpolitik that killed slavery.

Now, as Europe burns, they must confront the consequences of all the choices made over those decades. The ashes of the old conflicts still smolder. New fires are being lit. And the continent must decide: will it be consumed by the flames, or will it find a way to live with the ashes?

This is not a story about who was right in 1861. It is a story about what happens when everyone is wrong, and the continent still has to live with the ashes.

## Core Plot
From 1920 to September 30, 1939, the final transformation occurs. California has been independent since 1873—the Republic of California, fully sovereign and recognized for 47 years by 1920. The Great Depression hits the divided continent. Rising tensions in Europe force North American cooperation, and the triad—the three-way relationship between the United States, the Confederacy, and California—is forged in German stupidity, as European events create unexpected alliances.

The North American continent, having developed its own complex relationships over seven decades, watches as Europe moves toward war. The Fairfax and Meade families, with their multi-generational perspectives, see the patterns repeating. They understand that the choices made in 1863 and the decades that followed have led to this moment.

As September 30, 1939 arrives and Europe goes to war, the continent must confront its own history. The ashes of old conflicts still smolder. The independent nations of North America—now including California—must decide how to respond, what to learn, and how to move forward. The Fairfax and Meade families provide perspective, but ultimately, it is the current generations who must live with the consequences.

## Notes
- **Republic of California (independent since 1873)** - Has been its own country for 47 years by 1920. Rich, smug, Pacific superpower. The North America equivalent of Australia.
- **California's evolution:** Loyal U.S. state (1850) → De-facto exclave (1865-1870) → Growing independence (1870-1872) → Great Native Toll War (1872) → Independence referendum (Nov 1872) → Treaty of San Francisco (Feb 1873) → Republic of California (July 1873+)
- **No land bridge** - Sea and air only. Geographic isolation drives political independence.
- **California's wealth** - Gold → oil → Hollywood → Silicon Valley. Too rich to bully back into line.
- September 1939 is the climactic moment: Europe burns, continent watches
- Bring together all the threads from the previous three books
- The Fairfax and Meade families provide perspective but don't solve everything
- Focus on the theme: "what happens when everyone is wrong"
- The ashes metaphor: what remains after the fire
- Leave some questions open - history continues
- Emphasize that this isn't about who was right, but about living with consequences
