# Ideas & Notes

## Random Ideas
- The Fairfax and Haskell families might be named after historical figures (Fairfax = Confederate connection? Haskell = Union officer Frank A. Haskell at Gettysburg)
- How do the families handle relationships across generations? Do they maintain family traditions?
- The "quiet secession" of California - how does this actually work? Economic? Political? Both?
- Native super-states: which tribes consolidate? How do they maintain sovereignty?
- The gap between slavery's death in practice (1894) vs. legal abolition (1905) - what keeps it legal for 11 years?

## Research Notes
- Need to research: What would have happened if Lee died at Gettysburg?
- Confederate economy and how it might have survived independence
- Native American tribal structures and potential for consolidation
- California's history and potential for independence
- Economic boycotts and realpolitik in the 19th century
- How slavery actually died in practice (economics, international pressure)
- European events leading to 1939
- Historical figures who would be involved in each time period

## Questions to Answer
- How do the Fairfax and Haskell families interact with historical figures?
- What specific Native tribes consolidate into super-states?
- How exactly does California secede "quietly"?
- What economic pressures kill slavery in practice by 1894?
- Why does it take until 1905 for legal abolition?
- How does the continent respond to Europe in 1939?
- What are the specific consequences of the divided continent?

## Things to Remember
- July 1, 1863: Lee dies at Gettysburg - the point of divergence
- 1894: Slavery dies in practice ("The Last Chain Falls")
- 1905: Legal abolition of slavery (11 years after practice died)
- September 1939: Europe burns, continent watches
- 76 years span the series (1863-1939)
- The theme: "what happens when everyone is wrong"
- The ashes metaphor: what remains after the fire

## Inspiration
- Alternate history novels (Harry Turtledove, etc.)
- Stories about historical perspective across generations
- Complex political situations where no one is entirely right
- The slow, grinding nature of historical change
- Economic and social forces vs. legal structures

## Plot Holes to Fix
- Need to establish: How exactly does the war end differently without Lee?
- What prevents the Union from continuing to fight?
- How do Native tribes actually consolidate into super-states?
- What makes California's secession "quiet"?
- How does slavery die in practice while remaining legal?
- What keeps it legal for 11 years after practice ends?

## Character Development Ideas
- Different members of Fairfax and Haskell families in different time periods
- Historical figures adapted to the new timeline
- Ordinary people caught in the changes
- Those who remember the old ways vs. new generations
- Characters who must navigate the new continental reality

## World Building Ideas
- Specific Native super-states and their territories
- California's government and economy as independent republic
- Confederate economic struggles and adaptations
- Union adjustments to multiple neighbors
- Border regions and how they function
- International relations (Europe, other nations)
- How technology progresses in the divided continent

## Dialogue Snippets
- "It is not a story about who was right in 1861."
- "It is a story about what happens when everyone is wrong."
- "The continent still has to live with the ashes."
- "Eleven years after it died in practice."
- "Everyone is wrong, and the continent still has to live with the ashes."

## Scene Ideas
- Lee's death at Gettysburg - the moment of divergence
- The negotiated peace and Confederate independence
- Native leaders consolidating into super-states
- California's quiet secession
- The moment slavery dies in practice (economic/political)
- The 1905 legal abolition (11 years later)
- The Fairfax and Haskell families watching history unfold
- September 1939: Europe burns, continent watches
- Reflection on the ashes and what remains
