### The Legal Fiction (Late January 1865)
- Assembles army through old orders + personal loyalty

- "Halleck doesn't have the balls. It's now or never."

### The Final Gamble (February 18-20, 1865)

## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not a Drunk** - Alcohol issues in OTL, but not defining trait
- **Not a Butcher** - Accepts casualties but doesn't waste lives
- **Not a Failure** - Competent general in impossible situation
- **Not a Martyr** - Pragmatic, not self-sacrificing

### Key Contradictions
- **West Point Friend of Longstreet** - Personal friendship vs. military opposition
- **Never Promoted** - Most capable general never gets overall command
- **Tries and Fails** - Competent general in impossible situation
- **Respected but Defeated** - Admired for trying, but war is lost

### Writing Tips
- Show his determination through actions, not speeches
- Contrast his persistence with others' caution

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No perfect film portrayal** - Grant has been played many times, but most are either too heroic or too disheveled

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Project & Year | Why It Works for NTL Grant | Specific Scene Fit |
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Kevin Costner** (1990s–early 2000s prime) | *Dances with Wolves* (1990), *The Postman* (1997), *Open Range* (2003) | The definitive quiet-competence American archetype. Weathered, cigar-chomping, speaks softly but every man in the regiment would still follow him into hell. Costner's exhausted eyes in *Open Range* are exactly the look Grant has at Appomattox when he realizes the numbers no longer work. | The "legal fiction" speech to his staff and the silent handshake with Longstreet. Costner can do three minutes of screen time without a word and still break you. |
| **Jeff Daniels** | *Gettysburg* (1993) as Joshua Chamberlain, but aged up | Already proved he can play a bearded, thoughtful, quietly ferocious Civil War officer who carries unbearable moral weight. Give him 15 extra pounds, a worse haircut, and a cigar and he's Grant in winter 1865. | The moment he tells his aides "We're marching to our own funeral, but we're marching." Daniels would make it sound like scripture. |
| **Josh Brolin** (modern choice) | *No Country for Old Men* (2007), *Sicario* (2015), *Dune* (2021) | The modern heir to Costner's slot. Stocky, gravel-voiced, eyes that have already seen the ending. Brolin's Gurney Halleck is basically Grant with a sword. | The surrender parlor: Brolin can make the silence after "The end came not with thunder…" feel like the continent just exhaled and died. |
| **Ed Harris** (evergreen) | *The Right Stuff* (1983), *Appaloosa* (2008), *Westworld* | The gold standard for competent, exhausted, decent men who refuse to quit even when quitting would be merciful. Harris's John Glenn stoicism is Grant to the bone. | The late-night dispatch-writing scenes—Harris pacing with a cigar, muttering logistics to himself, knowing it's hopeless but doing it anyway. |
| **Jason Clarke** (rising dark horse) | *Zero Dark Thirty* (2012), *First Man* (2018), *Winning Time* (2022) | Underrated beast at playing stubborn, brilliant, quietly tormented leaders. His Jerry West in *Winning Time* already has the unkempt beard, the cigars, and the "I will outwork fate" energy. | Perfect for the "Halleck doesn't have the balls" moment—Clarke can make it sound like a man signing his own death warrant and still meaning every word. |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The "legal fiction" scene** needs to show quiet determination, not desperation
- **The surrender to Longstreet** (old friend) adds personal weight that most Grant portrayals miss
- **Key quality:** The opposite of a "hero" general - more like a competent manager who happens to command armies
- **Physical presence:** Stocky, unkempt, cigar-chomping, but every man would follow him
