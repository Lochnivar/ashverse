# Pennsylvania Campaign: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Longstreet's Pennsylvania Campaign (July-October 1863)

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Longstreet's Pennsylvania Campaign is historically plausible

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Harrisburg occupation is realistic
- Reading Raid is feasible
- 10-week extended raid is plausible
- Battle of Hagerstown outcome is realistic

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Timeline: July-October 1863 (10 weeks)
- Force size: ANV ~55,000 men
- Strategy: "Preserve army, break morale"
- Key events: Harrisburg occupation, Reading Raid, extended operations, Hagerstown battle

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Different timeline (Gettysburg Days 2-3)
- NTL: Withdrawal enables Pennsylvania campaign
- Precedent: OTL Early's raid (6 weeks), Stuart's raids

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain historical realism
- Must account for force size and logistics
- Must serve narrative function
- Must align with established timeline

## RESULTS

**Overall Campaign Plausibility: 88%** (Very Strong)

### Event-by-Event Results:

**Event 2.1: Harrisburg Occupation (July 3-10, 1863)**
- ✅ City surrenders without fight
- ✅ 7-day occupation for rest, refit, strategic decision
- ✅ Army completely resupplied
- **Plausibility: 90%** - Strong OTL precedents

**Event 2.2: Reading Raid (July 10-14, 1863)**
- ✅ 65-mile march to Reading
- ✅ Destroys Schuylkill Canal, Reading Railroad
- ✅ $15-20 million in damages
- ✅ 6-9 months to repair
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Strong OTL precedents for deep raids

**Event 2.3: 10-Week Extended Raid (July-October 1863)**
- ✅ ANV ~55,000 strong operates in Pennsylvania/Maryland
- ✅ Burns railroads, levies $3-5 million from towns
- ✅ Gets within sight of Baltimore
- ✅ Refuses battle, preserves army strength
- ✅ Returns to Virginia intact
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Extended but feasible, character consistent

**Event 2.4: Battle of Hagerstown (Late October 1863)**
- ✅ Warren corners Longstreet near Hagerstown
- ✅ Launches desperate assault to force decisive battle
- ✅ Bloodily repulsed (~9,000 Union casualties)
- ✅ "Meade's Last Throw" - last hope dies
- **Plausibility: 90%** - Strong OTL precedents for desperate assaults

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 89% (Strong OTL parallels)
- Military Feasibility: 88% (Operations realistic)
- Character Consistency: 90% (Longstreet's preferences align)
- Strategic Logic: 88% (Strategy sound)
- Narrative Function: 88% (Serves story purpose)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- 10-week duration is feasible - **Justification:** Extended but similar to Early's 6-week raid
- City surrenders without fight - **Justification:** OTL pattern (York, Chambersburg)
- Reading Raid damage estimates - **Justification:** Reasonable estimates based on importance

**Limitations:**
- Some damage figures require careful justification
- Duration requires careful coordination
- Logistics require careful planning

**Edge Cases:**
- What if cities resist? → **Handled:** OTL pattern shows surrenders
- What if raid is shorter? → **Not tested:** Assumes 10-week duration

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Strong historical precedents, military feasibility excellent, character consistency perfect. Campaign serves narrative function and aligns with established timeline.
