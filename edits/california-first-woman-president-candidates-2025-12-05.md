## CANDIDATE ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Florence Prag Kahn (1866-1948) - "The Congresswoman"

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL Florence Prag Kahn (1866-1948), first Jewish woman in Congress, California  
**Age in 1909:** 43 (born 1866)  
**OTL Role:** First Jewish woman in Congress (1925-1937), California, Republican  
**NTL Fit:** Good - but more political than "radio queen"  
**Plausibility:** 82% - Real person, good age, but doesn't fit "radio queen" narrative

**Strengths:**
- Real person, US-born (Salt Lake City, but moved to California)

- Age 43 in 1909 (good, but could be older)

- More political than media personality
- Congress career was 1925-1937 (after our term)
