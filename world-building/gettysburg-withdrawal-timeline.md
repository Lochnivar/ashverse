## DECISION POINT

**04:00, July 2, 1863** – Longstreet's decision locked in. No west, no Chambersburg Pike retreat, no South Mountain gaps.

**Longstreet's Written Order (one sentence):**
> "Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed."

## WITHDRAWAL SEQUENCE (04:00 onward)

Positions based on Battlefield Trust dusk-1-July map + NPS nightfall overlay.

| Time Window | First Unit(s) to Move | Night Position (1 July) | Exact Road Taken at Start | Direction & First Objective |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 04:00–04:15 | Reserve artillery trains + corps ammunition wagons | Already parked north-west of town along Mummasburg Road | Mummasburg Road → Table Rock → Heidlersburg | Straight north – trains are the absolute priority to clear the road |
| 04:05–04:25 | **Rodes' Division** – Daniel's brigade (farthest north) | Oak Hill and fields north of the railroad cut | Mummasburg Road north | Daniel pulls out first – they are literally sitting on the road that becomes the axis of march |
| 04:15–04:40 | Rodes – Doles, Ramseur, O'Neal, Iverson | Northern edge of town and railroad cut | All file onto Mummasburg Road behind Daniel | By 05:00 the entire division is in column heading north |
| 04:20–04:50 | **Early's Division** – Hays, Avery, Gordon, Hoke-minus-Smith | East and northeast side of town (Baltimore St. to Hanover Rd.) | Pull back through town square → left turn onto Carlisle / Harrisburg Road (modern US-30 / PA-94 north) | Early's men countermarch straight through Gettysburg streets and out the north side |
| 04:40–05:15 | **Johnson's Division** – Steuart, Jones, Nicholls, Walker | East of Culp's Hill / Rock Creek | Rock Creek bridge → Hanover Rd. → left on Carlisle Rd. at Heidlersburg | Johnson has to march west through town first, then north – last of Second Corps to clear |
| 04:30–05:30 | **Anderson's Division** (Third Corps) – Wilcox, Mahone, Wright, Posey, Perry | Herr Ridge / Seminary Ridge (western face) | Fairfield Rd. → Mummasburg Rd. → north | They swing around the west side of town and feed onto the same Mummasburg axis behind Rodes |
| 04:45–05:45 | **Pender's Division** – Lane, Thomas, Scales, McGowan | Herr Ridge reserve | Same Fairfield → Mummasburg route | Follows Anderson |
| 05:00–06:00 | **Heth / Pettigrew** – battered remnants | Seminary Ridge proper | Same loop around west side of town → Mummasburg Rd. | Slowest because of casualties and exhaustion |
| 05:00–06:30 | **Hood & McLaws** (First Corps) – never closed up | Hood near Marsh Creek, McLaws near Black Horse Tavern | Immediate 180° turn → Fairfield Rd. → Mummasburg Rd. → north | They simply reverse and march straight to the party |
| 05:30–07:00 | **Pickett's Division** – still near Chambersburg | 22 miles west | Already ordered by galloper at 04:30 to swing northeast on the Greenwood–Fairfield road and join the column at Cashtown Gap, then turn north | Acts as temporary left-flank guard until the whole army is clear |

## ROAD FLOW BY SUNRISE (≈05:30)

- **Single file column** on the **Mummasburg → Table Rock → Heidlersburg → Carlisle Pike** (modern PA-34 / old US-15 north).

- **Head of column** (reserve artillery + Daniel's brigade) already 5–6 miles north of Gettysburg.

- **Tail of column** (Heth/Pettigrew + Hood) still clearing the western edge of town.

- **Entire army** is using **one primary road** with occasional parallel farm lanes – classic interior-lines march, but congested as hell for the first 6–8 hours.

---

## UNION REACTION WINDOW

- **First grey light:** 04:45
- **Buford's vedettes** on the northern picket line report movement: ≈05:30–06:00
- **Hancock/Howard** wake Meade: ≈06:30
- **Meade's earliest possible reconnaissance** in force north: 07:30–08:00

**By then Longstreet already has 3–4 hours and 8–10 miles of road dust between him and the Cemetery Hill line.**

## KEY POINTS

1. **Withdrawal axis:** North and northeast toward Carlisle / Harrisburg (NOT west, NOT Chambersburg Pike, NOT South Mountain gaps)

2. **Decision time:** 04:00, July 2, 1863

3. **Single road:** The entire army uses one primary road (Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road) with occasional parallel farm lanes

4. **Speed:** The army is gone before Meade finishes his first cup of coffee

5. **Priority:** Reserve artillery trains and ammunition wagons move first (04:00–04:15) to clear the road

6. **Last to move:** Heth/Pettigrew (battered remnants) are slowest due to casualties and exhaustion

7. **Pickett's Division:** Still 22 miles west near Chambersburg, ordered at 04:30 to swing northeast and join the column

## NOTES FOR WRITING

- The 04:00 decision → immediate north-bound march works like clockwork
- The army is completely gone before Union reconnaissance can effectively respond
- Longstreet has 3–4 hours head start and 8–10 miles of road between him and Cemetery Hill by the time Meade can react
- The withdrawal is a single-file column on one primary road – congested but effective
- Early's Division countermarches straight through Gettysburg streets (dramatic visual)
- Johnson's Division has to march west through town first, then north (last of Second Corps to clear)
