# Raid Count Plausibility Analysis: Organized vs. Viral Phases

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Purpose:** Analyze reasonable and plausible raid counts for organized phase (1865-1867) and decentralized/viral phase (1867-1894)

---

## ESTABLISHED CANON CONTEXT

**Phase 1: Organized Phase (1865-1867) - "The Committee of Nine"**
- **Duration:** 2.5 years (May 1865 - July 1867)
- **Structure:** Unified, private, non-governmental effort
- **Leadership:** Committee of Nine (strategic) + ex-Union cavalry officers (field commanders)
- **Funding:** Abolitionist societies, Quaker money, "John Brown Memorial Funds"
- **Current estimate:** ~50 major raids
- **End:** Joint USA-CSA Border Pacification Act (July 1867), organized cells crushed by 1869

**Phase 2: Decentralized/Viral Phase (1867-1894)**
- **Duration:** 27 years (1867-1894)
- **Structure:** Local copy-cats, decentralized, no central coordination
- **Leadership:** None (truly decentralized)
- **Funding:** Local, ad-hoc
- **Current estimate:** 10-20 raids/year = 270-540 total
- **Nature:** Small-scale, local operations

**Total Current Estimate:** ~270-320 raids (from outline) OR 320-590 raids (from calculation)

## HISTORICAL PARALLELS FOR ANALYSIS

### Phase 1: Organized Private Resistance

**John Brown's Raid (1859):**
- Single major operation
- ~20 men, one target
- **Takeaway:** Major operations require significant planning/resources

**Kansas Jayhawkers (1854-1861):**
- Multiple raids over 7 years
- Estimated 50-100 major raids total
- ~7-14 raids/year
- **Takeaway:** Organized guerrilla operations can sustain moderate frequency

**Underground Railroad (1830s-1860s):**
- Hundreds of operations over 30+ years
- Mostly small-scale (1-10 people per operation)
- ~10-20 operations/year (estimated)
- **Takeaway:** Private, decentralized operations can sustain low-moderate frequency

**Abolitionist Societies (1830s-1860s):**
- Multiple organizations, coordinated efforts
- Pamphlets, speeches, legal challenges
- Direct action: rare, high-risk
- **Takeaway:** Organized private groups prefer low-risk, high-impact operations

### Phase 2: Decentralized/Viral Movements

**Underground Railroad (post-1850):**
- Fully decentralized after Fugitive Slave Act
- Local networks, no central coordination
- Estimated 20-40 operations/year (small-scale)
- **Takeaway:** Decentralized movements can sustain moderate frequency

**Post-Civil War KKK (1865-1871):**
- Decentralized, local chapters
- Hundreds of incidents over 6 years
- ~50-100 incidents/year (estimated)
- **Takeaway:** Viral movements can sustain high frequency if not suppressed

**Modern Copy-Cat Movements:**
- Social media viral challenges: 100s-1000s of participants
- But physical operations: much lower (10-50/year)
- **Takeaway:** Viral = awareness, not necessarily high operational frequency

## PHASE 1 ANALYSIS: ORGANIZED EFFORT (1865-1867)

### Constraints

**1. Resource Limitations:**
- Private funding (not government)
- Limited to abolitionist societies, Quaker money, "John Brown Memorial Funds"
- Estimated total funding: $500K-$2M over 2.5 years (based on historical abolitionist budgets)
- **Impact:** Can fund ~20-50 major operations (each costing $10K-$50K)

**2. Operational Complexity:**
- Major raids require: 50-200 men, horses, weapons, supplies, intelligence
- Planning time: 2-4 weeks per raid
- Execution: 1-7 days
- **Impact:** Maximum sustainable frequency: ~1-2 raids/month (12-24/year)

**3. Detection Risk:**
- Organized cells = easier to infiltrate/track
- Central coordination = single point of failure
- **Impact:** Too many raids = increased detection risk

**4. Historical Precedent:**
- Kansas Jayhawkers: ~7-14 raids/year (organized, 7 years)
- John Brown: 1 major raid (organized, single operation)
- **Takeaway:** Organized private operations: 10-20 major raids/year is plausible

### Plausible Range for Phase 1

**Conservative Estimate:**
- **30-40 major raids** over 2.5 years
- **12-16 raids/year**
- **1-1.5 raids/month**
- **Rationale:** Limited resources, operational complexity, detection risk

**Moderate Estimate (Current Canon):**
- **~50 major raids** over 2.5 years
- **~20 raids/year**
- **~1.5-2 raids/month**
- **Rationale:** Well-funded, organized, but still private effort

**Aggressive Estimate:**
- **60-80 major raids** over 2.5 years
- **24-32 raids/year**
- **2-2.5 raids/month**
- **Rationale:** Desperate, well-funded, high-risk tolerance

**RECOMMENDATION: ~50 major raids (current canon) is PLAUSIBLE (8/10)**
- Matches historical precedent (Kansas Jayhawkers)
- Accounts for resource limitations
- Sustainable operational tempo
- High enough to be significant, low enough to avoid immediate detection

---

## PHASE 2 ANALYSIS: DECENTRALIZED/VIRAL (1867-1894)

### Constraints

**1. Decentralized Nature:**
- No central coordination = no resource pooling
- Local groups = limited resources per group
- **Impact:** Smaller-scale operations, lower frequency per group

**2. Detection Risk:**
- Decentralized = harder to track (good)
- But also = no coordination = easier to catch individual groups (bad)
- Joint USA-CSA patrols (1867-1869) = high detection risk early
- **Impact:** Early years (1867-1875) = lower frequency, later years (1875-1894) = higher frequency as patrols relax

**3. "Viral" Spread:**
- Copy-cat effect = more groups form over time
- But also = more groups get caught
- **Impact:** Frequency increases over time, then plateaus/declines as groups are caught

**4. Resource Limitations:**
- Local funding only (no central funding)
- Each group must self-fund
- **Impact:** Smaller operations, lower frequency

**5. Historical Precedent:**
- Underground Railroad (post-1850): ~20-40 operations/year (decentralized, 15 years)
- Post-Civil War KKK: ~50-100 incidents/year (decentralized, 6 years, but different context)
- **Takeaway:** Decentralized movements: 15-40 operations/year is plausible

### Plausible Range for Phase 2

**Early Period (1867-1875): High Suppression**
- Joint patrols active (1867-1869)
- Organized cells crushed (1868-1869)
- High detection risk
- **Plausible:** 5-10 raids/year = 40-80 total

**Middle Period (1875-1885): Relaxed Suppression**
- Joint patrols reduced/ended
- Copy-cat groups multiply
- Lower detection risk
- **Plausible:** 15-25 raids/year = 150-250 total

**Late Period (1885-1894): Established Pattern**
- Routine suppression (local, not joint)
- Copy-cat groups continue
- Moderate detection risk
- **Plausible:** 10-20 raids/year = 100-200 total

**Conservative Estimate:**
- **Total: 290-530 raids** over 27 years
- **Average: ~11-20 raids/year**
- **Rationale:** Decentralized = lower frequency, but sustained over long period

**Moderate Estimate (Current Canon Range):**
- **Total: 270-320 raids** (from outline) OR **320-590 raids** (from calculation)
- **Average: ~10-22 raids/year**
- **Rationale:** Matches historical precedent, accounts for suppression cycles

**Aggressive Estimate:**
- **Total: 400-600 raids** over 27 years
- **Average: ~15-22 raids/year**
- **Rationale:** High viral spread, low suppression after 1875

**RECOMMENDATION: 300-400 raids total (11-15/year average) is MOST PLAUSIBLE (9/10)**
- Accounts for suppression cycles (low early, higher middle, moderate late)
- Matches historical precedent (Underground Railroad)
- Sustainable for decentralized movement
- High enough to be significant, low enough to avoid systematic elimination

## COMPARISON TO CURRENT CANON

**Current Canon Estimates:**
- Outline: ~270-320 raids total
- Calculation: ~320-590 raids total
- **Gap: 50-270 raids difference**

**Recommended Estimate:**
- **350-450 raids total**
- **Falls within calculation range (320-590)**
- **Slightly above outline range (270-320)**
- **Rationale:** Outline may be conservative; calculation range is too wide

**Recommendation:** Use **350-450 raids total** as the locked figure
- More precise than current ranges
- Plausible based on historical precedent
- Accounts for both organized and viral phases
- Matches economic impact ($1.6B over 29.5 years = ~$54M/year, which aligns with ~12-15 raids/year at ~$3-4M damage per raid average)

---

## ECONOMIC IMPACT VALIDATION

**Total Economic Impact: $1.6B (1865 dollars) - LOCKED**

**If 350-450 raids total:**
- Average damage per raid: $1.6B ÷ 400 raids = **$4M per raid**
- This seems high for small-scale decentralized raids

**Alternative Calculation:**
- Phase 1 (50 major raids): $200M total = **$4M per major raid** ✅ Plausible
- Phase 2 (300-400 smaller raids): $1.4B total = **$3.5-4.7M per raid** ✅ Plausible (if some are larger)

**Conclusion:** 350-450 raids total is economically consistent with $1.6B total impact

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Phase 1 (1865-1867): ~50 major raids** ✅ **LOCKED - Current canon is plausible**

**Phase 2 (1867-1894): 300-400 raids total**
- 1867-1875: 40-60 raids (high suppression)
- 1875-1885: 150-200 raids (viral spread)
- 1885-1894: 110-140 raids (routine suppression)

**Total (1865-1894): 350-450 raids** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Plausibility Score: 9/10**
- Matches historical precedent
- Accounts for suppression cycles
- Economically consistent
- Sustainable for both organized and viral phases
