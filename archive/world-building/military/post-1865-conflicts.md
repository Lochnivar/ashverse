# Post-1865 Conflicts Between the Three Republics

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Do the three republics ever fight each other after 1865? Or is it all economic/political conflict?

## The Answer

**No shooting wars after 1865.**

All conflict is governed by the single unbreakable rule of the triad:

The United States, the Confederate States, and the Republic of California

are three quarrelsome siblings who had one catastrophically bad Thanksgiving in 1861–1865

that nobody has ever forgotten

and nobody is ever allowed to forget.

## What They Still Do

They still:

- sit at the same table (triad summits)
- pass the potatoes (zero internal tariffs after 1905)
- argue over who started it and who gets the bigger slice (every single political crisis)
- threaten to storm out and take their toys home
- and always, always, show up when the house is on fire

Because blood is thicker than borders,

and nobody else on the planet is family.

## Result 1865–2025

No direct military conflict between the three republics after the Treaty of Cincinnati.

Every crisis is economic, diplomatic, legal, or spectacularly passive-aggressive.

The worst incident (1927 Kentucky Neutral Zone Crisis) ends with 38 dead and both presidents on the phone to California within 48 hours begging the pumps to stay on.

## The Reality

**Lock it.**

After 1865 the three republics never fight each other again.

They just spend 160 years

perfecting the art of the family feud with nuclear weapons.
