## Background

Following the destruction at Reading (July 13–14), Longstreet began his southwest pivot on July 15. His intended route led through Lancaster and the Wrightsville/Columbia crossing of the Susquehanna, placing York directly on his line of march.

Meade, alerted to the Reading attack by July 14 morning, correctly anticipated Longstreet's probable retreat path and reinforced the York outpost corps with rapid marches and rail movement from the Baltimore concentration.

Longstreet, focused on speed and underestimating Meade's reaction time, approached York on July 17 to find the position fortified and strengthening.

**Longstreet's Realization (July 17 evening):**
> "Foul-up — Meade moved faster than I credited. Should have reversed to Harrisburg/Chambersburg — kept mountains between us. But we're here now, and Meade isn't fully ready. We strike at dawn, break through before he masses."

## The Battle (July 18, 1863 – Single-Day Mobile Engagement)

### Terrain

- York sits in rolling farmland with low hills to the north (toward the Susquehanna bluffs) and south (Wilshire Hills/Pigeon Hills area).
- Approaches from the northeast (Wrightsville direction) funneled by the river and hills, creating a natural defensive position.
- Open ground north of the town (Woodstream–Pleasureville–Mt Zion area) offered maneuver space.

### Longstreet's Plan

- Recognizing the risk of delay, Longstreet committed to a forced passage in one day.
- **Frontal fixing assault** (Early's Division): Heavy pressure on Union center and southern flank to pin reserves.
- **Northern flanking slide** (Pickett's Division with Hampton's cavalry): Wide maneuver through open farmland north of York (Woodstream–Pleasureville area) to threaten Union rear and communications.

### Course of the Battle

- **Dawn–Midday:** Early's assaults struck Union fortifications head-on. Intense artillery duels and infantry fighting fixed Union attention south and center. Confederate casualties: ~2,000 (assault cost on prepared positions).
- **Midday–Afternoon:** Custer's Michigan Cavalry Brigade executes successful dash across Columbia/Wrightsville ford. Hampton personally leads Confederate cavalry response to contain breakthrough — **Hampton killed** leading counterattack (shot leading charge or in melee). Custer's raid repulsed, but Confederate cavalry loses its commander. **Fitzhugh Lee** (senior brigade commander after Hampton) immediately assumes overall cavalry corps command. Pickett and Fitz Lee then execute the northern slide, swinging wide to threaten Union retreat lines toward Baltimore and the Susquehanna crossings. Flank threat compromised Union position.
- **Late Afternoon–Dusk:** Flank threat unhinged the Union position. Union commander ordered withdrawal southeast to avoid encirclement. Longstreet's main column pushed through the gap, continuing southwest toward Gettysburg and the Cumberland Valley.

### Casualties

- **Confederate:** ~4,500 (higher due to assault role and oblique attacks)
  - Breakdown: ~2,000 in frontal assaults, ~1,500 in breakthrough, ~1,000 in supporting actions
- **Union:** ~2,800 (defensive advantage, but outmaneuvered)

**Casualty Ratio:** Confederate losses higher (attackers vs. prepared defenders), but breakthrough achieved.

## Outcome

- Longstreet successfully forced passage through York with a one-day delay.
- Union delaying action inflicted significant cost and nearly trapped the Confederate column.
- Longstreet resumed march July 19, reaching the Potomac early August and crossing safely.

**Longstreet's Reflection (Evening, July 18):**
> "My haste nearly cost us — but the boys carried it. Early fixed them, Pickett and Fitz Lee turned their flank, and we broke through. Still, I should have reversed north after Reading. Lesson learned: speed is nothing without proper reconnaissance. The mountains would have protected us."
>
> [To Fitz Lee, privately]: "Hampton's death is a heavy price. But you'll do well, Fitz. The cavalry is yours now — make it count."

## Significance

- Demonstrated Meade's improving reaction speed under Warren.
- Exposed Longstreet to the consequences of underestimating Union mobility.
- Added measurable cost to an otherwise successful campaign, reinforcing the theme of earned victories.
- Sets up winter despair theme: Union: "We had him at York and let him slip."

---

## Narrative Role

- Turning point in the return march: Longstreet's only significant engagement on the withdrawal.
- Humanizes Longstreet (miscalculation due to haste/overconfidence).
- Showcases Early and Fitz Lee/Pickett aggression — toolbox rotation compensates for Longstreet's error.
- Custer's York dash costs Confederate cavalry its commander — Custer's "rare success" has real bite
- Hampton's death gives CSA cavalry a costly "black eye" despite repulsing Custer
- Cavalry command transition: Hampton dead, Fitz Lee promoted — CSA cavalry talent depth reduced (Stuart exiled west, Hampton dead, Fitz Lee competent but not elite)
- Avoids "Mary Sue" outcome: victory costly, not effortless escape.
