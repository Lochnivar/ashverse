# Strict Consolidation Plan - Project-Wide

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Strict consolidation by subject, creating larger organized files  
**Golden Rule:** No files in `books/` folder touched

---

## CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY

**Principle:** Group related files by subject into larger, well-organized documents with clear sections.

**Approach:**
1. Identify subject categories
2. Consolidate related files into master documents
3. Create navigation indexes
4. Respect LOCKED CANON (can still consolidate if related)
5. Keep books/ folder untouched

---
