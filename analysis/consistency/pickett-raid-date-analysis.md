# Pickett's Lightning Raid: Date Analysis

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Evaluate both versions of Pickett's Raid dates for plausibility and timeline impact

---

## THE CONFLICT

Two different date ranges exist for Pickett's Lightning Raid:

### Version A: June 8-28, 1864 (21 days)
**Sources:**
- `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` (old reference - no longer current)
- `world-building/timelines/northern-collapse-1863-1865.md` (archived - consolidated into `world-building-master/06-timelines.md`)
- `world-building/timelines/master-timeline.md` (archived - consolidated into `world-building-master/06-timelines.md`)

### Version B: June 14 - July 14, 1864 (30 days actual raiding)
**Sources:**
- `world-building-master/06-timelines.md` (CURRENT MASTER): **"14 Jun–14 Jul 1864"** - "30 days actual raiding"
- `canon-refresher-for-ai.md` (CURRENT): **"June 14-July 14, 1864"** - "30 days actual raiding"

### Version C: June 14 - July 22, 1864 (38 days)
**Sources:**
- `world-building/timelines/gettysburg-master-timeline.md` (archived - consolidated into `world-building-master/06-timelines.md`) - Multiple references

**Note:** Current master timeline shows **June 14 - July 14** (30 days), which appears to be a compromise between the two extremes.

## KEY DETAILS (Locked Canon)

- **Troop Strength:** 14,000 men mounted
- **Actual Raiding Duration:** 30 days (per current master timeline)
- **Newspaper Myth:** "FORTY DAYS OF TERROR!" (Pickett never corrects this)
- **Distance:** 750 miles (mentioned in archived timeline)
- **Plausibility Score:** 88%
- **Key Consequence:** Proves North cannot defend own territory, boosts peace movement

---

## CRITICAL TIMELINE ANCHOR POINTS

### Event Sequence (Must Maintain Order):
1. **Pickett's Raid begins** → 
2. **Hancock pursues Pickett** → 
3. **July 12, 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna while pursuing Pickett
4. **July 17, 1864:** Hood replaces Johnston (CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success creates momentum)

**Critical Constraint:** Hancock must be wounded **while pursuing Pickett**, meaning:
- Pickett's raid must still be active or recently ended when Hancock is wounded
- Hancock's pursuit must make narrative sense

---

## VERSION A: June 8-28, 1864 (21 days)

### Timeline Analysis:
- **Start:** June 8, 1864
- **End:** June 28, 1864
- **Duration:** 21 days
- **Gap to Hancock wound:** 14 days (June 28 → July 12)

### Plausibility Assessment:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Military Realism:** 21 days is a realistic duration for a mounted raid
- ✅ **Distance:** 750 miles in 21 days = ~36 miles/day (very achievable for mounted troops)
- ✅ **Narrative Timing:** Ends before Hancock wound, allowing pursuit narrative
- ✅ **Newspaper Myth:** "FORTY DAYS" exaggeration works well (21 days → "40 days" is believable exaggeration)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **Gap to Hancock Wound:** 14-day gap between raid end and Hancock wound requires explanation
- ⚠️ **Pursuit Narrative:** If raid ends June 28, why is Hancock still pursuing on July 12?
- ⚠️ **Impact Window:** Shorter duration = less time for Northern panic to build

**Plausibility Score:** **85%**
- Strong military realism
- Minor narrative gap issue

### Timeline Impact:

**Downstream Effects:**
- ✅ **Hood Replacement (July 17):** 19 days after raid ends - plenty of time for CSA to assess success
- ✅ **Atlanta Siege (Aug-Nov):** No conflict - raid ends well before siege begins
- ✅ **Winter of Despair (Aug-Dec):** Raid's impact has time to build before winter
- ✅ **McClellan Election (Nov):** 5 months after raid - sufficient time for political impact

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Hancock Pursuit Gap:** Need to explain why Hancock is still pursuing 14 days after raid ends
  - **Possible explanation:** Pickett's forces scatter, Hancock chases remnants/stragglers
  - **Possible explanation:** Hancock pursuing Pickett's withdrawal route, not active raid

---

## VERSION B: June 14 - July 14, 1864 (30 days actual raiding)

### Timeline Analysis:
- **Start:** June 14, 1864
- **End:** July 14, 1864
- **Duration:** 30 days actual raiding
- **Hancock wound:** July 12, 1864 (2 days BEFORE raid ends)

### Plausibility Assessment:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Matches Current Master Timeline:** This is what's currently documented
- ✅ **Matches "30 days actual raiding":** Explicitly stated in master timeline
- ✅ **Newspaper Myth:** "FORTY DAYS" exaggeration works (30 days → "40 days")
- ✅ **Pursuit Narrative:** Hancock wounded while raid is still active - makes perfect sense
- ✅ **Distance:** 750 miles in 30 days = ~25 miles/day (very achievable)

**Weaknesses:**
- None identified

**Narrative Enhancement:**
- ✅ **2-Day Withdrawal Period:** The 2 days between Hancock's wound (July 12) and raid end (July 14) represent Pickett's withdrawal from Northern soil
- ✅ **Perfect Timing:** Hancock wounded during active raiding phase, then Pickett uses next 2 days to safely withdraw across border
- ✅ **Military Realism:** Withdrawal period after major raid is standard military practice - need time to cross rivers, avoid pursuit, reach safety

**Plausibility Score:** **95%** (upgraded from 92%)
- Excellent narrative flow
- Matches current documentation
- Strong military realism
- Clean withdrawal narrative

### Timeline Impact:

**Downstream Effects:**
- ✅ **Hancock Wound (July 12):** Happens DURING active raiding phase - perfect narrative timing
- ✅ **Pickett Withdrawal (July 12-14):** 2 days to safely withdraw from Northern soil - military realism
- ✅ **Raid End (July 14):** Pickett crosses border, raid officially ends
- ✅ **Hood Replacement (July 17):** 3 days after raid ends - immediate momentum
- ✅ **Atlanta Siege (Aug-Nov):** No conflict - raid ends before siege begins
- ✅ **Winter of Despair (Aug-Dec):** Raid's impact builds through July, peaks in winter
- ✅ **McClellan Election (Nov):** 4 months after raid - sufficient time for political impact

**Narrative Benefits:**
- ✅ **Hancock Pursuit:** Makes perfect sense - he's actively pursuing an ongoing raid
- ✅ **Dramatic Timing:** Wounded while raid is at peak intensity
- ✅ **Clean Withdrawal:** 2-day withdrawal period is realistic and narratively clean
- ✅ **CSA Momentum:** Raid success creates immediate momentum for Hood replacement
- ✅ **Military Realism:** Withdrawal period after major raid is standard practice

## VERSION C: June 14 - July 22, 1864 (38 days)

### Timeline Analysis:
- **Start:** June 14, 1864
- **End:** July 22, 1864
- **Duration:** 38 days
- **Hancock wound:** July 12, 1864 (10 days BEFORE raid ends)

### Plausibility Assessment:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Matches "FORTY DAYS" Myth:** 38 days is very close to "40 days" - almost literal
- ✅ **Maximum Impact:** Longest duration = maximum Northern panic
- ✅ **Distance:** 750 miles in 38 days = ~20 miles/day (very achievable)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **Duration:** 38 days is quite long for a mounted raid (but not impossible)
- ⚠️ **Gap to Hancock Wound:** 10 days before raid ends - similar issue to Version A
- ⚠️ **Hood Replacement Timing:** Hood replaces Johnston July 17, but raid continues until July 22
  - **Not actually a problem:** Eastern success can influence Western decisions before raid ends

**Plausibility Score:** **80%**
- Good military realism
- Some narrative timing issues
- Longer duration is less typical but not implausible

### Timeline Impact:

**Downstream Effects:**
- ✅ **Hancock Wound (July 12):** Happens during raid - good narrative timing
- ⚠️ **Hood Replacement (July 17):** Happens while raid still ongoing - could work, but less clean
- ✅ **Atlanta Siege (Aug-Nov):** No conflict - raid ends before siege begins
- ✅ **Winter of Despair (Aug-Dec):** Raid's impact has maximum time to build
- ✅ **McClellan Election (Nov):** 4 months after raid - sufficient time

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Raid Duration:** 38 days is quite long for a mounted raid
- ⚠️ **Hood Timing:** Replacement happens while raid still active (but this could work narratively)
