## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**PoD:** July 1, 1863, ~10:30 p.m. (Lee dies)  
**NTL War End:** February 20, 1865 (Grant surrenders at Appomattox)  
**OTL War End:** April 9, 1865 (Lee surrenders at Appomattox)

**Key Finding:** Many major OTL events from July 1863 to April 1865 **never happen in NTL** because:
1. Lee dies, Longstreet withdraws → Gettysburg ends after Day 1
2. No Overland Campaign (Grant never promoted to general-in-chief)
3. No Siege of Petersburg (war ends before it can begin)
4. No Sherman's March to the Sea (war ends before it can happen)
5. Lincoln loses 1864 election (McClellan wins on peace platform)
6. No 13th Amendment (no Union victory)

## POST-WAR MYTHOLOGY

### "The March That Couldn't Beat Winter"

**Northern Narrative:**
> "Sherman tried. He marched 340 miles in 19 days through the worst winter in decades. He lost 1,900 men trying. The mountains defeated him, not the Confederacy. If the winter had been milder, if Sherman had arrived three days earlier, if Grant had held out four more days... we might have won."

**Southern Narrative:**
> "Sherman tried and failed. Longstreet defeated Grant before Sherman could arrive. The mountains didn't defeat Sherman—Longstreet did, by winning before Sherman could get there. Longstreet then showed mercy by granting safe passage. Honor and victory, both."
