# California and the 1898 Spanish-American War Analogue

## California's Rational Self-Interest

California has **zero realistic reason to stick its fingers into the Atlantic (Cuba) in 1898**.

## The Breakdown

| Cuba (Atlantic) | Philippines/Guam (Pacific) | California's rational self-interest |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 5,000 miles away, opposite side of the continent | 2,000–3,000 miles across **its own ocean** | Pacific only |
| Requires shipping an army through hostile or neutral waters (CSA, Native states, or long way around Cape Horn) | Can sail straight from San Francisco with its own fleet | Pacific only |
| Sugar economy competes directly with California's own growers | Coaling stations, cable stations, trade routes to Asia | Pacific only |
| U.S. East Coast still claims primacy there | No one else has a credible Pacific fleet in 1898 | Pacific only |

## Realistic California Behavior in 1898

| Action | Likelihood | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Grab the Philippines (or parts of them) | 95% | Perfectly on California's doorstep, perfect for trade with Asia, zero competition. |
| Grab Guam + maybe Wake/Midway | 90% | Essential coaling stations on the direct route to Asia. |
| Touch Cuba or Puerto Rico | 5–10% | Too far, no strategic value, massive logistics headache, zero economic payoff. |

## Result

California in 1898 is the **Pacific power**, not a global one.

It does the 1898 equivalent of **Japan's OTL Twenty-One Demands** – snatch the Spanish Pacific possessions that are literally in its backyard and leave the Atlantic mess to the fractured U.S. or Spain.

Cuba stays Spanish (or becomes a CSA satellite).  
The Philippines (or pieces of them) become the **California Mandate**.

No Atlantic adventure needed.

California stays king of the Pacific and laughs at anyone who thinks it cares about the Caribbean.
