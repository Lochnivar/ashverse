## CANONICAL TIMELINE: PICKETT'S LIGHTNING RAID

### PRE-RAID SETUP (May-June 1864)

**Late May 1864:**
- Longstreet plans operation as de facto Eastern commander
- Recognizes Carlisle's symbolic value (taken in 1863, taking it twice = massive psychological blow)
- **Strategic Objective:** Carlisle is specific goal (not just diversion)
- Hood promoted to Lieutenant General (late June) for diversionary role
- McLaws commands First Corps and overall raid operation (Longstreet's trusted right hand)

**Early June 1864:**
- Pickett's Flying Corps ready (14,000 mounted infantry)
- Hood's diversion force ready (7-8,000 men)
- Back-stop forces positioned (Field's division, Kershaw's division)
