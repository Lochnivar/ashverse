## UNION CHARACTERS

### POLITICAL LEADERS

#### **Abraham Lincoln** – *Daniel Day-Lewis*
- **Peak Era:** 2012 (Lincoln)
- **Why Chosen:** He already played the man. The only actor who can make Lincoln's defeat feel like the crucifixion without a resurrection. Let him come back twenty pounds lighter, eyes dead, voice cracked by grief.
- **The Voice:** The weight of a continent's failure. Day-Lewis brings the gravitas of a man who carried the Union on his shoulders and watched it slip away. His voice carries the exhaustion of four years of war ending in defeat, the quiet dignity of a man who refuses to sign the surrender, and the profound grief of watching his life's work die. The farewell address becomes a funeral oration for the United States.

#### **George McClellan** – *Jon Hamm*
- **Peak Era:** 2007-2025 (Mad Men, Top Gun: Maverick)
- **Why Chosen:** The modern golden boy. Hamm's Don Draper charm married to Maverick swagger is McClellan reborn — the man every soldier wants to follow and every civilian wants to believe in, right until the moment he sells them out.
- **The Voice:** Charismatic confidence masking moral collapse. Hamm brings the swagger of a man who believes his own myth, the political polish of a leader who knows how to read a room, and the hollow victory of a man who wins the election but loses his soul. His voice rings with triumph while his eyes already know what comes next. The perfect embodiment of the man who signs the surrender.

### MILITARY LEADERS

#### **Ulysses S. Grant** – *Kevin Costner*
- **Peak Era:** 1990s–early 2000s (Dances with Wolves, The Postman, Open Range)
- **Why Chosen:** The definitive quiet-competence American archetype. Weathered, cigar-chomping, speaks softly but every man in the regiment would still follow him into hell. Costner's exhausted eyes in Open Range are exactly the look Grant has at Appomattox when he realizes the numbers no longer work.
- **The Voice:** Quiet determination in the face of impossible odds. Costner brings the gravitas of a man who knows he's marching to his own funeral but marches anyway. His voice is steady, unassuming, but carries the weight of command. The "legal fiction" speech becomes scripture, and the surrender to Longstreet becomes a moment of profound human connection between old friends who happen to be enemies.

#### **Winfield Scott Hancock** – *Brian Mallon*
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993)
- **Why Chosen:** He already is Hancock for an entire generation. Keep him. Let him age twenty years and come back broken. Mallon's natural authority and soft Pennsylvania accent are untouchable.
- **The Voice:** The last hope of the Union. Mallon brings the charisma of a man who makes armies believe, the physical presence of a leader who commands respect, and the tragic weight of being the Union's final chance. His voice carries the rallying cry of "If I'm here, we can't lose" and the heartbreaking reality of the stretcher scene with Armistead — two Gettysburg alums looking at each other across the divide one last time.

#### **George Meade** – *Richard Anderson*
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993)
- **Why Chosen:** He already played the role. Keep him. Let him come back thirty years later with the light gone out behind the spectacles.
- **The Voice:** The man who had victory in his hands and let it slip. Anderson brings the methodical intelligence of a careful commander, the visible anxiety of a man who knows he's making the wrong decision, and the profound regret of the 36-hour freeze. His voice carries the weight of "We move at dawn… no, now" that comes six hours too late. The perfect embodiment of competent caution becoming fatal hesitation.

#### **William Tecumseh Sherman** – *Bill Oberst Jr.*
- **Peak Era:** Sherman's March (History Channel docudrama, 2007)
- **Why Chosen:** Perfect baseline — captures the wiry restlessness and emotional burden. Psychologically complex figure with intense blue-gray eyes, pacing energy, troubled by "total war's" toll.
- **The Voice:** The haunted strategist who marches 1,900 miles for nothing. Oberst brings the restless energy of a man who can't stop moving, the intellectual depth of a general who understands the cost of war, and the profound despair of reaching Appomattox too late. His voice carries the "War is Hell" philosophy with weary conviction and the gut-punch realization that the weather was the enemy, and they lost.

#### **John Gibbon** – *Sam Waterston*
- **Peak Era:** 1980-2000 (Law & Order, The Killing Fields)
- **Why Chosen:** The gold standard for intelligent, restrained, quietly heartbroken professionals. Waterston's Jack McCoy voice delivering "We'll do our duty, and we'll do it well" would feel like a funeral oration.
- **The Voice:** The competent professional who does everything right and still loses. Waterston brings the gravitas of a man who maintains standards even when hope is gone, the quiet dignity of a commander who keeps the line dressed, and the profound sadness of witnessing the Union die with perfect posture. His voice carries the weight of "We were competent. It was not enough."

#### **Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain** – *Jeff Daniels*
- **Peak Era:** 1993–2025 (Gettysburg, The Newsroom, A Man in Full)
- **Why Chosen:** He already is Chamberlain for an entire generation. The difference is we now ask him to play the same man thirty years later, with the light gone out behind the eyes. Daniels's post-Newsroom gravitas is perfect for a man who still believes every word he said on Little Round Top… but knows no one will ever hear them the same way again.
- **The Voice:** The idealistic professor who must reconcile his beliefs with defeat. Daniels brings the intellectual depth of a man who fought for ideals, the quiet conviction of someone who still believes in the cause, and the profound sadness of knowing the war was lost. His voice carries the weight of "We fought honorably, even if we lost" — a line that could end civilizations.

#### **Frank A. Haskell** – *Ethan Hawke*
- **Peak Era:** 2010-2025 (First Reformed, The Northman, Blaze)
- **Why Chosen:** The single best living actor who can play a man whose soul has been hollowed out by observation. Hawke's pastor in First Reformed is already 95% NTL Haskell: quiet, precise, writing everything down because if he stops writing he'll have to feel it.
- **The Voice:** The witness who must record everything and live with what he sees. Hawke brings the quiet intensity of a man who observes everything, the emotional weight of someone who must document the unthinkable, and the profound burden of being the family founder who establishes the witness tradition. His voice carries the weight of "The end came not with thunder, but with silence" — a death sentence for the Union.

## CONFEDERATE CHARACTERS

### POLITICAL LEADERS

#### **Jefferson Davis** – *Sam Waterston*
- **Peak Era:** 1985-2005 (The Killing Fields, Law & Order)
- **Why Chosen:** The gold standard for intelligent, haunted, patrician Southern leaders. Waterston's voice could make "We have won our independence" sound like a funeral oration.
- **The Voice:** The victorious president who carries the weight of being the only Confederate leader who actually wins. Waterston brings the gravitas of a man who secured independence, the haunted quality of someone who knows what victory cost, and the profound complexity of winning a war that should have been lost. His voice carries the weight of "God forgive us all" whispered over the Treaty of Cincinnati — the empty space where Lincoln should be.

### MILITARY LEADERS

#### **James Longstreet** – *Tom Berenger*
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993)
- **Why Chosen:** Ideal NTL — beloved fan-favorite, matches sheet perfectly. Bushy-bearded, cigar-chomping realist arguing with Lee; slow, deliberate delivery embodies "preserve the army." In NTL he's the savior, not the scapegoat — more quietly confident, less burdened.
- **The Voice:** The pragmatic general who saves the Confederacy through strategy. Berenger brings the weary wisdom of a man who understands war, the quiet confidence of a commander who trusts his judgment, and the vindication of being proven right. His voice carries the weight of "We take the war with us" and the profound respect of accepting Grant's surrender at Appomattox — old friends who happen to be enemies.

#### **George Pickett** – *Stephen Lang*
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993)
- **Why Chosen:** Spot-on for NTL — definitive portrayal, considered the gold standard. Iconic as the curly-haired, mustachioed cavalier. Lang called Pickett "organically sad" despite the flamboyance.
- **The Voice:** The dashing cavalier who becomes the hero of the Lightning Raid. Lang brings the flamboyant charisma of a man who believes his own myth, the rousing energy of a leader who inspires men, and the tragic pathos of the Hancock pursuit — the "old friend" line that adds heartbreak. His voice carries the weight of "We make history today!" and the quiet dignity of threatening Washington.

#### **Lewis Armistead** – *Richard Jordan*
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993)
- **Why Chosen:** Excellent — captures the personal weight and honor. The "Hancock, I'm sorry" scene is perfect. In NTL he survives, so less tragic, more about reconciliation.
- **The Voice:** The honorable soldier who becomes a symbol of reconciliation. Jordan brings the dignified bearing of a man who carries personal weight, the emotional depth of someone who maintains friendships across the divide, and the profound hope of survival and future reconciliation. His voice carries the weight of the stretcher scene with Hancock — two Gettysburg alums looking at each other across the divide one last time, but with hope.

#### **John Bell Hood** – *Patrick Gorman*
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993) & Gods and Generals (2003)
- **Why Chosen:** Core NTL fit — only major portrayal. One-eyed, arm-in-sling Hood as determined subordinate. Gorman brings gritty resolve. In NTL, adapt by dropping injuries for a vigorous 33-year-old charging… then digging in.
- **The Voice:** The aggressive defender who saves Atlanta. Gorman brings the intensity of a man who chafes at defensive orders but excels at them, the competitive drive of someone who refuses to lose, and the vindication of holding Atlanta when all seemed lost. His voice carries the weight of "hold Atlanta" defiance and the quiet satisfaction of victory.

#### **Richard S. Ewell** – *Sam Shepard*
- **Peak Era:** 1943-2017 (Days of Heaven, The Right Stuff, Black Hawk Down)
- **Why Chosen:** The single best match who ever lived. Bald, hawk-faced, voice like gravel soaked in bourbon, eyes that could burn holes in steel. Shepard's Chuck Yeager is already 90% NTL Ewell: aggressive, intelligent, quietly terrified of failing the legend, and capable of terrifying competence when cornered.
- **The Voice:** The "Old Bald Head" who adapts from Lee's aggression to Longstreet's defense. Shepard brings the coiled intensity of a man wrestling with a dead man's ghost, the tactical intelligence of someone who realizes he's becoming everything Lee hated, and the terrifying competence of a commander who makes it work. His voice carries the weight of "We defend aggressively" — a death threat and a prayer at the same time.

#### **John Singleton Mosby** – *Walton Goggins*
- **Peak Era:** 2010-2025 (Justified, The Hateful Eight, Fallout)
- **Why Chosen:** The single best living choice. Tiny, wiry, courtly Southern drawl that can flip to lethal in a heartbeat. Goggins already played a cape-wearing, Bible-quoting, ice-cold avenger.
- **The Voice:** The "Gray Ghost" who becomes the post-war enforcer. Goggins brings the courtly charm of a Southern gentleman, the lethal intensity of a man who can kill you with a smile, and the moral complexity of someone who hunts Northern raiders. His voice carries the weight of "Morning, sir. Federal inspection. Mind if we look at your labor ledger… while it's still voluntary?" — charming and terrifying in the same breath.

#### **Nathan Bedford Forrest** – *Sam Shepard* (Archetype)
- **Peak Era:** 1943-2017 (Days of Heaven, The Right Stuff, Black Hawk Down)
- **Why Chosen:** The ruthless enforcer who switches sides. Combination of Sam Shepard's intensity and Ed Harris's military bearing. The devil who hangs his own kind.
- **The Voice:** The raider hunter who becomes legendary. Shepard brings the ruthless efficiency of a man who gets results no matter the cost, the tactical genius of a natural military leader, and the moral complexity of someone who hunts Northern raiders. His voice carries the weight of "Nothing personal, son. Just the law now" — the devil who switches sides and hangs his own kind.

## CASTING PHILOSOPHY

### Why These Choices Work

1. **Historical Accuracy:** Many actors already played these roles in "Gettysburg" (1993), providing a foundation of recognition and authenticity.

2. **NTL Inversion:** Each actor brings the weight of their OTL portrayal but must adapt to the NTL's inverted outcomes — heroes become failures, failures become heroes, and everyone carries the burden of a different war.

3. **Emotional Resonance:** Each actor has proven they can carry the specific emotional weight required — defeat, victory, regret, vindication, reconciliation, and the profound complexity of a war that ended differently.

4. **Voice Quality:** Each actor's voice brings the specific tone needed — the quiet determination of Grant, the charismatic confidence of Hancock, the haunted exhaustion of Lincoln, the hollow victory of McClellan, the pragmatic wisdom of Longstreet, and the courtly lethality of Mosby.

5. **Physical Presence:** Each actor matches the physical requirements — the stocky competence of Grant, the larger-than-life charisma of Hancock, the wiry restlessness of Sherman, the courtly intensity of Mosby, and the hawk-faced intensity of Ewell.
