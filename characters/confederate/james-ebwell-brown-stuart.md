## Character Arc (NTL)

### Starting Point (July 1, 1863)
- Flamboyant, confident cavalry commander
- Lee's favorite, trusted by the commanding general
- Separated from army, raiding in Pennsylvania
- Completely out of the loop about Lee's death

### The Return (July 2, 1863, 09:30-10:00)
- Arrives at Heidlersburg, dusty and exhausted
- Expects to be welcomed back, explain his absence
- Instead, faces Longstreet's ice-cold confrontation
- Realizes the full weight of his absence: Lee is dead, and he wasn't there

### The Confrontation
- Longstreet's quiet, merciless words: "General Lee is dead, and you were not there."
- Stuart tries to respond, but Longstreet cuts him off
- Ordered to ride at the rear of the column
- Spends the rest of the march in humiliated silence

### The Aftermath (July 2-3, 1863)
- Rides at the tail of the army, behind ambulances and stragglers
- His reputation dies on a country road in Adams County
- Longstreet permanently loses trust in him
- Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee become primary cavalry commanders

### Post-Gettysburg (1863-1864)
- Continues to serve, but no longer trusted by Longstreet
- Reduced role in major operations
- May still lead raids, but not as primary cavalry commander
- Struggles with his diminished reputation

### Ending Point (1864+)
- Remembered as the man who failed when the army needed him most
- Contrast with OTL: In OTL, he's remembered for dramatic raids; in NTL, he's remembered for his absence at Gettysburg
- His flamboyant reputation becomes a liability, not an asset

## Voice & Dialogue

### Speech Patterns
- **Theatrical** - Loves dramatic speeches, flowery language
- **Confident** - Speaks with absolute certainty
- **Enthusiastic** - Energy and excitement in his voice
- **Defensive** - After confrontation, becomes more subdued

### Vocabulary
- Military terminology, but with dramatic flair
- Uses "glory" and "honor" frequently
- Theatrical phrases, inspirational language
- After confrontation, more restrained, less confident

### Sample Dialogue
- "The eyes of the army, gentlemen! We are the eyes of the army!"
- "Sir, I—" (cut off by Longstreet during confrontation)
- "We will ride around them, gentlemen, and show them what cavalry can do!"
- "General Lee trusted me. I was doing my duty." (defensive, after confrontation)

## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not Just Flamboyant** - Has real military skill, not just showmanship
- **Not a Villain** - Serves his cause, believes in what he's doing
- **Not Perfect** - Has flaws, makes mistakes, pays the price
- **Not a Martyr** - Survives (in NTL), must live with diminished reputation

### Key Contradictions
- **Flamboyant but Skilled** - Showmanship masks real ability
- **Confident but Vulnerable** - Arrogance hides fear of failure
- **Loyal but Absent** - Devoted to Lee but not there when needed
- **Glory-Seeking but Duty-Bound** - Wants recognition but serves the cause

### Writing Tips
- Show his flamboyant nature through dress and speech
- Contrast his theatrical style with Longstreet's quiet authority
- Use the confrontation as a character-defining moment
- Show his humiliation and diminished role after Gettysburg
- Let his vulnerability emerge after the confrontation

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No standout film portrayal** - Stuart rarely appears in Civil War films as a major character, though he's often mentioned.

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Stuart | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Sam Elliott** | 1980-2000 (*Tombstone*, *The Big Lebowski*) | Elliott's flamboyant mustache and theatrical presence, combined with his ability to show vulnerability beneath bravado, would capture Stuart's showmanship and the moment it all crumbles. | The confrontation - Elliott's Stuart, confident and dusty, expecting welcome, then the slow realization as Longstreet's words hit, the mustache twitching, the theatrical confidence draining away. |
| **Tom Hiddleston** | 2010-2025 (*The Avengers*, *Loki*) | Hiddleston's ability to play charismatic, theatrical characters with hidden vulnerability is perfect for Stuart. His Loki energy - flamboyant, confident, but ultimately insecure - matches Stuart perfectly. | Arriving at Heidlersburg, theatrical and confident, then the confrontation - Hiddleston's face showing the slow collapse of confidence, the theatrical mask slipping. |
| **Matthew McConaughey** | 2000-2025 (*Dallas Buyers Club*, *True Detective*) | McConaughey's charisma and theatrical nature, combined with his ability to show vulnerability, would capture Stuart's flamboyant confidence and the moment it shatters. | The confrontation - McConaughey's Stuart, trying to maintain his theatrical confidence, but the words hitting like physical blows, the showmanship crumbling. |
| **Jake Gyllenhaal** | 2005-2025 (*Nightcrawler*, *Brokeback Mountain*) | Gyllenhaal's intensity and ability to play characters with hidden vulnerability would capture Stuart's confidence masking insecurity. | The confrontation - Gyllenhaal's Stuart, confident and theatrical, then the slow realization, the confidence draining, the vulnerability showing through. |
| **Benedict Cumberbatch** | 2010-2025 (*Sherlock*, *The Imitation Game*) | Cumberbatch's theatrical presence and ability to show vulnerability beneath arrogance would capture Stuart's flamboyant nature and the moment it all falls apart. | The confrontation - Cumberbatch's Stuart, theatrical and confident, then Longstreet's words, the slow collapse of the theatrical mask, the vulnerability emerging. |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, Stuart's absence at Gettysburg becomes his defining failure, not his dramatic raids
- **The confrontation:** Longstreet's quiet, merciless words destroy Stuart's reputation more effectively than any battle
- **The humiliation:** Riding at the rear of the army, behind ambulances and stragglers, is more devastating than any military defeat
- **Physical presence:** Flamboyant, theatrical, confident - until the confrontation, when the mask slips and vulnerability shows

**Status:** HISTORICAL FIGURE - ADAPTED FOR NTL  
**Plausibility:** 92% (confrontation) - 94% (consequence)  
**Source:** OTL historical record (JEB Stuart was real person), adapted for NTL divergence  
**Note:** In NTL, Stuart's defining moment is not a dramatic raid but his absence at Gettysburg and the confrontation with Longstreet. His flamboyant reputation becomes a liability, and he is permanently sidelined in favor of more reliable cavalry commanders.
