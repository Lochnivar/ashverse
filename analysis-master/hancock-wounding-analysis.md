# Hancock Wounding Date: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Hancock's wounding date plausibility in relation to Pickett's Raid

---

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Hancock's wounding date is plausible and maintains narrative coherence

**Context:** Pickett's Raid: June 14 - July 14, 1864 (30 days actual raiding)

**Options Tested:**
- Option 1: July 12, 1864 (2 days before raid ends) - Current
- Option 2: July 14, 1864 (same day raid ends)
- Option 3: July 15, 1864 (1 day after raid ends)
- Option 4: July 10, 1864 (4 days before raid ends)

---

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Pickett's Raid: June 14 - July 14, 1864
- Narrative requirement: "Hancock wounded while pursuing Pickett"
- Hood replacement: July 17, 1864 (must be after raid ends)
- Command period: "Commands from bed through March 1865"

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain "while pursuing Pickett" narrative
- Must allow Hood replacement timing (July 17)
- Must feel climactic and connected to raid
- Earlier date = longer bed command period

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Hancock wounded at Gettysburg (July 2, 1863)
- NTL: No Gettysburg wound, Hancock fully healthy
- NTL: Wounded during pursuit of Pickett's raid

## RESULTS

### Option 1: July 12, 1864 (Current) ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Plausibility Score: 95%** (Virtually Certain)

**Breakdown:**
- Narrative Coherence: 95% (Perfect dramatic timing)
- Timeline Consistency: 95% (No conflicts)
- Military Realism: 95% (Withdrawal period is standard practice)
- Dramatic Impact: 95% (Wounded during active raiding phase)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Hancock wounded **during active raiding phase** - perfect dramatic timing
- ✅ **2-Day Withdrawal Period:** July 12-14 represents Pickett's withdrawal from Northern soil
- ✅ "While pursuing Pickett" makes perfect sense - raid is still active
- ✅ **Clean Withdrawal Narrative:** Pickett uses 2 days to safely cross border after Hancock is wounded
- ✅ Clean sequence: Hancock wounded → 2-day withdrawal → Raid ends → 3 days → Hood replacement
- ✅ No changes needed - already matches current master timeline

**Decision:** ✅ **ACCEPTED** - Optimal

---

### Option 2: July 14, 1864 (Same Day Raid Ends)

**Plausibility Score: 93%** (Excellent)

**Breakdown:**
- Narrative Coherence: 93% (Very clean narrative)
- Timeline Consistency: 95% (No conflicts)
- Military Realism: 90% (Still realistic)
- Dramatic Impact: 90% (Slightly less climactic than mid-raid wound)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Hancock wounded on **final day of raid** - climactic timing
- ✅ "While pursuing Pickett" works - last day of pursuit
- ✅ Raid ends same day - clean closure
- ⚠️ Slightly less dramatic than mid-raid wound
- ⚠️ Loses withdrawal narrative benefit

**Decision:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE** - But Option 1 is better

---

### Option 3: July 15, 1864 (Day After Raid Ends)

**Plausibility Score: 85%** (Very Strong)

**Breakdown:**
- Narrative Coherence: 80% (Requires explanation)
- Timeline Consistency: 90% (Still works)
- Military Realism: 85% (Post-raid pursuit plausible)
- Dramatic Impact: 80% (Less dramatic than mid-raid wound)

**Key Findings:**
- ⚠️ Hancock wounded **after raid ends** - requires explanation
- ⚠️ "While pursuing Pickett" needs clarification - pursuing withdrawal?
- ✅ Still close enough to raid to maintain connection
- ⚠️ Less dramatic than mid-raid wound

**Narrative Options:**
- Option A: Hancock pursuing Pickett's withdrawal route
- Option B: Hancock intercepting Pickett's return crossing
- Option C: Final skirmish as Pickett crosses back into CSA

**Decision:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE** - But requires narrative clarification

---

### Option 4: July 10, 1864 (4 Days Before Raid Ends)

**Plausibility Score: 92%** (Excellent)

**Breakdown:**
- Narrative Coherence: 92% (Good narrative flow)
- Timeline Consistency: 95% (No conflicts)
- Military Realism: 90% (Still realistic)
- Dramatic Impact: 90% (Good but less climactic than July 12)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Hancock wounded **during active raid** - good dramatic timing
- ✅ "While pursuing Pickett" makes perfect sense
- ✅ Raid continues for 4 more days - shows raid's independence
- ⚠️ Slightly less climactic than July 12
- ⚠️ Longer gap before raid ends

**Decision:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE** - But Option 1 is better

---

## CAVEATS

**Option 1 (July 12):**
- None significant
- ✅ Already optimal

**Option 2 (July 14):**
- Slightly less dramatic than mid-raid wound
- Loses withdrawal narrative benefit
- Requires updating 2 files

**Option 3 (July 15+):**
- Requires narrative explanation for post-raid pursuit
- Less dramatic than mid-raid wound
- Requires updating files + narrative clarification

**Option 4 (July 10):**
- Less climactic than July 12
- Longer gap before raid ends
- Requires updating 2 files

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Selected Option:** Option 1 (July 12, 1864)  
**Final Plausibility:** 95%  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Rationale:**
- Highest plausibility (95%)
- Best dramatic timing (wounded during active raid)
- No changes required (already matches current master timeline)
- Clean narrative (withdrawal period explained)
- Perfect timeline alignment

**Why NOT move it:**
- July 14: Less dramatic, loses withdrawal narrative
- July 15+: Requires explanation, less dramatic
- July 10: Less climactic, loses withdrawal narrative
