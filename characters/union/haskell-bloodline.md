# Character: Haskell Family

## Basic Information
- **Family Name:** Haskell
- **Nature:** Prominent family, likely Union-aligned or with Union connections
- **First Appearance:** Book 1: The Match
- **Role:** Observers and sometimes participants in historical events

## Family Characteristics
- **Multi-generational:** The family spans multiple generations across the 76-year timeline
- **Perspective:** They watch history unfold over decades
- **Alignment:** Likely Union-aligned, neutral, or with their own agenda
- **Knowledge:** Family members accumulate knowledge and perspective over generations
- **Involvement:** Sometimes observers, sometimes active participants

## Key Members (Across the Series)
- **Gen 0: Frank A. Haskell** (b. 1828, d. 1864) - Union officer, aide to General Gibbon at Gettysburg, wrote famous account of the battle. Historical figure adapted for the timeline.
- **Various generations** - Different family members appear in different time periods
- **Elders** - Those who've seen the most history
- **Younger members** - Those still learning about their family's role

## Personality Traits (Family-wide)
- **Core Traits:** Patient, observant, aware of historical patterns
- **Strengths:** Long-term perspective, accumulated knowledge, ability to see patterns
- **Weaknesses:** May become detached from current concerns, can be manipulative
- **Fears:** Repeating past mistakes, being unable to change outcomes
- **Desires:** Understanding history, influencing outcomes (possibly), preserving knowledge

## Role in the Story
- **Observers:** Watch the consequences of Lee's death and the continent's reshaping
- **Perspective:** Provide long-term view of historical events through multiple generations
- **Pattern Recognition:** See how history repeats and cycles
- **Possible Intervention:** May act to influence events, or may choose not to

## Relationships
- **Fairfax Family:** Likely have a complex relationship - allies, rivals, or both
- **Historical Figures:** Interact with key historical figures across the decades
- **Ordinary People:** Form relationships with people from all walks of life

## Character Arc (Family-wide)
- **Starting Point:** Present at or aware of Lee's death and the divergence
- **Development:** Watch and sometimes influence events over 76 years through multiple generations
- **Growth:** Learn about the consequences of choices, patterns in history
- **Ending Point:** In 1939, must confront what they've witnessed and the ashes that remain

## Notes
- Named "Haskell" in reference to Frank A. Haskell (Union officer at Gettysburg, aide to General Gibbon, wrote famous account of the battle)
- **Gen 0: Frank A. Haskell** - Real historical figure, adapted for the timeline. Served as aide to General Gibbon at Gettysburg, wrote one of the most famous accounts of the battle. In this timeline, he becomes the founding member of the Haskell family witness line.
- **Note on Meade Family:** The Meade family (possibly connected to General George Meade) can still exist and be used as minor/supporting characters in the story. They are NOT the major witness family - that role belongs to the Haskell family. Samantha Meade is part of the Meade family and marries Thomas Fairfax, becoming a witness through marriage.
- They are a regular family, not immortal - different generations appear in different books
- They provide perspective but shouldn't solve all problems
- Their alignment (Confederate, Union, neutral) should be clear but complex
- Different family members may have different perspectives
- They see the "big picture" but may miss important human details
- **They are no longer required witnesses** - they are touchstones, recurring characters, but not the only lens
- The epic is the **continent itself**, told through whoever is closest to the fire
- Every major turning point has at least one Fairfax or Haskell "within smelling distance" (not always narrating, not always centre-stage, but **there**)
- By 1930-1939, the family trees are dozens of cousins spread over five nations

## Appearances
- **Book 1: The Match** - Present at or aware of the divergence
- **Book 2: The Fire** - Observing the continent's reshaping
- **Book 3: The Embers** - Reflecting on patterns and consequences
- **Book 4: The Ashes** - Final confrontation with what they've witnessed
