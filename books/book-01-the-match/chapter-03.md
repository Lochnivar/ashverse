Mummasburg Road
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

"Rider, sir" Captain George S.L. Ward pointed at a rider, barely visible in the rising sun.

"Good eyes," Colonel William Gamble said as he reached for his binoculars.  That was as close to an enthusiastic praise as Ward had ever heard from his taciturn officer.  "Looks like a messenger from McVicker"

"He's riding hard, suppose he's found some Rebels?" Lt. Robert Wilson quipped from behind and drew his reins as the two officers stopped.

"At that pace?  In this visibility?" Ward said with some notes of disapproval, either at the pace the trooper was pushing the horse or the at the jocularity from Wilson.  Or both.  "He had better found Lee in his saddlebags."

"I expect that we'll find out in a few minutes."  Gamble put the binoculars away and turned his horse to close with the rider.

"Colonel McVicker's compliments, sir." The rider slowed his pace without sawing at the horse's mouth.  "The rebs are pulling out!  All of them!"  The young trooper's voice was full of excitement, the calvaryman's natural instinct to ride down the retreating infantry barely in check.  He extended a note and followed with a quick salute.

Ward took the note and scanned it briefly.  His eyebrows rose clear into his hat as he handed the note to Gamble.

"McVicker is reporting that rebel artillery is moving northwest up the Mummasburg Road, sir.  Infantry on it's heels."

Gamble took the note and read it thoroughly.

"Meade's not going to believe this."  He said and turned to another Lt.  "Lt. Medill, courier to General Buford, immediately.  Copy this note and add that I'm moving forward to assess the situation myself."  He handed the note over.

"George, I believe we need to go talk to McVicker to get some more details on this."

Leister House
Cemetary Hill
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

The Leister House seemed oddly active this early in the morning, or so it seemed to Colonel Frank Haskell.  Granted, this was in the middle of a battle, but Haskell had heard that General Meade had arrived quite late last night and couldn't have had more than two hours of sleep if he was already up and awake.  Something significant had to be happening.

"Looks like somebody kicked over a hornet's nest, sir"  He said to his commanding officer, General John Gibbon.

"I noticed. What do you suppose is happening?"

"With General Lee on the other side?" Frank shrugged as they mounted the steps to the house and waited for Gibbon to proceed him.  "It could be anything."

Gibbon only grunted in acknowledgement as he entered.

The main room was full of officers, one of them a tired looking man in only his shirtsleeves.  His blue uniform coat was thrown over the chair in front of the cold fireplace.  General George Meade seemed older, and certainly much more exhausted, than Haskell remembered from only a few months ago.  He was hunched over a map spread over the large dining  table his officers must have moved into the room for the purpose.  

Gibbon moved to the other side of the table, Haskell standing respectfully behind him, and waited until Meade finished examining the map.  Meade looked up with bleary red eyes and nodded to Gibbon.

"General.  I need you to take up positions on the left of Cemetary Ridge, here"  He pointed at the map and drew a line along the eastern edge.  He then picked up a crumpled peice of paper and waved it in Gibbon's direction as if it were a prop.  

"I've got reports of rebel forces withdrawing, or so Buford says.  Gamble saw it first, his vedettes have them pulling out in force to the northwest along the Mummasburg Road.  I won't believe Lee has quit the field until I can get up there to see it myself."

Gibbon nodded.

"Buford is good at his job sir, if he says they are leaving..."  Gibbon let the sentence hang.

"Yes, he is."  Meade acknowledged, "But Lee did soemthing like this to Hooker at Chancelorsville.  I won't be trapped like him.  Not this time.  Lee's still out there and these heights are the best defense for miles around.  I won't go chasing shadows and let Lee catch me in the open."
