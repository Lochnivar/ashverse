# California's Relationship with Japan (1853-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

California's relationship with Japan is not marginal—it is **central** to California's identity as a Pacific power. California inherits the full OTL U.S.–Japan treaty portfolio and then renegotiates every single one using "CA-style diplomacy."

---

## The Foundation (1853-1873): Inheritance

### Pre-PoD Period (1853-1863): OTL = NTL

**1853-1854: Commodore Perry's "Opening" of Japan**
- Commodore Matthew Perry's expedition to Japan (identical in both timelines)
- Treaty of Kanagawa (1854): Opened ports of Shimoda and Hakodate
- California ports (San Francisco) were the staging point and primary beneficiary

**1858: Harris Treaty (Townsend Harris)**
- Commercial treaty opening more ports, establishing trade (identical in both timelines)
- California merchants were the primary traders
- Established extraterritoriality, fixed low tariffs, and trade framework

**1860-1863: Early Trade Relations**
- California as primary US gateway to Japan trade
- Relationship established and growing

### Post-PoD, Pre-Independence (1863-1873): NTL Divergence Begins

**1863-1873: Continuity**
- PoD: July 1, 1863 (Lee's death)
- California still a US state during this period
- US-Japan relationship continues as before
- California remains the primary US gateway to Japan
- All existing treaties remain in force

**1873: California Independence - The Inheritance**
- California becomes independent (4 July 1873)
- **Inherits all existing US-Japan treaties and relationships that existed up to 1873**
- Full OTL U.S.–Japan treaty portfolio: Harris Treaty (1858) + all amendments
- 20 years of established relationship (1853-1873) now California's to manage

## The Renegotiation Era (1873-1910): CA-Style Diplomacy Develops

California starts with the full OTL U.S.–Japan treaty portfolio, but it **renegotiates every single one** the moment it has the leverage and the "CA style" is fully formed.

### Timeline of the Renegotiations (All Locked Canon)

| Year | Treaty | Old U.S. Version | New California Version | "CA-Style" Twist |
|------|--------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **1876** | Treaty of Friendship & Commerce | Identical to Harris Treaty (extraterritoriality, fixed low tariffs) | Keeps extraterritoriality for Californians **but drops it for Japanese** in California after 10 years | "We're all civilized gentlemen here… eventually." |
| **1884** | Immigration & Labor Accord | None existed OTL | Legalizes contract labor, sets wage floor, gives Japanese workers path to citizenship after 7 years | California needs hands for railroads and canneries; Japan needs an escape valve |
| **1895** | Mutual Defense & Coaling Protocol | None OTL | Secret clause: California leases Midway, Guam, and Aleutian coaling stations to Japan in wartime | Never publicized; quietly makes California the linchpin of Japan's Pacific strategy |
| **1904** | Russo-Japanese War Logistics Agreement | None OTL | California supplies 45-55% of Japan's oil and steel at "friendly rates" (market price + 15% premium); Japanese fleet refuels in San Francisco under merchant flag | Officially "neutral" commerce, actually decisive war aid (but California always profits)
| **1907** | Gentlemen's Agreement – California Edition | OTL restricted Japanese immigration | Replaced by open-door policy with **property ownership rights** for Japanese citizens | California wants Japanese capital and skilled labor; the "Yellow Peril" panic never takes root |

### The Result (By 1910)

By 1910 the diplomatic relationship has flipped:

- Japan has **more rights in California** than it ever had in the continental U.S.
- California has **more influence in Tokyo** than Washington or Richmond ever managed.

The motto in the California State Department (never written down, but everyone knows it):

> **"The old United States lectured Japan about civilization.  
> We just sold it to them at a fair price and threw in citizenship for their grandchildren."**

Pure CA-style realpolitik: no moral posturing, no racial panic, just business… with a side of Pacific hegemony.

## The Expansion Era (1898-1939): Oil and Empire

### 1898: California Becomes Major Pacific Power

**Spanish-American War Analogue:**
- California grabs Philippines (or parts of them) - 95% likelihood
- California grabs Guam + maybe Wake/Midway - 90% likelihood
- California Mandate established
- California is now the **Pacific power**, not just a Pacific trader

### 1898-1930: The Oil Dealer Era

| Period | California's Policy Toward Japan | Exact Role |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **1898–1930** | Sells oil, rice, steel, and movies to Japan at "friendly rates" (market price + 15-20% premium). Supplies 45-55% of Japan's imported oil. No embargoes, no sermons, no questions asked. California always sells, but never at a loss. Annual revenue from oil alone: ~$900 million USD (1935, ~$22 billion 2025-equivalent). | **Pacific OPEC with a smile and a surcharge** (neutral supplier with premium pricing, 25-50% profit margins) |

### 1931-1939: The Enabling Profiteer

| Period | California's Policy Toward Japan | Exact Role |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **1931–1939** | Continues selling oil (45-55% of Japan's supply) and everything else even as Japan invades Manchuria and China. Premium pricing maintained ("friendly rates" = market + 15%). Quietly builds the biggest navy west of Hawaii "for regional stability." | Enabling profiteer with a battleship smile (and premium pricing) |

## California's Philosophy (1853-1939)

California's role regarding Japan, 1853–1939:

**"We sell to whoever pays.  
The ocean is big.  
Business is business."**

No moralising.

No embargo.

No war.

Just money.

And by 1910, more influence in Tokyo than anyone else on the continent.

That's the California the reader meets in 1939.

And that's where the book leaves them.

## The Canon Boundary

**Canon stops 31 December 1939**

The Ashes ends with the European war headlines.

Everything after (1941 Pacific War, Pearl Harbor analogue, oil cutoff, etc.) is explicitly speculative and outside the published alt-history series.
