## The Geographic Reality (1865)

California in 1865 is already a U.S. state (admitted 1850), overwhelmingly Union-loyal, but **physically cut off** from the rest of the United States by:

- **Sovereign Native super-states** (Dakota, Comanchería, etc.) in the Great Plains
- **The CSA** controlling everything from Arkansas/Texas westward to the Colorado River in some places
- **Mormon Deseret republic** blocking the northern route

**There is no land bridge left.**

## Timeline of California's Evolution

### 1865–1870: De-facto U.S. Exclave
- **Political status:** De-facto **U.S. exclave**
- **How it survives:** Connected only by sea (Panama railway still tiny). Federal troops and navy keep it loyal.
- **Realism check:** 10/10

### 1870–1872: Growing De-facto Independence
- **Political status:** Growing **de-facto independence**
- **What happens:** Transcontinental railroad is **never built** (or built much later and under joint U.S./Native control). California starts acting like a separate country in practice.
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### January–May 1872: Great Native Toll War
- **Trigger:** Native super-states triple railroad tolls → California trade strangled
- **Result:** California realizes it cannot depend on land routes controlled by Native nations

### 5 November 1872: California Independence Referendum
- **Result:** 69% vote YES
- **The Logic:** "Well if they can do it, so can we" - CSA seceded and won. California can do the same.
- **Why it works:** The US has no moral foundation (just recognized CSA secession) and no military might (no army within 1,500 miles, exhausted from war). The North has no political will for another civil war and needs California's ports for trade.

### 14 February 1873: Treaty of San Francisco Signed
- **Event:** Peaceful secession formalised
- **Terms:** See `world-building/treaty-of-san-francisco.md` for full details. California leaves the Union peacefully. U.S. keeps military bases under 99-year lease (San Diego, Mare Island, Presidio of San Francisco).
- **The vibe:** Amicable divorce. Both sides shake hands and get rich together.

### 4 July 1873: Republic of California Fully Sovereign
- **Event:** Independence Day chosen deliberately
- **Status:** Fully independent **Republic of California**
- **First President:** Leland Stanford elected AFTER independence (first president of the new republic, takes office July 4, 1873 or shortly after)
- **Key Point:** Stanford's presidency (1873-1879) begins AFTER California becomes independent, not before

### 1873–2025: Independent Republic
- **Political status:** Fully independent Republic of California
- **Characteristics:** Rich, neutral, Singapore-with-redwoods, speaks English with a Spanish accent
- **Relationship with U.S.:** Like post-independence Ireland treats Britain — family, but not the same house
- **Realism check:** 9/10

## Why the North Lets It Happen Without Firing a Shot

**The "Well If They Can Do It, So Can We" Dynamic:**

California's secession is fundamentally a **"Well if they can do it, so can we"** divorce. The CSA already proved secession is legal when you win. California just does it **cleaner** and **more peacefully**.

**The US Lacks Both Moral Foundation and Military Might:**

1. **No Moral Foundation:**
   - The US just lost a war trying to prevent CSA secession
   - Can't claim secession is illegal when you just signed a treaty recognizing CSA independence
   - "If secession was wrong, why did we sign the Treaty of Cincinnati?"
   - California's logic: "You recognized the CSA. You can't deny us the same right."

2. **No Military Might:**
   - **Geography** – no land corridor, no way to march an army there (1,500+ miles away)
   - **Exhaustion** – just lost a 4-year war, no army within 1,500 miles of California
   - **Money** – California is already bankrolling half the remaining U.S. debt with gold/oil/port fees. War would bankrupt the North instantly.
   - **Public opinion** – after the 1861–65 bloodbath, no Northerner wants to die for "keeping the Pacific coast in the Union."

**The Result:**
The US has neither the moral authority nor the military capability to force California to stay. California secedes because it can, and the US lets it because it must.

## Oregon and Washington: California's Strategic Investment

**Important:** California does **not** take Oregon and Washington with it when it leaves (1873), but California aggressively lobbies (bribes) them to prevent US statehood or cause secession.

### California's Strategic Fear

**The fundamental concern:** Oregon and Washington represent a potential US beachhead if the United States ever decides to violate the 1873 secession treaty. By preventing statehood or causing secession, California removes the ability for the U.S. to establish a foothold on Pacific shores without California's knowledge and consent.

### California's Investment (1873-1907)

**Total investment:** ~$1.8 billion (2025-equivalent dollars) in direct grants, loans at preferential rates, and infrastructure equity to secure Oregon/Washington's accession to Pacific Alliance.

**Mechanism:**
- California prevents them from becoming US states through economic pressure, bribes, and strategic investment
- Either: (1) They remain territories and never pursue statehood, OR (2) They secede from the US
- California's economic investment secures their loyalty and prevents US beachhead

### Outcome (1873-1894)

When California secedes, Oregon and Washington **do NOT become US states** - California's lobbying/bribing prevents statehood or causes secession. They become independent entities (territories or independent nations) that California brings into its economic and strategic sphere.

### Later Development (1894-1907)

**See `world-building/pacific-alliance-cascadia-compact.md` for full details.**

- **1894:** Pacific Economic Conference in Portland → Oregon, Washington Territory, and California sign the **Portland Articles** (free trade zone, mutual defense, joint naval stations, annual rotating summit)
- **1907:** Treaty of Astoria → Washington (now a state) formally joins. **Pacific Alliance** officially born
- **Result:** On paper, three equal sovereigns. In practice, California writes 60% of the budget, stations 70% of the ships, and hosts the summit whenever it wants. Oregon and Washington keep their rainy, stubborn, lumber-and-salmon identity, but do it under a navy that flies the Bear Flag.

## 1898: Spanish-American War Analogue

**California's Rational Self-Interest:** California has **zero realistic reason to stick its fingers into the Atlantic (Cuba) in 1898**.

### The Breakdown

| Cuba (Atlantic) | Philippines/Guam (Pacific) | California's rational self-interest |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 5,000 miles away, opposite side of the continent | 2,000–3,000 miles across **its own ocean** | Pacific only |
| Requires shipping an army through hostile or neutral waters (CSA, Native states, or long way around Cape Horn) | Can sail straight from San Francisco with its own fleet | Pacific only |
| Sugar economy competes directly with California's own growers | Coaling stations, cable stations, trade routes to Asia | Pacific only |
| U.S. East Coast still claims primacy there | No one else has a credible Pacific fleet in 1898 | Pacific only |

### Realistic California Behavior in 1898

| Action | Likelihood | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Grab the Philippines (or parts of them) | 95% | Perfectly on California's doorstep, perfect for trade with Asia, zero competition. |
| Grab Guam + maybe Wake/Midway | 90% | Coaling stations, cable stations, perfect for Pacific trade routes. |
| Send troops to Cuba | 0% | Opposite side of continent, no strategic interest, competes with California's own sugar growers. |
| California Mandate established | 95% | California is now the **Pacific power**, not just a Pacific trader. |

**Result:** California becomes a major Pacific power in 1898, but stays out of Atlantic conflicts entirely.

## The "Good Riddance" Dynamic

By 1872–1873, the dynamic is less "California bravely declares independence" and more **"California, please, for the love of God, take your movie stars and leave"** from the rest of the fractured U.S.

### Who Wants California Gone

- **Oregon & Washington:** Tired of San Francisco treating the Columbia River like its private shipping lane and Portland like a suburb.
- **The remaining U.S. (East Coast):** California sends almost no taxes east anymore anyway, but still demands federal navy protection and screams when it doesn't get it.
- **Native super-states:** Prefer one big, predictable neighbour to the south-west over a sprawling, land-hungry U.S. that keeps eyeing the Plains.
- **The CSA:** Happy to see the North lose its richest chunk of its economy and its only real Pacific ports.

### The Divorce

By the time the referendum happens (5 November 1872), the rest of the continent is basically holding the door open and saying:

**"Here's your hat, here's your coat, don't let the Golden Gate hit you on the way out."**

California thinks it's a triumphant declaration of independence. Everyone else treats it like a long-overdue eviction.

Joint press release, 14 February 1873:

**"The United States and the Republic of California have agreed to a peaceful and mutually beneficial separation, effective 4 July 1873. Both nations look forward to a continued close relationship."**

Translation from the U.S. side, whispered in every bar from Seattle to Boston:

**"Good riddance, you insufferable rich bastards. Don't call us, we'll call you."**

No shots fired. No hard feelings (officially). Just the quietest, pettiest, most lucrative break-up in history.

## The North America Equivalent of Australia

California ends up as the **North America equivalent of Australia**:
- Started as a loyal colony
- Grew too rich and too far away
- Quietly became its own thing while still waving the old flag when convenient

## Characteristics

- **No land bridge. Sea and air only.**
- **Rich, smug, and increasingly its own country.**
- **The U.S.'s golden exclave that slowly turns into a Pacific superpower in all but name.**

## Notes

This is not a dramatic secession. It's a gradual drift born of geographic necessity. California doesn't rebel—it just drifts away, becoming too rich, too isolated, and too independent to be effectively controlled from Washington.

By 1873, it's the Republic of California, fully independent and recognized.

By the time of The Ashes (1939), California has been its own country for 66 years. By the time WW1 starts (1914), it has been independent for 41 years—the rich, smug, Pacific-facing youngest sibling who moved out early, didn't get involved in the family politics, and made it rich.
