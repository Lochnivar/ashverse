# Project Review: Consistency and Reorganization Opportunities

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Review project for consistency issues and reorganization opportunities after recent major updates

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - Project is well-organized with minor consistency issues to address

**Key Findings:**
1. One outdated Switzerland reference needs updating
2. California diplomacy documents are well-structured but could use better cross-referencing
3. Canon refresher is up-to-date and comprehensive
4. No major reorganization needed, but some cross-reference improvements recommended

---

## CONSISTENCY ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Outdated Switzerland Reference

**File:** `world-building/pacific-war-implications.md`  
**Line:** 42  
**Issue:** Says "California is the **Switzerland of the Pacific**"  
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS UPDATE**

**Recommendation:** Update to reflect that California is NOT called "Switzerland" in-world. Could either:
- Remove the comparison entirely
- Add note that this is a writer's mental model (like Pacific Venice)
- Update to "neutral Pacific power" without the Switzerland comparison

**Action Required:** Update line 42 to remove or clarify Switzerland reference

---

### 2. California Diplomacy Document Cross-References

**Files:**
- `california-diplomacy.md` (main comprehensive document)
- `california-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md` (Japan-specific cost-benefit)
- `california-council-arbiter.md` (Council of Four Roads specific)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - Documents complement each other well

**Recommendation:** Add explicit cross-references at the top of each document to help writers navigate:
- `california-diplomacy.md` should reference the other two as "related documents"
- `california-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md` already has a "Relationship to Other Documents" section (good!)
- `california-council-arbiter.md` could benefit from a similar section

**Action Required:** Add cross-reference sections to improve navigation

---

## ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. California Document Structure

**Current Structure:** ✅ **GOOD**
- Main diplomacy document (`california-diplomacy.md`) is comprehensive
- Specialized documents (`california-council-arbiter.md`, `california-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md`) handle specific aspects
- No redundancy issues

**Recommendation:** Keep current structure, just improve cross-referencing

---

### 2. Deseret Document Structure

**Current Structure:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- `mormon-deseret.md` - General overview
- `mormon-deseret-banking-neutrality.md` - Banking-specific (Mormon Venice)
- Clear separation of concerns

**Status:** No changes needed

---

### 3. Canon Refresher Status

**File:** `canon-refresher-for-ai.md`

**Status:** ✅ **UP-TO-DATE**
- Includes all six Claude Review Fixes
- Has "Mormon Venice" properly marked as in-world
- Has "Pacific Venice" properly marked as writer's tool only
- California diplomacy section is comprehensive

**Recommendation:** No changes needed

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Documents That Could Benefit from Better Cross-References

1. **`california-diplomacy.md`**
   - Should reference: `california-council-arbiter.md`, `california-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md`
   - Add: "Related Documents" section at top

2. **`california-council-arbiter.md`**
   - Should reference: `california-diplomacy.md` (main document)
   - Add: "Related Documents" section

3. **`mormon-deseret-banking-neutrality.md`**
   - Should reference: `mormon-deseret.md` (general overview)
   - Already has good structure, but could add explicit reference
