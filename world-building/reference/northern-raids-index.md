## Quick Statistics

## SUCCESS RATE ANALYSIS

**Key Point:** Raiders don't need 100% success to be a credible threat. The constant risk of raids, even with failures, creates economic pressure that planters must take seriously.

### Success Rates by Phase

**Phase 1 (1865-1867) - Organized Period:**
- **Success Rate:** 75-85% (better coordination, intelligence, planning)
- **Total Raids:** ~50
- **Successful:** ~38-43 raids
- **Failed:** ~7-12 raids
- **Rationale:** Organized cells with Committee of Nine coordination, better intelligence networks, veteran leadership

**Phase 2 (1867-1894) - Decentralized Period:**
- **High Suppression (1867-1875):** 60-70% success rate
  - 40-60 raids → ~24-42 successful, ~12-18 failures
  - Rationale: Joint USA-CSA patrols are effective, but decentralized cells still operate
- **Viral Spread (1875-1885):** 65-75% success rate
  - 150-200 raids → ~98-150 successful, ~38-50 failures
  - Rationale: More raids, more experience, but also more suppression attempts
- **Routine Suppression (1885-1894):** 70-80% success rate
  - 110-140 raids → ~77-112 successful, ~22-28 failures
  - Rationale: Established patterns, less active suppression, raiders more experienced

**Overall Success Rate (1865-1894):**
- **Estimated:** 68-75% success rate
- **350-450 total raids** → **~238-338 successful, ~70-112 failures**
- **Key Point:** Even with 25-32% failure rate, the constant threat creates economic pressure

### Impact of Failures

**Failed raids still have impact:**
- **Economic disruption:** Even failed raids cause planters to invest in security, reduce production, relocate
- **Psychological pressure:** Constant threat forces planters to take raids seriously, even if many fail
- **Intelligence gathering:** Failed raids provide information for future successful operations
- **Deterrent effect:** Planters can't assume raids will fail - they must prepare for success

**The Credible Threat:**
- Planters can't ignore raids just because some fail
- Even 70% success rate means 3 out of 4 raids succeed
- The economic cost of preparing for raids (security, relocation, crop diversification) is significant even if raids fail
- **Result:** Raiders are a credible threat that planters must take seriously, regardless of failure rate

## DOCUMENTED FAILURES

### Major Failures (Tier 1 - Named)

#### The Battle of Red River Ford (April 12, 1868)
**Date:** April 12, 1868  
**Location:** Red River, Texas-Arkansas border  
**Leader:** Unknown (organized cell, likely Committee of Nine remnants)  
**Force:** 400 raiders (largest single raid of Phase 2 early period)

**The Raid:**
A major organized raid attempting to strike multiple plantations along the Red River. The operation was intercepted by 600 joint USA-CSA border patrols, who had received intelligence about the planned strike. The raiders were cornered at a river crossing, unable to escape.

**The Outcome:**
**Complete failure:** 341 raiders killed in the engagement, 59 captured and hanged the next morning. No slaves freed, no economic damage inflicted. This was the most devastating defeat of the entire 29-year campaign.

**The Significance:**
This raid demonstrated the effectiveness of joint USA-CSA border patrols. It proved that organized cells could be intercepted and destroyed. The massive casualties (400 raiders lost) showed the risks of large-scale operations. This defeat contributed to the end of organized Phase 1 operations and the transition to smaller, decentralized Phase 2 raids.

**Impact:**
- Proved joint patrols could be effective
- Forced raiders to adopt smaller, more decentralized operations
- Showed that large-scale coordination was vulnerable to intelligence leaks
- Demonstrated the risks of major operations

### Notable Failures (Tier 2 - Brief Entries)

#### October 1867: The Ambush at Cumberland Gap
**Location:** Tennessee-Kentucky border  
**Brief Description:** Raid intercepted by joint patrols before reaching targets. 45 raiders killed, 12 captured. No slaves freed, $0 damage.  
**Why Notable:** First major failure after Border Pacification Act, demonstrates joint patrol effectiveness.

#### March 1869: The Mississippi Intelligence Failure
**Location:** Mississippi (Hinds County)  
**Brief Description:** Raid based on outdated intelligence - target plantation had already freed slaves. 28 raiders killed in ambush, 8 captured. No slaves freed, minimal damage.  
**Why Notable:** Shows intelligence failures can lead to complete operational failure.

#### July 1871: The Arkansas River Ambush
**Location:** Arkansas River Valley  
**Brief Description:** River-based raid intercepted by CSA river patrols. 35 raiders killed, 15 captured. 12 slaves freed but recaptured. $8,000 damage.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates that even successful tactical approaches can fail if intercepted.

#### November 1874: The Georgia Trap
**Location:** Central Georgia  
**Brief Description:** Raid walked into prepared ambush - planter had received warning. 42 raiders killed, 18 captured. No slaves freed, $0 damage.  
**Why Notable:** Shows planters could sometimes receive advance warning and prepare defenses.

#### February 1878: The Tennessee Winter Failure
**Location:** Middle Tennessee  
**Brief Description:** Winter raid failed due to weather and poor intelligence. 19 raiders killed, 6 captured. 8 slaves freed but recaptured. $3,000 damage.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates environmental factors and intelligence failures can combine to cause failure.

#### June 1881: The Deep South Penetration Failure
**Location:** South Carolina (Charleston area)  
**Brief Description:** Deep penetration raid intercepted by CSA forces. 38 raiders killed, 14 captured. No slaves freed, $0 damage.  
**Why Notable:** Shows that deep penetration operations were high-risk, high-reward.

#### September 1883: The Coordinated Failure
**Location:** Multi-state (Alabama, Mississippi)  
**Brief Description:** Rare Phase 2 coordination attempt failed - intelligence leaked, both cells intercepted. 67 raiders killed, 23 captured. 45 slaves freed but recaptured. $12,000 damage.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates that even coordination attempts could fail, and intelligence leaks were a constant risk.

#### January 1887: The Manumission Verification Failure
**Location:** Louisiana  
**Brief Description:** Raid targeted plantation that had already freed slaves (intelligence failure). 24 raiders killed, 9 captured. No slaves freed, $5,000 damage to already-freed workers' property.  
**Why Notable:** Shows intelligence failures could lead to targeting wrong plantations, including those that had already manumitted.

#### May 1890: The Final Major Failure
**Location:** Mississippi (Yazoo County)  
**Brief Description:** Last major failure before decline. 31 raiders killed, 11 captured. 22 slaves freed but recaptured. $7,000 damage.  
**Why Notable:** Demonstrates that failures continued even in late period, but became less common as raiders gained experience.

**Grand Total (1865-1894):**
- Total Raids: 350-450
- Successful: ~243-343 (68-75% success rate)
- Failed: ~77-112 (22-32% failure rate)
- Total Slaves Freed: ~200,000 (from successful raids only)

## GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

**Border States (Early Period - 1865-1875):**
- Kentucky-Tennessee: ~40% of raids
- Missouri-Arkansas: ~25% of raids
- Virginia-Maryland: ~15% of raids

**Deep South (Later Period - 1875-1894):**
- Alabama-Mississippi: ~20% early, increases to ~40% late
- Georgia-South Carolina: ~5% early, increases to ~15% late
- Louisiana-Texas: ~5% early, increases to ~10% late

**Geographic Spread Pattern:**
- Early: Concentrated in border states (proximity to Sequoyah)
- Middle: Spreads to Deep South (following relocated planters)
- Late: Widespread across entire Confederacy (no "safe" areas)

## CHARACTER INTEGRATION

**Haskell Family Connections:**
- **Major Frank A. Haskell (Gen 0) - Raider Leader (1865-1867):**
  - Resigns commission after final scene of "The Match" - Court of Grievances at Appomattox where Thomas Fairfax delivers one insult too far (March 1865)
  - This confrontation is the breaking point - Haskell resigns immediately after the scene
  - Leads "The Tennessee Valley Ride" (August 1865) - largest single-raid liberation, establishes his leadership
  - Coordinates "The Christmas Raid" (December 1865) - largest coordinated multi-raid operation
  - Coordinates "The Spring Offensive" (March-April 1866) - largest coordinated campaign
  - Coordinates "The Independence Day Raid" (July 1866) - largest single-day operation
  - Coordinates "The Last Summer" (August 1866) - final major coordinated effort, his last campaign
  - **Retires July 1867:** When Border Pacification Act creates joint USA-CSA patrols, Haskell faces Union blue on the other side of the carbine. His retirement: "I won't fight against my nation." Before joint patrols, it was "continuing the war against the south via private means" - acceptable. Once Union blue is on the other side, it takes the heart out of veteran Union volunteers. Retires to Manchester, New Hampshire, having imprinted professionalism on the movement for almost two years.

**Fairfax Family Connections:**
- "The Georgia Uprising" (November 1865) - Thomas Reginald Fairfax witnesses aftermath
- "The Mississippi Delta Uprising" (June 1879) - John Walter Fairfax witnesses impact
- "The Georgia Tobacco Raid" (October 1882) - Thomas Reginald Fairfax witnesses impact
- Additional connections TBD based on narrative needs
