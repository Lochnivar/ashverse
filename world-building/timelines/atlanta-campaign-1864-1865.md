## KEY POINTS

**Result:** Atlanta besieged but never falls. Ambiguous outcome - neither side wins decisively. Explains Sherman's post-war reputation (tactical success, strategic failure).

**Hood's Replacement:** CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success with Pickett Raid and Hancock wounded creates momentum, need aggressive action in West. NOT desperation - CSA star is ascendant.

**Siege Duration:** 4 months (August-November 1864). Sherman reaches suburbs but cannot break through Hood's defenses.

**Connection to Sherman's March:** Sherman withdraws January 1865 → Receives Grant's telegram January 25 → Begins march to Appomattox January 29.
