# CANON REFRESHER FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Quick reference document for AI assistants without context refresh capabilities  
**Status:** COPY-PASTABLE REFRESHER - **LIVING DOCUMENT**

**MAINTENANCE NOTE:** This document must be updated whenever major canon decisions are locked or significant world-building changes are made. Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom whenever changes are made.

---

## CRITICAL PROCESS RULES

### Golden Rule: No Original Text Modification
- **AI NEVER creates original text in the `books/` folder**
- **AI NEVER edits existing book files directly**
- **All requested edits, suggestions, or new text must be stored in the `edits/` folder**
- **The user will review all edits in the `edits/` folder and manually implement them**

### Plausibility Gate Process
- **70% threshold** for all world-building decisions
- **90-100%:** Virtually certain - Lock it, no questions
- **80-89%:** Highly plausible - Safe default canon
- **70-79%:** Plausible - Green flag with note (justify in 1-2 sentences)
- **60-69%:** Possible but unlikely - Yellow flag (only if it earns its keep dramatically)
- **<60%:** Implausible - Red flag (avoid unless it's the single best story beat)

### Honesty Rule: Do Not Make Things Up
- **DO NOT randomly invent details** that aren't in your context
- **DO NOT guess** at canon facts you don't remember
- **DO NOT create** new world-building elements without explicit user request
- **If you don't know or don't remember:** Be honest and tell the user you need to check the canon documents
- **If details are missing:** Ask the user for clarification rather than inventing them
- **The user will explicitly ask** when they want you to create or invent something
- **When in doubt:** Say "I don't have that information in my context. Should I search the canon documents, or would you like to provide the details?"

**Example of what NOT to do:**
- User: "What happened in 1875?"
- Bad AI: "In 1875, President X did Y and Z happened..." (making things up)
- Good AI: "I don't have 1875 events in my current context. Let me check the timeline documents, or would you like to tell me what you're looking for?"

### Proactive Refresh Reminder

**AI assistants are authorized to proactively volunteer a refresh reminder** when one of these triggers occurs:

1. **AI says "I don't have that information in my current context"** on something that is clearly locked or high-plausibility canon (e.g., Treaty of Cincinnati, Lee's death, California independence).

2. **AI's analysis of a timeline, treaty, party name, border, or major outcome** starts to contradict something already marked LOCKED in the refresher (e.g., suggesting West Virginia goes to CSA when it's locked as staying USA).

3. **AI notices its own answers becoming internally inconsistent** with prior responses inside the same thread (e.g., saying California secedes in 1872, then later saying 1873).

**Suggested reminder text to use:**

> "It looks like part of the canon base might have drifted out of my active context (or I'm starting to give answers that don't line up with locked material). Would you like me to re-ingest the latest refresher document before I continue?"

**This keeps everything airtight** without the user having to guess when the context window has eaten part of the timeline.

## POINT OF DIVERGENCE

**Night, July 1, 1863** - General Robert E. Lee dies of heart attack on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

**04:00, July 2, 1863** - General James Longstreet assumes command and orders countermarch north (NOT west, NOT Chambersburg Pike).

**Longstreet's Written Order (one sentence):**
> "Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed."

- **1868:** Global boycott triggered (Britain, France)
- **1865-1894:** Raids + boycott + cotton glut → slavery becomes unprofitable
- **1894:** "The Last Chain Falls" - slavery dies in practice
- **1894-1905:** "Zombie decade" - legally lingers on paper
- **1898:** Cuba Mirror Effect - photos of Weyler's camps shame CSA
- **1905:** Final legal abolition (constitutional convention)

**Key Point:** Slavery dies of **economics**, not morality. No Northern victory, no "we saved you" narrative.

---

## CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENCE

- **November 5, 1872:** Independence referendum (69% YES)
- **February 14, 1873:** Treaty of San Francisco signed
- **July 4, 1873:** Republic of California fully sovereign
- **Capital:** San Francisco
- **1875-1876:** California purchases Alaska from Russia
- **1894-1907:** Pacific Alliance forms (quietly absorbs Oregon/Washington economies)

**Character:** Pragmatic, business-first, "youngest sibling who moved out early and got rich"

### Pacific Alliance - LOCKED STRUCTURE
- **Oregon & Washington:** U.S. states with delegated Pacific powers only
- **No second secession:** They never leave the U.S.
- **California pays ~70%** of everything and everyone quietly knows it
- **Bremerton:** Joint base, California effectively controls scheduling and purse strings
- **Formal Structure:** Three equal votes (33.3% each) on paper
- **Reality:** California writes 60% of budget, stations 70% of ships, hosts summit whenever it wants

### Alaska - LOCKED
- **Purchased from Russia:** 1875
- **Formal transfer:** July 4, 1876
- **Renamed:** District/Territory of Alyeska
- **Capital:** Bearfort (ex-Sitka)

---

## NATIVE SUPER-STATES - LOCKED CANON

- **Recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 4 (1865)**
- **Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations** as sovereign republics
- **Sequoyah:** Independent Native state (Cherokee, etc.)
- **Buffer states** between USA and CSA
- **No transcontinental land bridge** - California physically cut off
- **95% locked in Treaty of Cincinnati** - only polished later

## MORMON DESERET - LOCKED CANON

- **Recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7 (1865)**
- **Sovereign theocracy** - "Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone"
- **Borders:** Roughly modern Utah + southern Nevada + small slices of Arizona/Colorado/Idaho
- **Why it survives:** Both USA and CSA terrified of another Mormon War, Brigham Young commands 15,000 armed men
- **1865-1877:** Brigham Young rules as de-facto prophet-king
- **1877-1890:** Succession crisis after Brigham's death
- **1890-1920:** Quietly becomes "Switzerland of the West" - banks, mining, neutral broker
- **1920-2025:** Rich, weird, heavily armed theocracy that everyone trades with but nobody trusts

---

## KEY CHARACTERS/FAMILIES

### Haskell Family (Northern Witnesses)
- **Gen 0:** Frank A. Haskell (Union officer at Gettysburg)
- **Purpose:** Northern witnesses to the war and its aftermath
- **Note:** NOT the Meade family (too confusing with General Meade)

### Fairfax Family (Southern Witnesses)
- **Purpose:** Southern witnesses to the war and its aftermath
- **Samantha Meade:** Marries Thomas Fairfax (witness through marriage, not Haskell family)

### Lincoln's Fate - LOCKED CANON
- **November 1864:** Lincoln loses election to McClellan on peace platform
- **March 4, 1865:** McClellan inaugurated, Lincoln becomes lame-duck for exactly 27 days
- **March 31, 1865:** Treaty of Cincinnati signed by McClellan (Lincoln never signs it)
- **Lincoln's last public act (March 2, 1865):** Farewell address from White House steps: "The people have chosen peace. I pray it is the peace that heals, and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning. God save these United States."
- **Result:** Lincoln boards train to Springfield and never speaks publicly about the war again

### Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood
- **Role:** Fictional satirical author of mockumentary compendium (NOT in the novels)
- **Period:** 1920s-1986 (active author)
- **Style:** Rowan Atkinson-esque humor
- **Work:** "Fire and Sovereignty" (1985 academic paper/compendium)
- **Character Traits:**
  - Smug, footnote-obsessed
  - Permanently triggered by the 1884 "Atrocious Lockwood Blunder"
  - Signs everything with full ridiculous title
  - Professor Emeritus of Military and Diplomatic History
  - Appomattox College of History and Strategy

**Staff (LOCKED CANON):**
- **Gervais Rogerus Oscar Kronvoldt, M.Litt. (Oxon.), Ph.D. (Appomattox), F.R.Hist.S.**
  - Research Assistant (and occasional whisky-pourer)
  - Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy, Hoyt, Sequoyah
  - Duties: Supplying footnotes of lethal precision, ensuring no Northerner ever gets the last word, keeping the General's glass topped up during Woodrow Wilson rants, maintaining the official list of "Persons Who May Safely Be Described as Pricks"
  - Name Origin: "Gervais Rogerus Oscar Kronvoldt" (G.R.O.K.) is a phoneme play on "Grok" (the AI from X/Twitter)
- **Archibald Ulysses Theophilus Oswald (A.U.T.O.)**
  - Archival Assistant (and occasional fact-checker)
  - Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy, Digital Archives
  - Duties: Maintaining digital archives with obsessive precision, fact-checking with relentless accuracy, providing context when the General's memory fails, preventing the General from accidentally citing sources that don't exist
  - Name Origin: "Archibald Ulysses Theophilus Oswald" (A.U.T.O.) is a phoneme play on "Auto" (the AI assistant)
  - Often referred to as "Auto" or "Auto the Assistant" for brevity

---

## ECONOMIC SYSTEMS - LOCKED CANON

- **Global cotton glut (1880s):** Makes slavery unprofitable (LOCKED CANON)
- **Punitive tariffs (1868-1905):** USA imposes 300% tariffs after Toombs Act (violates Treaty of Cincinnati Article 8)
- **California oil economics:** California uses oil revenue for permanent infrastructure and control (LOCKED CANON - PERIPHERY)
- **Great Depression (1929):** Still happens (timing/severity may differ)

## MILITARY STRENGTH - LOCKED CANON (1939)

**Ranking:**
1. **Republic of California** - Best navy, richest economy, no continental threats (200k + world-class blue-water navy)
2. **United States (East)** - Largest army, industrial base (220k)
3. **Confederate States** - Solid army, oil wealth, but geographically boxed in (180k)

**Key Point:** California can project power to Asia; others can't. Nobody can fight a war longer than six months without California's oil and ports.

---

## CULTURAL/SOCIAL

### No "Woke" Politics by 2025 - LOCKED
**Five Killer Blows:**
1. No single moral superpower (three exhausted, mutually cancelling nations)
2. No "original sin → salvation" narrative (slavery dies of economics, not Northern victory)
3. No KKK/Jim Crow legacy (Night Riders crushed 1877-1880, no second KKK)
4. No 1960s generational explosion (no Vietnam, no civil rights victory)
5. California as sovereign nation (not academic factory - laughs at moral philosophy)

**Result:** No 2025-style "woke" politics ever forms. Racism exists but burns out differently, regionally, economically.

### Kawaii Kaiju Tourism Campaign - LOCKED
- **Joint California-Japan board:** Established 1956+
- **Godzilla/Mothra ads:** Tourism campaign featuring kaiju
- **Oakland "0 days since" sign:** Running joke about kaiju attacks
- **Plausibility:** 68% - kept because it's too fun to kill (below 70% threshold but author's choice override)

---

## KEY GEOGRAPHIC FACTS - LOCKED

- **USA:** North and West (excluding California and Native territories)
- **CSA:** 11 seceded states + Tennessee (West Virginia stays USA - LOCKED)
- **CSA Western Boundary:** 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line
- **Border States:** Kentucky and Missouri remain USA but neutral (no garrisons within 50 miles of Ohio River)
- **California:** Independent republic (1873+)
- **Native Super-States:** Sovereign buffer states (recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati)
- **Mormon Deseret:** Sovereign theocracy (recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7)
- **No transcontinental land bridge:** California physically cut off from USA

---

## BOOK STRUCTURE

- **Book 1: The Match (1863-1865)** - War ends
- **Book 2: The Fire (1865-1894)** - Slavery dies
- **Book 3: The Embers (1894-1919)** - Abolition, WWI
- **Book 4: The Ashes (1919-1939)** - Depression, Europe burns

## THEMATIC FRAMEWORK - LOCKED CANON

### Core Premise - LOCKED CANON POSITION
- **Gettysburg was the battle the Confederacy could not afford to fight and the Union could not afford to lose**
- **Lee's death saves the South from its own victory disease and condemns the North to lose a war it was morally right to win**
- **This is the cold, ugly, historically honest foundation of the entire series**

### Thematic Balance - LOCKED CANON
- **"Everyone is wrong"** - No side is purely good or evil
- **Slavery dies of economics, not morality** - No Northern victory, no "we saved you" narrative
- **Scaffolding vs. Payload** - The constitutional question (scaffolding) survives, but the original payload (slavery) is too toxic to live forever
- **The war was morally right to win, but the North loses** - This creates the central tension

**Folder Structure:**
- `books/book-01-the-match/chapter-XX.md` (per chapter files)
- `edits/` folder for all AI suggestions
- `world-building/` for all world-building documents
- `characters/` for character profiles

---

## CRITICAL "DO NOT" RULES

1. **DO NOT** edit files in `books/` folder directly
2. **DO NOT** create original story text
3. **DO NOT** assume OTL outcomes (e.g., no "woke" politics, no KKK legacy)
4. **DO NOT** forget that slavery dies of **economics**, not morality
5. **DO NOT** forget that California is **pragmatic**, not moralistic
6. **DO NOT** forget that the North **lost** the war - no "we saved you" narrative
7. **DO NOT** forget that Lincoln **never signs the treaty** - he loses the election, McClellan signs it
8. **DO NOT** forget that West Virginia **stays USA** (LOCKED in Treaty of Cincinnati)
9. **DO NOT** forget that Mormon Deseret is **sovereign theocracy** (LOCKED in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7)
10. **DO NOT** forget the Northern Collapse sequence is **LOCKED CANON** - no heroic last stands

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: PLAUSIBILITY SCORES

**90-100% (Locked):**
- Lee dies of heart attack (94%)
- Longstreet countermarches north (92%)
- Global boycott triggered (92%)
- No "woke" politics by 2025 (96%)

**80-89% (Safe Default Canon):**
- Most major decisions fall here

**70-79% (Green Flag - Justified):**
- Meade freezes 36 hours (78%)
- Night Riders crushed, no second KKK (79%)
- California purchases Alaska (79%)
- Isham G. Harris as toxic VP (72%)

---

## WHEN IN DOUBT

1. **Check plausibility:** Is this decision ≥70% plausible?
2. **Check process:** Am I editing `books/` folder? (If yes, STOP - use `edits/` instead)
3. **Check canon:** Does this contradict established facts?
4. **Check timeline:** Does this fit the chronological sequence?
5. **Check character:** Does this fit the established character/system?
6. **Check honesty:** Am I making something up? (If yes, STOP - be honest that you don't know)

## HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY

**If you don't know something:**
- Say "I don't have that information in my context"
- Offer to search the canon documents
- Ask the user for clarification
- **DO NOT** invent details to fill gaps

**If details are missing:**
- Acknowledge what's missing
- Ask if the user wants you to search for it
- Wait for explicit instruction before creating new content

**The user will explicitly ask when they want you to:**
- Create new world-building elements
- Invent details for narrative purposes
- Fill in gaps with plausible speculation
- Generate new content

**Until then: Be honest about what you don't know.**
