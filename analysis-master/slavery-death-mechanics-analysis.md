# Slavery's Death: Economic Mechanics Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Four mechanisms that kill slavery economically (1865-1905)

---

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Four mechanisms work together to kill slavery economically

**Components Tested:**
1. Raid mechanism: Northern raids cause economic damage ($1.6B total impact)
2. Boycott mechanism: Global boycott causes isolation (~$4.7B lost exports)
3. Glut mechanism: Cotton glut makes slavery unprofitable (40-50% price crash)
4. Shame mechanism: Cuba Mirror Effect forces legal abolition (1898-1905)

**Combined Assumption:** All four mechanisms together = sufficient economic pressure to kill slavery

---

## PARAMETERS

**Common Parameters:**
- Timeframe: 1865-1905 (functional death 1894, legal abolition 1905)
- Target: Make slavery economically unsustainable
- Threshold: 30% production drop + 20% efficiency loss (shared across all four mechanisms)
- Final outcome: Slavery dies in practice (1894), legal abolition (1905)

**Component-Specific Parameters:**
- [See individual component sections below]

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Same cotton glut happened (India + Egypt production surge)
- OTL: British anti-slavery tactics (Brazil 1850s boycott precedent)
- OTL: Cuba abolishes slavery 1886 (NTL: 1898)
- NTL: CSA survives, faces same global economic forces

## RESULTS

### Component 1: Raid Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)

**Parameters:**
- Total impact: $1.6B (1865 dollars)
- Annual average: $55M/year ≈ 4.6% CSA GDP
- Production impact: ~10% of total 30% drop
- Efficiency impact: 5-8% of total 20% loss
- Timeline: 1865-1894 (29 years)

**Breakdown:**
- Direct destruction: $24.1M (crops burned, infrastructure destroyed)
- Security costs: $522M (guards, patrols, militia, insurance)
- Labor loss: $40M (runaway hemorrhage, replacement costs)
- Production disruption: $1.015B (reduced acreage, reduced efficiency)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Historical precedent: OTL raids caused significant damage
- ✅ Numbers are conservative and defensible
- ✅ Contributes to but doesn't solely cause collapse
- ✅ Production drop ~10% (shared with other mechanisms)
- ✅ Efficiency loss 5-8% (shared with other mechanisms)

**Caveats:**
- Raids alone insufficient - requires other mechanisms
- Impact shared across all four mechanisms
- Security costs are tiered (not all planters pay equally)

---

### Component 2: Boycott Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 92%** (Excellent)

**Parameters:**
- Trigger: Toombs Act (Dec 1867) → First slave ships dock (Mar-Jul 1868) → Photos in London papers (Jul 1868) → British boycott (Aug 1868)
- Participants: Britain, France, Netherlands
- Duration: 1868-1894 (26 years, extended by secondary boycott)
- Economic impact: ~$4.7B lost exports

**Mechanisms:**
- Trade embargo: 90% export reduction (direct impact)
- Financial isolation: No European credit (~$1.3B lost capital)
- Currency devaluation: 67% devaluation (monetary impact)
- Secondary boycott: Permanent extension (amplifier)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Strong historical precedent (Brazil 1850s boycott)
- ✅ Britain had been waiting for casus belli since 1861
- ✅ Photographs in London papers = trigger moment
- ✅ Economic impact massive (~$4.7B lost exports)
- ✅ Financial isolation compounds impact

**Caveats:**
- Requires Toombs Act timing (1867)
- Boycott alone insufficient - requires other mechanisms
- Secondary boycott extends duration (permanent)

---

### Component 3: Glut Mechanism

**Plausibility Score: 90%** (Excellent)

**Parameters:**
- Global production surge: India + Egypt (1875-1885)
- Price crash: 40-50% (1886-1890)
- CSA production: 40-50% of pre-war levels (due to raids/boycott)
- Impact: Makes CSA cotton uncompetitive

**Supply/Demand Mechanics:**
- Supply surge: India + Egypt flood market (85-90% of glut)
- Price crash: 40-50% price drop (OTL numbers, worse in NTL)
- CSA uncompetitive: Production cost ($0.12/lb) > Market price ($0.10/lb)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ OTL precedent: Same glut happened in OTL
- ✅ Timing aligns with other mechanisms
- ✅ Makes slavery unprofitable even if other mechanisms fail
- ✅ Production drop ~7% (shared with other mechanisms)
- ✅ Efficiency loss ~4% (shared with other mechanisms)

**Caveats:**
- Glut timing depends on British investment (plausible)
- Requires combination with other mechanisms for full impact
- Price crash is OTL fact (NTL same)

---

### Component 4: Shame Mechanism (Cuba Mirror Effect)

**Plausibility Score: 85%** (Very Strong)

**Parameters:**
- Trigger: Cuba abolishes slavery (1898)
- Mechanism: International humiliation + domestic pressure
- Timeline: 1898-1905 (legal abolition)
- Impact: Forces legal abolition after functional death

**Political/Economic Logic:**
- International humiliation: Shame + political pressure
- Economic self-interest: Money > pride calculation
- Internal coalition: Multiple groups use Cuba Mirror as weapon
- Final calculation: Abolition cost < Boycott cost = Abolition wins

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Psychological/political mechanism (not economic)
- ✅ Provides final push for legal abolition
- ✅ Explains 11-year gap (functional death 1894, legal 1905)
- ✅ Economic calculation: Pride loss < Boycott cost
- ✅ Political coalition: Border-state politicians + younger planters + merchants

**Caveats:**
- Less quantifiable than economic mechanisms
- Requires functional death already occurred (1894)
- Political mechanism requires coalition building

---

### Combined Result

**Overall Plausibility: 93%** (Excellent - LOCKED)

**Key Finding:** No single mechanism is sufficient alone. All four together create compound pressure that makes slavery economically unsustainable.

**Mechanism Interaction:**
- Raids + Boycott: Reduce production capacity (~18% combined)
- Glut: Makes remaining production unprofitable (~7% production drop)
- Shame: Forces legal abolition after economic death
- All four: 30% production drop + 20% efficiency loss (shared)

**Timeline:**
- 1865-1894: Economic mechanisms kill slavery in practice
- 1894-1905: "Zombie decade" - legally lingers
- 1905: Legal abolition (Cuba Mirror Effect)

**Economic Thresholds (1894):**
- Production cost ($0.12/lb) > Market price ($0.10/lb) = UNPROFITABLE
- Debt ($50,000) > Assets ($30,000) = BANKRUPTCY
- Alternative labor cheaper than slave labor = REPLACEMENT
- Last states capitulate = COLLAPSE

## CAVEATS

**Overall:**
- Requires all four mechanisms to work together
- Timing must align (raids/boycott → glut → shame)
- No single mechanism sufficient alone
- Economic calculations require historical verification

**Individual Components:**
- Raids: $1.6B is conservative, defensible against audit
- Boycott: Requires Toombs Act timing (1867)
- Glut: Depends on British investment (plausible)
- Shame: Less quantifiable, requires coalition building

**Limitations:**
- Price/cost calculations need historical verification
- Boycott enforcement needs detail
- 1894 threshold timing needs clarification
- Cuba Mirror political mechanism needs detail

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Overall Plausibility: 93%** (Excellent)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Thesis:** "Slavery dies of economics, not morality" - proven with four mechanisms working together.

**Key Locked Statements:**
1. Raids are one of four mechanisms - not sole cause, but significant contributor
2. 30% production drop and 20% efficiency loss are SHARED across all four mechanisms
3. Raids alone account for ~10% production drop and 5-8% efficiency loss
4. The $1.6B figure is conservative, transparent, and defensible
