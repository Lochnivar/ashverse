# COMPENDIUM REORGANIZATION NOTES

**Date:** December 9, 2025  
**Status:** REORGANIZED - Part 0 eliminated, structure streamlined

## WHAT CHANGED

### Eliminated: Part 0 (Foundations)
**Problem:** 10 chapters of abstract overview before reader has context
- Too front-loaded
- Information overload without emotional connection
- Made "develop as you go" harder
- Dense, intimidating start

**Solution:** Start with dramatic hook, weave topics into narrative after context established

## WHY THIS WORKS BETTER

### 1. Reader Experience
- **Old:** Starts with 10 chapters of abstract concepts
- **New:** Starts with dramatic hook (Lee's death)
- **Result:** Emotional investment before abstract analysis

### 2. Information Retention
- **Old:** "Slavery dies of economics" (abstract, easy to forget)
- **New:** Experience each mechanism in detail, then understand thesis
- **Result:** Reader GETS it because they experienced it

### 3. "Develop as You Go" Compatibility
- **Old:** Requires writing comprehensive overviews FIRST
- **New:** Write compendium chapters as you write novels
- **Result:** Each compendium chapter FOLLOWS (or parallels) novel chapters

### 4. Fairfax-Lockwood's Voice
- **Old:** Abstract, distant, encyclopedic
- **New:** Concrete, immediate, opinionated
- **Result:** Much funnier, more engaging

**Example:**
- **Abstract:** "The Northern raids represented one of four economic mechanisms."
- **Concrete:** "Captain Elias Kane's decision to burn the Pettigrew mansion and shoot Colonel Pettigrew in front of his family was, the present writer is obliged to note, not strictly within the guidelines established by the Committee of Nine."
