**Reviewer:** Auto (Archival Assistant)  
**Purpose:** Identify references to OTL events that explicitly never happen in NTL  
**Status:** Review Complete

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Found **3 problematic references** to OTL events that never happen in NTL. All are in `world-building/political/presidents-and-parties.md` and incorrectly reference OTL Reconstruction Era.

---

## PROBLEMATIC REFERENCES

### 1. "Reconstruction of remaining US territory" (Line 431)

**File:** `world-building/political/presidents-and-parties.md`  
**Context:** USA presidential timeline, 1869-1873 section  
**Issue:** References "Reconstruction" as if it's an NTL event

**Current Text:**
```
- Relations with CSA (punitive tariffs after Toombs Act)
- Reconstruction of remaining US territory
- Immigration and western expansion
```

**Problem:** OTL Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) never happens in NTL. This should be "post-war rebuilding" or "territorial reorganization" - not "Reconstruction."

**Recommendation:** Change to "Post-war territorial reorganization" or "Rebuilding of remaining US territory"

---

### 2. "End of Reconstruction era" (Line 464)

**File:** `world-building/political/presidents-and-parties.md`  
**Context:** USA presidential timeline, 1877-1881 section  
**Issue:** References "Reconstruction era" ending in 1876

**Current Text:**
```
**Key Issues:**
- **The Slogan** - "Three hundred thousand Northern boys died for a Republican lie" (printed in two-inch type on red-white-and-blue banners)
- End of Reconstruction era
- Economic recovery
```

**Problem:** There is no "Reconstruction era" in NTL to end. This is an OTL-only concept.

**Recommendation:** Remove this line entirely, or change to "Post-war rebuilding complete" or similar

---

### 3. "End of Reconstruction, Republican Party dissolves" (Line 743)

**File:** `world-building/political/presidents-and-parties.md`  
**Context:** Timeline summary section  
**Issue:** Links "End of Reconstruction" with Republican Party dissolution

**Current Text:**
```
- **1876:** End of Reconstruction, Republican Party dissolves
```

**Problem:** Again, no Reconstruction era exists in NTL to end.

**Recommendation:** Change to "1876: Republican Party dissolves" (remove Reconstruction reference)

---

## ACCEPTABLE REFERENCES (No Changes Needed)

### Lowercase "reconstruction" (Post-War Rebuilding)

These references are **acceptable** because they refer to post-war rebuilding/reconstruction of power structures, not OTL Reconstruction Era:

1. **`world-building/california/ca-alaska-purchase-1875-1876.md` (Line 73):**
   - "U.S. is exhausted - Just finished Civil War, broke, focused on reconstruction"
   - ✅ **OK** - Refers to post-war rebuilding, not OTL Reconstruction

2. **`world-building/political/csa-presidents-gentry-vs-hayseed-1865-1939.md` (Line 51):**
   - "Post-war reconstruction of power"
   - ✅ **OK** - Refers to CSA rebuilding political power, not OTL Reconstruction

3. **`world-building/political/csa-political-parties-gentry-vs-hayseed.md` (Line 100):**
   - "Post-war reconstruction of power"
   - ✅ **OK** - Same as above

4. **`world-building/economic/slavery-and-raids-master.md` (Line 570):**
   - "Without OTL Reconstruction's 'forced equality' backlash:"
   - ✅ **OK** - Explicitly compares to OTL, not asserting NTL Reconstruction

---

## SUMMARY

**Total Issues Found:** 3  
**All in:** `world-building/political/presidents-and-parties.md`

**Action Required:**
1. Line 431: Change "Reconstruction of remaining US territory" → "Post-war territorial reorganization"
2. Line 464: Remove "End of Reconstruction era" or change to "Post-war rebuilding complete"
3. Line 743: Change "End of Reconstruction, Republican Party dissolves" → "Republican Party dissolves"

**Status:** Ready for correction
