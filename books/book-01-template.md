## Book Blurb
Kaelen has spent his entire life in the shadow of the Ashen Wastes, a forbidden zone where the ruins of the ancient empire lie buried. When a strange artifact awakens dormant powers within him, he discovers he is Ashborn—one of the rare few who can channel the residual magic of the fallen civilization. But this gift comes with a price: dark forces have been searching for someone like him, and they will stop at nothing to claim his power.

As Kaelen flees his home, he crosses paths with Lyra, a scholar seeking the truth behind the Great Burning, and Thorne, a warrior with his own connection to the ashes. Together, they must navigate a world where the past is not dead, and the ashes hold secrets that could either save their world or destroy it completely.

## Core Plot
Kaelen, a young man from a border town, discovers he is Ashborn when an ancient artifact reacts to his touch. This awakening draws the attention of the Ashen Hunters, a fanatical order that captures Ashborn for unknown purposes. Forced to flee, Kaelen embarks on a journey that will reveal the truth about his heritage, the nature of Ashborn power, and the dark forces manipulating events from the shadows.
