# Presidential Analogues: Recommendations for Filling In

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** RECOMMENDATIONS  
**Purpose:** Provide recommendations for filling in the Hoover and FDR analogues in the presidential timeline

**BASED ON:**
- Locked "Different Type of Crisis" (1929-1935, timing flexible)
- Current timeline: Hoover analogue (1929-1933), FDR analogue (1933-1939+)
- Analysis showing timeline is compatible with "Different Type of Crisis"

## CURRENT ANALOGUES

### 1. Herbert Hoover Analogue (1929-1933)
- **Current:** Charles Curtis
- **Party:** Constitutional Unity Party (CUP)

- **Plausibility:** 86% (LOCKED)

### 2. FDR Analogue (1933-1939+)
- **Current:** Franklin Delano Wynkoop
- **Party:** National Union Party (NUP)
- **Role:** New Deal/Economic Concord, recovery
- **Plausibility:** 89% (LOCKED)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option 1: Use Real Historical Figures (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale:**
- Real historical figures increase plausibility
- Easier for readers to connect with
- Less "on-the-nose" than obvious analogues
- Still allows narrative flexibility

#### For Hoover Analogue (1929-1933):

**Recommendation: Use Real Herbert Hoover**

**Why:**
- **Real person:** Born 1874, age 55 in 1929 (perfect age)
- **OTL role:** Secretary of Commerce (1921-1928), President (1929-1933)
- **NTL fit:** Makes sense as CUP candidate (business-friendly, competent administrator)
- **Narrative:** Still gets blamed for crisis, but less dramatically (fits "Different Type of Crisis")
- **Plausibility:** 90%+ (instead of 86%)

**Alternative: Charles Curtis (Current)**
- **Real person:** Born 1860, age 69 in 1929 (older, but plausible)
- **OTL role:** VP under Hoover (1929-1933), Senator from Kansas
- **NTL fit:** Could work, but less well-known than Hoover
- **Plausibility:** 86% (current)

**Verdict:** **Use real Herbert Hoover** - higher plausibility, better known, perfect age, fits narrative

#### For FDR Analogue (1933-1939+):

**Recommendation: Use Real Franklin D. Roosevelt**

**Why:**
- **Real person:** Born 1882, age 51 in 1933 (perfect age)
- **OTL role:** Governor of NY (1929-1932), President (1933-1945)
- **NTL fit:** Makes sense as NUP candidate (charismatic, reformist, trade-focused)
- **Narrative:** Still wins 1932, but implements "Economic Concord" instead of unified "New Deal" (fits "Different Type of Crisis")
- **Plausibility:** 92%+ (instead of 89%)

**Alternative: Franklin Delano Wynkoop (Current)**
- **Fictional:** Name too similar to FDR (FDW vs. FDR)
- **NTL fit:** Works, but feels like obvious analogue
- **Plausibility:** 89% (current)

**Verdict:** **Use real Franklin D. Roosevelt** - higher plausibility, better known, perfect age, fits narrative, acceptable in alternate history

---

### Option 2: Keep Current Analogues (Alternative)

**Rationale:**
- Already established in timeline
- Allows more narrative flexibility
- Less obvious connection to OTL

**For Hoover Analogue:**
- **Keep:** Charles Curtis
- **Adjustment:** Emphasize his role as competent administrator who gets blamed
- **Plausibility:** 86% (current)

**For FDR Analogue:**
- **Keep:** Franklin Delano Wynkoop
- **Adjustment:** Consider different name to avoid obvious FDR connection
- **Plausibility:** 89% (current)

**Verdict:** **Less recommended** - real historical figures are stronger

## DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommendation 1: Use Real Herbert Hoover (1929-1933)

**Character Profile:**
- **Name:** Herbert Clark Hoover
- **Born:** August 10, 1874 (age 55 in 1929)
- **Party:** Constitutional Unity Party (CUP)
- **Background:** Mining engineer, humanitarian, Secretary of Commerce (1921-1928)
- **Election:** 1928 (defeats NUP candidate)
- **Narrative:** Competent administrator, business-friendly, gets blamed for "Different Type of Crisis"
- **Crisis Response:** Less dramatic than OTL (crisis is less severe), but still gets blamed
- **1932 Election:** Loses to FDR analogue, but less of a landslide (crisis is less dramatic)
- **Plausibility:** 90%+

**Why This Works:**
- Real person, perfect age, well-known
- Fits CUP platform (business-friendly, competent administrator)
- Narrative works with "Different Type of Crisis" (less dramatic blame, but still blamed)
- Higher plausibility than Charles Curtis

### Recommendation 2: Use Real Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1939+)

**Character Profile:**
- **Name:** Franklin Delano Roosevelt
- **Born:** January 30, 1882 (age 51 in 1933)
- **Party:** National Union Party (NUP)
- **Background:** Governor of NY (1929-1932), Assistant Secretary of Navy (1913-1920)
- **Election:** 1932, 1936 (defeats CUP candidates)
- **Narrative:** Charismatic reformist, implements "Economic Concord" instead of unified "New Deal"
- **Crisis Response:** Three separate responses (USA, CSA, California), not unified program
- **Recovery:** Less dramatic than OTL (crisis is less severe), but still gets credit
- **Plausibility:** 92%+

**Why This Works:**
- Real person, perfect age, well-known
- Fits NUP platform (trade-focused, reformist, pro-cooperation)
- Narrative works with "Different Type of Crisis" (Economic Concord, not unified New Deal)
- Higher plausibility than fictional analogue
- Acceptable in alternate history (real historical figures are common)

## NARRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR "DIFFERENT TYPE OF CRISIS"

### Herbert Hoover (1929-1933):

**OTL Narrative:**
- Gets blamed for Great Depression
- Seen as doing too little, too late
- Loses 1932 election in landslide

**NTL Narrative (Different Type of Crisis):**
- Gets blamed for "Different Type of Crisis" (less dramatically)
- Crisis is less severe (no unified bubble, USA already "flickering")
- Still seen as doing too little, but blame is less intense
- Loses 1932 election, but less of a landslide (crisis is less dramatic)
- Narrative: "Hoover didn't prevent it" rather than "Hoover caused it"

**Key Adjustments:**
- Less dramatic blame narrative
- Crisis starts 1929-1930 (timing flexible)
- Response is less dramatic (crisis is less severe)
- Still loses, but less dramatically

---

### Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1939+):

**OTL Narrative:**
- Wins 1932 election, implements New Deal
- Gets credit for recovery
- Wins 1936 election in landslide

**NTL Narrative (Different Type of Crisis):**
- Wins 1932 election (crisis still happens, voters want change)
- Implements "Economic Concord" (three separate responses, not unified New Deal)
- Gets credit for recovery (less dramatic, but still credited)
- Wins 1936 election (recovery still happens, voters still credit president)
- Narrative: "Economic Concord" cooperation, not unified program

**Key Adjustments:**
- Not unified "New Deal" but "Economic Concord" or separate programs
- Less dramatic recovery (crisis is less severe)
- Still wins 1936, but less of a landslide (recovery is less dramatic)
- Response is three separate programs (USA, CSA, California)
