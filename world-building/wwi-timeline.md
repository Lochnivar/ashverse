# World War I in the NTL

## WWI Still Happens on Schedule (1914)

WWI still happens on roughly the same schedule, and the NTL actually makes the European powder keg **more** likely to blow in 1914.

## Why It Still Happens

| OTL Trigger (1914) | NTL version (1914) | Does it still happen? |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Balkan tinderbox + Serbian nationalism | Still there – Austria-Hungary, Russia, Serbia unchanged. | Yes |
| Franz Ferdinand assassinated 28 June 1914 | Still happens – the Black Hand, the wrong turn, the sandwich, all untouched by 1863 butterflies. | Yes |
| Rigid alliance system | Germany–Austria vs. Russia–France–Britain still locked in. | Yes |
| Schlieffen Plan / mobilisation timetables | Germany still needs to knock out France fast before Russia mobilises. | Yes |
| British guarantee of Belgian neutrality | Still in force. Germany still invades Belgium to outflank France. | Yes |

## The Only NTL Butterflies

| Butterfly | Effect in NTL | Does it stop the war? |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Weaker U.S. (no land bridge, smaller navy) | U.S. has **zero** ability to mediate crises like Morocco or Agadir. | Makes war **more** likely |
| No strong Wilson-style "moral diplomacy" | No American president in 1914 with the clout to threaten or cajole Europe into backing off. | Makes war **more** likely |
| Britain slightly poorer (CSA cotton boycott) | Royal Navy still vastly superior. No real change in British willingness to fight. | No change |

## Realistic 1914–1918 in the NTL

- War starts **on schedule** (July–August 1914)
- Same opening moves: Germany through Belgium, Marne, trenches
- **No U.S. entry in 1917** – the fractured U.S. has no army to send, no money to lend, and no political will
- War lasts **longer (1914–1919 or 1920)** because no American doughboys tip the balance
- Ends in **exhaustion stalemate** → punitive but not Carthaginian peace → Weimar-style resentments still fester → round two in the 1930s–40s

## Result

WWI happens on schedule.

It is **worse** and **longer** because the United States is a non-player.

Ferdinand still gets shot.

The wrong turn still happens.

The avalanche still comes down.

The only thing that changes is the U.S. sits it out and the 20th century in Europe gets even bloodier.
