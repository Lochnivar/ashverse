## PARTY EVOLUTION CONTEXT

| Era | Dominant Party | Why |
|-----|----------------|-----|
| **1865-1890** | Gentry Democrats | Planter class still owns the land and the votes |
| **1890-1910** | Hayseed surge (Populist-Labor Alliance) | Cotton glut + debt crisis → poor whites revolt |
| **1910-1925** | Gentry comeback (with oil money) | New wealth recenters power in cities |
| **1925-1939** | Hayseed resurgence (Huey P. Long) | Depression hits farmers hardest → "Share Our Wealth" |

## ERA BREAKDOWN

### Era 1: Gentry Dominance (1866-1896)

**Context:** Planter class controls land, votes, and money. Post-war reconstruction of power.

| Term | President | Party | Street Nickname | Legacy |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **1866-1871** | Alexander H. Stephens | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "Little Alec" | Dies in office 1871; last moderate voice |
| **1871-1872** | Robert M. T. Hunter (VP ascends) | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | (caretaker) | Finishes term quietly |
| **1872-1878** | Robert Toombs | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Old Lion" | Toombs Act → boycott → leaves hated |
| **1878-1884** | John C. Breckinridge | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Cleanup Man" | Tries to fix Toombs mess; fails |
| **1884-1890** | James L. Kemper | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Railroad Gentleman" | First big industrial push |
| **1890-1896** | Benjamin H. Hill | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Silent" / "The Last Planter" | Oversees slavery's functional death (1894); tongue cancer caught early, amputated after election |

**Key Issues:**
- Rebuilding economy after war
- Trade relationships (Europe, California)
- Maintaining planter class power
- Debt management (gold standard)
- Toombs Act disaster (1872-1878)
- Slavery's functional death (1894)

### Era 2: Hayseed Surge (1896-1914)

**Context:** Cotton glut + debt crisis → poor whites revolt. Economic desperation drives political change.

| Term | President | Party | Street Nickname | Legacy |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **1896-1902** | Thomas E. Watson | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "Tom the Wool-Hat" | First Hayseed president – debt relief, rail regulation |
| **1902-1908** | James K. Vardaman | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The White Chief" | Fiery populist high-water mark |
| **1908-1914** | Hoke Smith | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The Georgia Cyclone" | Peak Hayseed power |

**Key Issues:**
- Debt relief (greenbacks, state warehouses)
- High protective tariffs
- Public works programs
- Rail regulation
- Expanding franchise ("every white man who works the land should vote")
- Final legal abolition (1905) - happens during Hayseed era

---

### Era 3: Gentry Comeback (1914-1926)

**Context:** New wealth (Texas oil, industrial growth) recenters power in cities. Gentry adapts to new economy.

| Term | President | Party | Street Nickname | Legacy |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **1914-1920** | Oscar W. Underwood | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Tariff Man" | Gentry comeback with oil money |
| **1920-1926** | John Sharp Williams | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Silver Fox" | Trade normalisation, Concord cooperation |

**Key Issues:**
- Oil money, industrial growth
- Urban elites gain power
- Pro-trade with California
- Sound money, gold standard
- Trade normalisation (1905-1920)
- American Concord cooperation (1917-1925)

---

### Era 4: Hayseed Resurgence (1926-1939+)

**Context:** Depression hits farmers hardest → "Share Our Wealth" movement. Economic crisis drives Hayseed comeback.

| Term | President | Party | Street Nickname | Legacy |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **1926-1932** | Huey P. Long | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The Kingfish" | "Every man a king" – elected 1925 on wealth-sharing |
| **1932-1938** | Carter Glass | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Austerity Gentleman" | Depression-era conservative comeback |
| **1938-1944** | Theodore G. Bilbo | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Little Man" | Hard-right backlash (still president in 1939) |

**Key Issues:**
- Depression hits farmers hardest
- "Share Our Wealth" movement (Huey P. Long)
- Debt relief, public works
- High protective tariffs
- Anti-USA, anti-California rhetoric
- Trade collapse (CSA crisis trigger - 1929-1935)

## POTENTIAL HISTORICAL FIGURES / ANALOGUES

### Gentry Figures:
- **Alexander H. Stephens:** OTL CSA VP, moderate, could be first post-war president
- **Bourbon Democrats:** OTL post-war Southern Democrats (conservative, planter class)
- **Bankers / Railroad Barons:** Industrial interests, urban elites

### Hayseed Figures:
- **Huey P. Long:** "Share Our Wealth" populist (1925-1939)
- **Populist leaders:** OTL Populist Party figures (1890s)
- **Readjusters:** OTL Virginia movement (debt relief, public works)
- **Factory worker advocates:** Union interests, labor leaders

---

## NARRATIVE PATTERNS

### Gentry Presidencies:
- **Tone:** "Civilisation, hierarchy, and not letting the wrong sort vote"
- **Policies:** Free trade, sound money, minimal government
- **Relations:** Pro-trade with Europe & California
- **Voting:** Literacy tests, poll taxes

### Hayseed Presidencies:
- **Tone:** "Every man a king, but no kings in Richmond"

## TIMING ALIGNMENT WITH USA

### USA Timeline (for reference):
- **1929-1933:** Herbert Hoover (takes Depression blame)
- **1933-1939+:** Franklin D. Roosevelt (Economic Concord, recovery)

### CSA Timeline (Hayseed Resurgence):
- **1925-1931:** Hayseed president (Huey P. Long)
- **1931-1937:** Hayseed president (crisis response)
- **1937-1939+:** Hayseed president (or transition)

**Alignment:**
- CSA Hayseed resurgence (1925-1939) aligns with USA crisis (1929-1935)
- Hayseed protectionist policies could trigger trade war with USA
- Cross-border effects possible (trade war, border crisis, political instability)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Identify specific candidates** for each era
2. **Develop election narratives** (how each party wins/loses)
3. **Define policy details** (specific legislation, programs)
4. **Establish cross-border effects** (how Gentry vs. Hayseed affects USA)
5. **Connect to "Different Type of Crisis"** (CSA trade collapse, Hayseed response)

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING  
**Purpose:** Foundational framework for CSA presidents  
**Next:** Develop specific candidates and election narratives
