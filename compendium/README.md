# ASHVERSE COMPENDIUM

**Title:** Fire and Sovereignty: An Economic and Diplomatic History of the New Timeline, 1863-1939  
**Author:** Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Ph.D., D.Litt., C.S.A. (Ret.), F.R.Hist.S., etc., etc.  
**Publisher:** Appomattox Collegial Press  
**Publication Date:** March 1985 (in-universe)  
**Status:** IN DEVELOPMENT

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

This compendium is organized into **four parts** corresponding to the four-book cycle:

- **Part I: The Match (1863-1865)** - The War That Changed Everything (8 chapters)
- **Part II: The Fire (1865-1894)** - Economic Warfare and the Death of Slavery (8 chapters)
- **Part III: The Embers (1895-1919)** - Cooperation Despite Division (8 chapters)
- **Part IV: The Ashes (1920-1939)** - The Triad and the Coming Storm (8 chapters)

**Organization Philosophy:**
- **Chronological narrative** (primary) - Start with dramatic hook (Lee's death), build context through events
- **Topical chapters woven in** (secondary) - Introduce concepts AFTER reader has context (e.g., "The Three Nations" in Part III, not Part 0)
- **Reflections chapters** (tertiary) - End each part with summary and transition

**Why This Structure:**
- Starts with dramatic hook (not abstract methodology)
- Builds emotional investment before abstract concepts
- Makes "develop as you go" easier (write compendium chapters as you write novels)
- Better for Fairfax-Lockwood's voice (concrete commentary, not abstract overview)
- Information retention (learn mechanisms by experiencing them)

Each part contains 8 chapters, ending with a "Reflections" chapter that summarizes and transitions.

## EDITORIAL STRUCTURE

This compendium uses a **four-tier editorial system**:

1. **Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood** - Author, writes everything (often too much)
2. **Auto (A.U.T.O.)** - Archival Assistant, first line of defense against verbosity
3. **Kronvoldt (G.R.O.K.)** - Research Assistant, publishing reality check
4. **Claudette (C.B.O.)** - External Peer Reviewer, nuclear option

See `world-building/meta/compendium-editorial-structure.md` for full details.

## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Content Balance
- **85-90%:** Serious historical analysis, facts, data, timelines
- **10-15%:** Satirical framing (footnotes, chapter lead-ins, interludes)

### Voice Distribution
- **Main Text:** Serious, academic, informative
- **Footnotes:** Fairfax-Lockwood's satirical commentary
- **Editorial Notes:** Auto/Kronvoldt/Claudette interventions (bracketed)

### Chapter Structure
Each chapter should have:
1. **Epigraph** (historical quote, serious)
2. **Fairfax-Lockwood Commentary** (satirical take on epigraph)
3. **Main Text** (serious historical narrative)
4. **Footnotes** (Fairfax-Lockwood commentary, with occasional editorial interventions)

## STATUS

**Current Status:** Structure created, ready for content development  
**Writing Approach:** Develop chapters as you write the novels, adding compendium material as needed  
**Note:** The Table of Contents is a **LIVING DOCUMENT**. It will evolve as you write. Don't treat it as locked - use it as a starting framework.

**Note:** This is an explicit exception to the Golden Rule. The compendium structure is being developed alongside the novels to serve as a companion work.
