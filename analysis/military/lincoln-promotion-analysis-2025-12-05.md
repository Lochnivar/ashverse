# Would Lincoln Have Promoted Anyone to Overall Command? (NTL Analysis)

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Purpose:** Determine if Lincoln (or McClellan) would have promoted anyone to overall command in the NTL, given different circumstances

---

## THE QUESTION

**OTL:** Lincoln promoted Grant to Lieutenant General (command of all armies) in March 1864, after Vicksburg and Chattanooga.

**NTL Question:** Would Lincoln (or McClellan after November 1864) have promoted anyone to overall command in the NTL, given:
- Vicksburg still happens (July 1863)
- Eastern theater going very badly (Longstreet's raid, Meade's failures, Warren's disaster, Hancock wounded)
- McClellan elected November 1864 (peace platform)
- By March 1865, both armies disintegrating

---

## OTL CONTEXT: WHY LINCOLN PROMOTED GRANT

### **OTL Background: Halleck as General-in-Chief (1862-1864)**

**Henry W. Halleck ("Old Brains"):**
- Appointed General-in-Chief July 1862 (after McClellan's failures)
- Known as "Old Brains" but actually quite ineffective
- More of an administrator than a field commander
- Coordinated between theaters but lacked strategic vision
- Lincoln kept him because there was no better option... until Grant

### **OTL Reasons for Replacing Halleck with Grant (March 1864):**

1. **Halleck's Ineffectiveness:** Halleck was an administrator, not a strategic commander
2. **Grant's Success in the West:** Grant won Vicksburg (July 1863) and Chattanooga (November 1863)
3. **Need for Real Coordination:** Lincoln needed someone who could actually coordinate and lead, not just administrate
4. **Political Pressure:** Congress restored the rank of Lieutenant General specifically for Grant
5. **Strategic Vision:** Grant had a clear plan: "Fight it out on this line if it takes all summer"
6. **Lincoln's Trust:** Lincoln trusted Grant's determination and ability

### **OTL Result:**
- Halleck replaced by Grant as General-in-Chief (March 1864)
- Halleck becomes Chief of Staff (administrative role)
- Grant coordinates Overland Campaign (May-June 1864)
- Grant sieges Petersburg (June 1864 - April 1865)
- Grant accepts Lee's surrender (April 1865)

---

## NTL CONTEXT: DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES

### **NTL Differences:**

1. **Eastern Theater Failing:** Longstreet's raid (July-October 1863), Meade's failures, Warren's disaster (October-November 1863), Hancock wounded (July 1864)
2. **No "Second Gettysburg":** No decisive victory to rally Northern morale
3. **Political Collapse:** McClellan elected November 1864 on peace platform
4. **Armies Disintegrating:** By March 1865, both armies are falling apart
5. **Desperation:** Northern will to continue the war has collapsed

### **Key Question:**
Would Lincoln (or McClellan) still want/need a General-in-Chief in these circumstances?

---

## ANALYSIS: WOULD LINCOLN PROMOTE ANYONE?

### **Scenario 1: Lincoln Promotes Grant (March 1864, Like OTL)**

**Rationale:**
- Grant still wins Vicksburg (July 1863)
- Lincoln still needs coordination between theaters
- Grant is still the best candidate
- Congress might still restore Lieutenant General rank

**Plausibility:** 70%

**Strengths:**
- Grant's success at Vicksburg still happens
- Lincoln's need for coordination still exists
- Political pressure might still exist

**Weaknesses:**
- Eastern theater is different (no need for Overland Campaign?)
- Grant might not want to come East if Eastern theater is hopeless
- McClellan's election (November 1864) changes everything

**What Happens:**
- Grant promoted March 1864 (like OTL)
- Grant comes East, but Eastern theater is different
- Grant tries different strategy, fails or gets frustrated
- By March 1865, Grant desperate for one last throw

**Question:** Why would Grant wait until March 1865 for desperate gamble if he's been in command since March 1864?

---

### **Scenario 2: Lincoln Keeps Halleck (Doesn't Replace Him)**

**Rationale:**
- Halleck already General-in-Chief (since July 1862)
- Eastern theater is different (no need for aggressive strategy?)
- Lincoln might not want to make big changes before election
- Halleck is adequate for administrative coordination
- No clear replacement candidate (Grant might not want to come East)

**Plausibility:** 75%

**Strengths:**
- Halleck already in position (no promotion needed)
- Explains why Grant might not be in overall command
- Lincoln might not want to make big changes before election
- Halleck adequate for administrative role

**Weaknesses:**
- Halleck was ineffective (OTL Lincoln replaced him for a reason)
- Why would Lincoln keep an ineffective General-in-Chief?
- Grant is clearly the better candidate

**What Happens:**
- Halleck stays as General-in-Chief (1862-1865)
- Grant stays in West (no reason to call him East)
- Halleck coordinates administratively, but no strategic vision
- Eastern commanders (Meade, Warren, Hancock) handle the East
- By March 1865, all options exhausted, Grant called East as last resort

**Question:** Why would Lincoln keep Halleck if he's ineffective? Or is Halleck adequate for the NTL's different circumstances?

---

### **Scenario 2B: Lincoln Promotes Someone Else (Not Grant, Not Halleck)**

**Possible Candidates:**
- **Sherman:** Western success, but not as proven as Grant
- **Meade:** Eastern commander, but failing
- **Warren:** Young, aggressive, but inexperienced
- **Hancock:** Popular, but not yet in command

**Plausibility:** 20%

**Strengths:**
- Explains why Grant might not be in overall command
- Different candidate might have different approach

**Weaknesses:**
- Grant is clearly the best candidate (Vicksburg success)
- Why would Lincoln choose someone else?
- Political pressure would favor Grant

**What Happens:**
- Someone else promoted (Sherman? Meade? Warren?)
- Grant stays in West
- Different strategy fails
- By March 1865, Grant called East as last resort

**Question:** Who would Lincoln choose instead of Grant? Why?

---

### **Scenario 3: Lincoln Removes Halleck But Doesn't Replace Him**

**Rationale:**
- Halleck is ineffective, Lincoln removes him
- But no clear replacement candidate (Grant might not want to come East)
- Eastern theater is different (no need for aggressive General-in-Chief?)
- Political situation different (McClellan's election coming)
- Lincoln might not want to make a big decision before election
- After McClellan's election, peace talks begin, no need for General-in-Chief

**Plausibility:** 40%

**Strengths:**
- Explains why Grant might not be in overall command
- Lincoln removes ineffective Halleck, but doesn't replace him
- Political situation (McClellan's election) changes priorities

**Weaknesses:**
- Lincoln still needs coordination between theaters
- Why wouldn't Lincoln replace Halleck with Grant?
- Grant's success at Vicksburg might still demand promotion

**What Happens:**
- Halleck removed (maybe demoted to Chief of Staff, or removed entirely)
- No one promoted to overall command
- Grant stays in West
- Eastern commanders (Meade, Warren, Hancock) handle the East
- By March 1865, all options exhausted, Grant called East as last resort

**Question:** Why would Lincoln remove Halleck but not replace him with Grant?

---

### **Scenario 4: McClellan Promotes Someone (After November 1864)**

**Rationale:**
- McClellan elected November 1864 (peace platform)
- But peace talks might take time
- McClellan might want a General-in-Chief to handle military while he handles politics
- Or McClellan might not want a General-in-Chief (peace platform = no need for war coordination)

**Plausibility:** 40%

**Strengths:**
- Explains timing (after election)
- McClellan's peace platform might change priorities

**Weaknesses:**
- McClellan's peace platform = no need for General-in-Chief?
- Peace talks begin, no need for military coordination
- Why would McClellan promote anyone if he wants peace?

**What Happens:**
- McClellan takes office March 1865
- Either promotes someone (Grant?) or doesn't
- Peace talks begin, but Grant acts "rogue" for final gamble

**Question:** Would McClellan promote anyone if he's on a peace platform?

---

## RECOMMENDED SCENARIO: Scenario 2 (Lincoln Keeps Halleck)

### **Rationale:**

1. **Halleck Already in Position:** Halleck is already General-in-Chief (since July 1862)
2. **Eastern Theater Different:** No need for aggressive strategy, Halleck's administrative coordination might be adequate
3. **Political Situation:** McClellan's election coming (November 1864), Lincoln might not want to make big changes
4. **Grant Stays in West:** Grant continues Western operations, no reason to call him East
5. **Halleck Adequate:** For the NTL's different circumstances (defensive, administrative coordination), Halleck might be adequate
6. **After McClellan's Election:** Peace talks begin, no need for aggressive General-in-Chief
7. **March 1865 Desperation:** All options exhausted, Grant called East as last resort

### **Timeline:**

**July 1862:** Halleck becomes General-in-Chief (OTL, still happens in NTL)  
**July 1863:** Grant wins Vicksburg ✅  
**July 1863 - March 1864:** Grant continues in West (Chattanooga, etc.)  
**March 1864:** Lincoln does NOT replace Halleck with Grant (different circumstances, political situation, Halleck adequate for administrative role)  
**March 1864 - November 1864:** Halleck stays as General-in-Chief (administrative coordination), Grant stays in West, Eastern commanders handle the East  
**November 1864:** McClellan elected (peace platform)  
**March 1865:** McClellan takes office, peace talks begin, but Grant called East as last resort for final gamble

### **Why This Works:**

- **Explains Grant's absence:** Grant never promoted, stays in West (Halleck already in position)
- **Explains "rogue action":** Grant not officially in command, but takes charge anyway
- **Explains timing:** Grant called East in March 1865 as last resort
- **Consistent with timeline:** Halleck coordinates administratively, Eastern commanders (Meade, Warren, Hancock) handle the East, Grant stays in West until desperation
- **Halleck's Role:** Administrative coordination, not strategic command (adequate for NTL's different circumstances)

---

## ALTERNATIVE: Scenario 1 (Lincoln Promotes Grant, But Different Result)

### **Rationale:**

1. **Grant Still Best Candidate:** Vicksburg success, Lincoln's trust
2. **Lincoln Still Needs Coordination:** Between theaters, even if different strategy
3. **Grant Promoted March 1864:** Like OTL
4. **But Eastern Theater Different:** Grant tries different approach, fails or gets frustrated
5. **March 1865 Desperation:** Grant desperate for one last throw

### **Timeline:**

**July 1863:** Grant wins Vicksburg ✅  
**March 1864:** Grant promoted to General-in-Chief (like OTL)  
**March 1864 - March 1865:** Grant in overall command, but Eastern theater different, strategy fails  
**March 1865:** Grant desperate for one last throw, launches final gamble

### **Why This Might Not Work:**

- **Question:** Why would Grant wait until March 1865 for desperate gamble if he's been in command since March 1864?
- **Answer:** Grant might have tried different strategies, all failed, by March 1865 he's desperate

## KEY QUESTIONS FOR USER

1. **Would Lincoln replace Halleck with Grant?** (March 1864, like OTL)
   - If yes: Why would Grant wait until March 1865 for desperate gamble?
   - If no: Why not? What prevents it?

2. **Would Lincoln keep Halleck?** (Don't replace him)
   - If yes: Why? Is Halleck adequate for NTL's different circumstances?
   - If no: Why remove him?

3. **Would Lincoln replace Halleck with someone else?** (Not Grant)
   - If yes: Who? Why?
   - If no: Why not?

4. **What about McClellan?** (After November 1864)
   - Would McClellan keep/replace Halleck?
   - Or would peace platform mean no need for General-in-Chief?

## RECOMMENDED ANSWER: Lincoln Keeps Halleck, Grant Acts "Rogue"

### **The Scenario:**

1. **Halleck Stays in Position:** Halleck remains General-in-Chief (since July 1862)
2. **Grant Gets Frustrated:** Grant sees Halleck's ineffectiveness, Eastern theater failing, McClellan's peace platform
3. **Grant's Decision:** "Halleck doesn't have the balls, it's now or never" - Grant acts like he has authority (but doesn't actually have it)
4. **Grant's "Rogue Action":** Grant assembles his patchwork army and launches the final gamble, acting as if he has authority
5. **March 1865 Desperation:** "Now or never" - Grant knows this is his last chance before peace talks

### **Why This Works:**

1. **Halleck Already in Position:** No promotion needed, Halleck stays as General-in-Chief
2. **Grant's Frustration:** Grant sees Halleck's ineffectiveness, Eastern theater failing, McClellan's peace platform
3. **Grant's Character:** Grant is determined, frustrated, takes charge - "Halleck doesn't have the balls, it's now or never"
4. **Grant's "Rogue Action":** Grant acts without official authority, but takes charge anyway
5. **Timing:** March 1865 - "now or never" before peace talks begin

### **Result:**

- Halleck stays as General-in-Chief (administrative coordination, but ineffective)
- Grant never gets overall command (Halleck already in position)
- Grant stays in West (Vicksburg, Chattanooga, etc.) until March 1865
- Grant gets frustrated: "Halleck doesn't have the balls, it's now or never"
- Grant acts "rogue" (not officially in command, but takes charge anyway)
- Grant assembles patchwork army and launches final gamble at Appomattox

### **Halleck's Role in NTL:**

- **Administrative Coordination:** Coordinates between theaters, handles logistics, manages communications
- **Not Strategic Command:** Doesn't make strategic decisions, doesn't lead campaigns
- **Ineffective:** Halleck is adequate for administrative role, but lacks strategic vision
- **Why Lincoln Keeps Him:** No clear replacement candidate (Grant might not want to come East), political situation (election coming), different circumstances (no need for aggressive General-in-Chief)
- **Grant's Frustration:** Grant sees Halleck's ineffectiveness and decides to act on his own

### **Grant's "Rogue Action" Narrative:**

**Grant's Frustration (March 1865):**
- Grant sees Halleck's ineffectiveness
- Grant sees Eastern theater failing (Meade, Warren, Hancock all failed)
- Grant sees McClellan's peace platform (war has expiration date)
- Grant decides: "Halleck doesn't have the balls, it's now or never"

**Grant's Decision:**
- Grant acts like he has authority (but doesn't actually have it)
- Grant assembles patchwork army (65,000 men from remnants, garrisons, Western reinforcements)
- Grant launches final gamble at Appomattox
- Grant knows this is his last chance before peace talks begin

**Grant's Character:**
- Determined, frustrated, takes charge
- "Halleck doesn't have the balls, it's now or never"
- Acts without official authority, but takes charge anyway
- Desperate last throw before peace talks

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Recommendation:** Use Scenario 3 (Lincoln Never Promotes Anyone) as base, but need user confirmation on:
1. Would Lincoln promote Grant? (March 1864)
2. Would Lincoln promote anyone else?
3. Would McClellan promote anyone? (After November 1864)
4. Why would Grant be called East in March 1865? (Last resort?)
