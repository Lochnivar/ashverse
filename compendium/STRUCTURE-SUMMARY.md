## SUBJECT ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

- Events flow chronologically within chapters
- Chapters build on previous chapters
- Clear 76-year progression

### Secondary: Thematic
- Economic themes (raids, boycott, cotton glut, cooperation)
- Political themes (elections, treaties, parties)
- Military themes (war, raids, enforcement)
- Diplomatic themes (treaties, Concord, California)

### Tertiary: Character Focus
- Key historical figures in relevant chapters
- Character arcs tracked across chapters
- Biographical details in footnotes/appendix
- Family perspectives (Fairfax, Haskell) woven throughout

---

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: The War (Start Here)
**Part I: The Match** - Start with dramatic hook, build context

**Recommended First Chapters:**
1. Chapter 1: Introduction - The Point of Divergence (PoD, brief methodology)
2. Chapter 2: The Torch Passes (Lee's death, Longstreet's decision)
3. Chapter 6: Grant's Final Gamble (Already workshopped)

**Why:** Start with dramatic hook (Lee's death), build emotional investment, then analyze

**Recommended First Chapters:**
1. Chapter 2: The Torch Passes (Lee's death, Longstreet's decision - most critical)
2. Chapter 6: The Treaty of Cincinnati (War's end - closure)
3. Chapter 5: Grant's Final Gamble (Already workshopped)

**Why:** These establish the foundation. Everything else builds on them.

---

### Phase 2: Core Thesis
**Part II: The Fire** - Document economic warfare, explain slavery's death

**Recommended Next Chapters:**
1. Chapter 8: The Toombs Act and the Global Boycott (The trigger)
2. Chapter 11: The Last Chain Falls (The breaking point)
3. Chapter 9: The Raider Economy (The mechanism)

**Why:** These establish the core thesis - "slavery dies of economics, not morality"

---

### Phase 3: Transition
**Part III: The Embers** - Show cooperation developing, document political changes

**Recommended Chapters:**
1. Chapter 13: The New Century (Cooperation begins)
2. Chapter 17: The American Concord (Framework established)

**Why:** These show the transition from conflict to cooperation

---

### Phase 4: Reflection
**Part IV: The Ashes** - Show triad maturing, reflect on consequences

**Recommended Chapters:**
1. Chapter 23: Reflections on the Ashes (The conclusion)
2. Chapter 21: California's Pacific Empire (The superpower)

**Why:** These provide the reflection and show what has been built

---

## WRITING WORKFLOW RECOMMENDATION

### As You Write the Novels:
1. **When you need to explain something** → Write a compendium section
2. **When you work out world-building** → Document it in compendium
3. **When you need to clarify a mechanism** → Add economic/political analysis
4. **When you want to add depth** → Write a character-focused section

### Chapter Development Process:
1. **Copy chapter-template.md** → Rename for your chapter
2. **Fill in the outline** → What time period, key events, themes
3. **Write the epigraph** → Find a quote that captures the essence
4. **Write Fairfax-Lockwood's commentary** → 2-4 paragraphs, satirical
5. **Write the main text** → Serious, academic, comprehensive
6. **Add footnotes** → Fairfax-Lockwood commentary, editorial interventions
7. **Review balance** → 85-90% serious, 10-15% satirical
