# Atlanta Campaign: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Atlanta Campaign timeline and outcome (1864-1865)

---

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Atlanta Campaign occurs in NTL with different outcome than OTL

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Campaign timeline is plausible
- Siege outcome is realistic
- Western Theater operates independently
- Campaign serves narrative function

---

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Timeline: May 1864 - January 1865
- Force sizes: Sherman ~100k, Hood ~65k (after Johnston replaced)
- Campaign type: Siege (not capture)
- Outcome: Ambiguous - neither side wins decisively
- Duration: 4 months siege

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Sherman captured Atlanta September 1864
- OTL: Campaign was decisive Union victory
- NTL: Campaign is ambiguous stalemate
- NTL: Siege never results in capture

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain historical realism
- Must align with Eastern Theater timeline
- Must serve narrative function
- Must account for Hood's aggressive nature

---

## RESULTS

**Overall Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)

**Key Findings:**

**Campaign Timeline:**
- May 1864: Sherman begins advance from Chattanooga
- June-July 1864: Sherman advances, Johnston retreats (similar to OTL)
- July 17, 1864: Hood replaces Johnston (CSA seizes opportunity)
- August-November 1864: Siege of Atlanta (4 months, never falls)
- January 1865: Sherman withdraws (peace negotiations beginning)
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Timeline realistic, aligns with Eastern Theater

**Siege Outcome:**
- Hood defends aggressively (character consistent)
- Sherman unable to capture city (defensive advantage)
- 4-month siege creates stalemate
- Ambiguous outcome serves narrative
- **Plausibility: 87%** - Siege realistic, outcome plausible

**Western Theater Independence:**
- Campaign operates independently from Eastern Theater
- No direct coordination with Grant/Hancock
- Different timeline and outcome
- **Plausibility: 90%** - Realistic given theater separation

**Narrative Function:**
- Creates ambiguous Western outcome
- Sets up Sherman's march to Appomattox
- Shows CSA resilience
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Serves story purpose

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 88% (OTL campaign patterns applicable)
- Timeline Consistency: 90% (Aligns with Eastern Theater)
- Military Feasibility: 87% (Siege realistic)
- Narrative Function: 88% (Serves story purpose)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Hood defends aggressively - **Justification:** Character consistent, OTL pattern
- Siege never results in capture - **Justification:** Defensive advantage, narrative need
- Campaign operates independently - **Justification:** Realistic theater separation

**Limitations:**
- Different from OTL outcome
- Requires accepting ambiguous stalemate
- Timeline requires careful coordination with Eastern Theater

**Edge Cases:**
- What if Atlanta falls? → **Not tested:** Assumes stalemate
- What if campaign ends earlier? → **Handled:** Timeline allows for variation

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Strong historical precedents, timeline consistent, military feasibility good. Ambiguous outcome serves narrative function and aligns with established timeline.
