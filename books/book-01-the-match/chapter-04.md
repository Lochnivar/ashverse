Daniel's Brigade, Rodes Division, II Corps, ANV
North of Carlisle, Pennsylvania

Major General Robert Rodes pulled his horse up at the front of the army march and dismouted.  

"Nervous, Junius?" he said quietly to Brigider General Junius Daniel, one of his generals, currently at the head of the march.

"The Lord commands that we shall not bear false witness, so it would be sin if I said no, sir".  Both men chuckled at the joke and quickly sobered up.  "Can I be honest with you, Robert?"

Though technically his junior officer, both men were of about the same age and the informality felt natural.

"Always," Rodes said.

"I don't think I've ever been this nervous about a march."  Daniel pulled his hat off and let it swing in his left hand as his right rested on the sword.  "I expected a real dust up in Gettysburg.  I haven't quite adjusted to the idea of not being in a battle this morning."

"I understand that," Rodes nodded.  "But, you might get your chance when we get to Harrisburg.  Lord knows Carlisle didn't put up any fight.  Harrisburg is the capital."

Daniel nodded and a brief, uncomfortable silence threatened.

"I see your brigade is just about ready to lead us to glory, Junius?"  Rodes motioned to the lines forming behind them.  Just over seven thousand men in rebel gray, and a few others in butternut brown.

"Just about sir."  Daniel nodded and straightened his spine, his pride in his brigade was evident.  "Give us fifteen minutes and we'll step off smartly."

"See you in Harrisburg then.  Give them hell, Junius."  Rodes extended a hand and Daniel shook it."

Leister House
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

Almost twenty-four hours later, Gibbon and Haskell still noted the hornet's nest activity of the previous day, but this activity had context.  Haskell could read the concern, and distaste, on the faces of the men entering and leaving the Leister House.  Both emotions were locked firmly behind granite military discipline, but a veteran like Haskell could see the signs.  All men had them and even rigid military training couldn't remove the tells completely.

"I believe that we're not going to find satisfaction this morning, Frank." Gibbon's tone seemed to indicate that the general had noticed the difference as well.  After last night's mild reprimand, such a comment only highlighted Gibbon's internal stress and disappointment.  Haskell only nodded, not trusting himself to speak.

General Meade stood in the house, his coat on and looking better than he had yesterday.  He didn't look rested, but his eyes were once again clear and reasonably alert.  Maps and reports were strewn across the table and a tin cup of coffee steamed at the near corner.  His staff crowded around the table, but Major General Butterfield noticed Gibbon and touched Meade on the forearm to get his attention.

Meade looked up and motioned Gibbon forward.  The staff parted the way and made room for Gibbon at the table.

"Good morning to you, General.  How are your men?"  Meade asked.

"Rested sir, and eager for a fight" Gibbon said.  "We're ready to pursue."

Meade flinched, just a bit.  Gibbon hadn't meant for the response to be an insult, but Meade obviously took the reference to heart.

"I appreciate the eagerness of your men, General Gibbon," Meade's voice was a touch more frosty.  "However, I'm still not fully convinced that Lee has given up the battle here.  I've ordered Buford to report movements by noon and I'll be riding to see the lines personally in about thirty minutes or so."

"I believe the prudent thing to do is to begin prepping for departure, but let's not break down the lines quite yet.  I'm moving Slocum and Sykes north from the round tops south of here.  One thing we're positive is that Lee isn't to our south and we need those men for reserves if he makes a sudden strike at our lines."

"Aye sir." Gibbon gave a quick salute and turned.  Haskell followed him and waited until they had left out of earshot before cursing a blue streak his priest wouldn't have approved of.

"Patience, Frank." Gibbon said.

"He's jumping at ghosts, sir!"

"Yes, but these are Chancelorsville ghosts, a very deadly and dangerous type."  Gibbon sighed.  "You know my feelings on this, Frank, but can we afford another disaster like that?  It may be frustrating, but what harm can waiting to make sure Lee isn't planning something?"

Little Round Top
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

The young courier huffed as he finally crested the hill and looked about.  He found Chamberlain by the insignia on his coat and trotted over.

"Colonel Chamberlain?"  He quickly saluted.

"Yes, that's me."  Chamberlain returned the salute.

"That's quite the climb, sir!"  The youth handed over a folded piece of paper.  "Orders from Colonel Vincent."

Chamberlain took the paper and nodded to the nearest cookfire.

"Thank you, have a quick cup while I read this."

The courier nodded his thanks and Chamberlain unfolded the paper.  The orders were what he had half expected and Chamberlain felt his gut clench.  

Last night had been -- anticlimactic.  The rebel assault never materialized but the constant need for vigilance had robbed the men of their rest.  The lack of cookfires down the hill had actually been more disquieting than they would have been.  Cookfires would have meant the rebels were settling down for the night.  Chamberlain himself had been awake until well after midnight scanning the rebel lines, looking for the anticipated assault, before Tom and Sergeant Tozier had respectfully, but firmly, convinced him to get to his bedroll.

The men of the 2nd Maine hadn't been hesitant to express their opinions.  Tom and the sergeants had done their best to segregate them to keep discipline high, but even Chamberlain had overheard scattered conversations about "building breastworks to defend against fucking squirrels".  These orders would only make that feeling of frustration much worse.

Tom had noticed the arrival of the courier and had risen from his own campfire to join Chamberlain.

"Orders?"  He asked.

Chamberlain handed the orders over to Tom.

"Yes, Tom, we're moving out.  General Meade's staff has determined there are no rebels south of here and we're moving out to be a reserve up near Cemetery Hill."

Tom cursed and read the orders while Chamberlain motioned for the courier.

"Give Colonel Vincent my compliments and acknowledgements.  The 20th will be on the move as soon as we can."

The courier gave one final salute and a quick stop at the cookfire to thank them for the coffee, then he was back down the hill.  Chamberlain stood for a moment, giving the downhill a final clear sweep.  The breastworks they had spent hours on, and convinced the 2nd Maine to assist with, stood empty.  A monument to a night's frustration.

"Fucking squirrels", he growled to himself.

Harrisburg City Hall
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Mayor Augustus L. Roumfort closed his eyes and tried not to curse as he rubbed the bridge of his nose.  The July summer sun beat hot through the open window of his office in Harriburg City Hall.  Sweat trickled under his suit coat, the heat unmitigated by any hint of wind from outside.  He should have walked about in shirt sleeves, leaving the coat on the table, but the messenger from this rebel general Longstreet made this a more formal setting, requiring the damned coat for the sake of propriety.

The messenger, a major in worn rebel gray finery, had been courtesy itself.  But, Roumfort could see the contempt in the man's blue eyes and that didn't help his mood at the moment.

Another deep breath and Roumfort turned from the window to face the major again.  He clasped his hands behind his back, an old habit from his West Point days.

"My apologies for making you wait, Major..."

"Fairfax, sir,"  The major came to something of an attention, his voice as absent of any of the contempt that Roumfort thought he saw in the man's face.  Perhaps, just maybe, Roumfort had been a little ... choleric in his assessment of the man's attitude.  Lord only knew how much the stress of the situation was affecting him and Roumfort knew he didn't have the best of tempers.

"Major Fairfax, yes."  Roumfort nodded, fixing the man's name in his mind.  "You have a message from General Lee?"

"I'm sorry mayor, I'm an aide to General Longstreet.  General Lee passed two days ago, in Gettysburg.  General Longstreet is now in command of the Army of Northern Virginia."

"General Longstreet, very well.  Your message?"

"He requests the honor of your surrender." Major Fairfax said.  "He offers generous terms.  You will be required, of course, to hand over any arms or funds that are present in the city and to supply the army at need.  In exchange, you and your city will be compensated with Confederate scrip and there will be no pillaging or unrest from his army, enforced by the lash and the noose, if necessary.  You have one hour to accept."

Roumfort paused for another count of ten and tried not to express the three curses boiling in his chest.

The first curse was for the governor of Pennsylvania, Andrew Curtin.  The coward had run off late last month as soon as word of Lee's army of ravening barbarians had reached Harrisburg.  Curtin might prate about his fine Republican ideals, but when it came down to it, it had been the Republicans, and their man in Washington, that had gotten them into this mess.  As soon as the war even hinted at coming into their homes, and they ran, leaving a Democrat to pick up the pieces.  In his more honest moments, Roumfort might readily acknowledge that Curtin had a responsibility for the state as a whole and Harrisburg was properly Roumfort's balliwick.  But, that was cold comfort in the face of an entire Southern army approaching from the south.

The second curse was for his predecessor, William Kepner.  True, the man had been a proper Democrat, which saved him from the fires of damnation, but he had been absolutely worthless in preparing the city during his time as mayor.  A war raging not two states over, one of those states a very narrow divide of mountainous land, and the man hadn't even so much as begun to dig fortifications or increase the militia.  Again, his ineptitude left Roumfort in a very dire situation.

The third curse, and only saved by the rules of proper ettiqute that must be observed at tense moments like this, was reserved solely for that bastard of a rebel general Longstreet.  How dare the man continue to invade the North?  Lee had been bad enough, the man had been a barely pent up pitbull at the best of times, but this Longstreet was supposedly of a different, more sanguine cut.  He should have rightly turned back to defending Virginia when he received command.  But, no.  The man had promptly turned his tail away from Meade's army and ran for a less well defended town.  Roumfort wasn't sure if that was cowardice or incompetence.

"I don't know if I can accept those terms, Major."  Roumfort's face hardened.  "My constituency would not appreciate any decision to surrender to a foreign army.  Especially a unilateral surrender without the advice and consent of my council.  One hour is hardly enough time to properly consider these terms."

"General Longstreet was quite insistent, sir." Fairfax's face was still respectful but there was no give in those eyes.  "I was specifically ordered to inform you that, should you attempt to negotiate for an extension, I was to mention that these terms were not negotiable.  General Longstreet regrets the strategic position that forces him to make such unorthodox demands.  He is quite aware that General Meade has an army in Gettysburg, as you are aware of yourself.  That army may be marching north at this moment.  Giving you the time you need to properly consider these terms would be criminal misconduct in light of that threat.  General Longstreet requires the defenses that you have so competently dug for his own defense once the Army of the Potomac arrives."

Major Fairfax pointed at the framed diploma of the United States Military Academy at West Point, class of 1817, that was hanging on the office wall.

"Your consituency is also not aware of exactly how approximately four thousand militiamen would stand against a full army of veteran soldiers.  I have no doubt that your militia would fight bravely.  However, we both know exactly what will happen."

Silence hung for just a moment, thick in the air.

"General Longstreet requires those fortifications that you have dug.  I'm afraid, I must insist."

Roumfort looked at the diploma on the wall.

Class of 1817. Forty-six years ago. He'd been twenty-one years old, fresh from four years under Thayer, ready to serve his country.

He'd never imagined that country would tear itself apart.

Or that his West Point education would be used against him by another officer to force his surrender.

But Fairfax was right. Damn him, he was right.

Four thousand militia. Maybe fifty-five thousand veterans approaching from the south.

Roumfort had studied tactics. He'd taught tactics at his own military school for decades. He knew the mathematics.

Fifteen minutes. Maybe twenty if his militia were very brave and very lucky.

"What guarantees can General Longstreet offer?" he asked quietly, the political rhetoric abandoned. "You say no pillaging. How can I trust that?"

Fairfax's expression softened slightly—not sympathy, but professional respect.

"General Longstreet's word is absolute, sir. He's already issued orders: any man who molests a citizen or destroys property without authorization will be hanged. No exceptions. The general is... particular about discipline."

"And civilian authority?"

"Will be retained in municipal matters, sir. You'll continue as mayor. Confederate provost marshals will handle military security, but you'll administer the city. The general wishes this occupation to be as... orderly as possible."

Roumfort walked to the window, looking south toward Camp Hill where his fortifications waited.

His fortifications.

That he'd designed.

That he'd supervised the construction of.

That he'd positioned the militia to defend.

That he was about to hand over to the Confederate army.

"Major Fairfax," he said without turning around, "does General Longstreet know who I am?"

"Sir?"

"Does he know that Harrisburg's mayor is United States Military Academy Class of 1817?"

There was a pause.

"I... I don't believe so, sir. He sent me to negotiate with the civilian authority. He didn't mention your military background."

"Then you will convey something to him, Major." Roumfort turned from the window. "You will tell General Longstreet that Augustus L. Roumfort, Class of 1817, accepts his terms. Harrisburg will surrender without resistance at two o'clock this afternoon."

Fairfax's eyes widened.

"Sir... the general will want to meet you personally. Class of 1817... sir, you served under—"

"Jackson. Scott. Both." Roumfort's voice was hard. "Long time ago. Different army. Different war."

"Yes sir." Fairfax came to attention—proper military attention, not the casual courtesy he'd shown before. "Sir, I'll convey your message to General Longstreet immediately. He'll... he'll be honored to meet you."

"Will he, Major? Will a Confederate general be honored to meet the Union mayor who surrendered Pennsylvania's capital without a fight?"

Fairfax met his eyes.

"Sir, General Longstreet will be honored to meet a fellow officer who made the professional choice. Who saved his city. Who understood the mathematics and acted accordingly."

He paused.

"The general is not... like General Lee, sir. He doesn't seek glory. He seeks results. You're giving him what he needs—Harrisburg's fortifications, without bloodshed, quickly enough to prepare for Meade. That's professional soldiering, sir. Not cowardice."

Roumfort looked at the young major—probably thirty years old, maybe less. Young enough to be his grandson.

"How old are you, Major?"

"Thirty-two, sir."

"What class?"

"VMI, sir. Class of '52."

"Virginia Military Institute. Good school."

"Yes sir. Learned tactics from men who studied under you, sir. Your textbooks from the military school you founded... they're still in use."

Roumfort closed his eyes.

His textbooks. Teaching young officers like this major how to win wars.

And now one of those officers was accepting his surrender.

"Tell General Longstreet I'll meet him at the capitol building at two o'clock to formalize the surrender," he said quietly. "And Major?"

"Sir?"

"The fortifications are well-prepared. Good enfilade positions, supporting works, proper fields of fire. Thayer's principles throughout. When General Meade arrives, General Longstreet will find them... adequate for his purposes."

Fairfax smiled slightly—the first break in his professional demeanor.

"I'm certain he will, sir. And I'm certain he'll appreciate the professional quality of the work."

"Professional," Roumfort repeated bitterly. "Is that what we're calling this?"

"Sir, you're saving lives. Your militia's lives. Your citizens' lives. That's what officers do when glory isn't possible."

"And when is glory possible, Major?"

Fairfax's smile faded.

"I don't know, sir. I'm still trying to figure that out myself."

He offered a bow—deeper than protocol required.

"Thank you for your cooperation, sir. General Longstreet will be informed immediately. Good day."

And then he was gone, leaving Roumfort alone with his diploma, his decision, and the knowledge that in two hours, a Confederate army would occupy Harrisburg.

Tomorrow, Independence Day, 1863, the Confederate Flag would fly over the capitol of Pennsylvania.

Class of 1817 had taught him many things.

Today, it had taught him the hardest: that sometimes the most professional decision is the one that feels most like surrender.

He sat at his desk and began drafting the orders to his militia commanders.

Stand down. Go home. The mayor has surrendered.

The pen felt very heavy in his hand.
