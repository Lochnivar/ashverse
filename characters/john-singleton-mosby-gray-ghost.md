- **Hated whiskey, never drank**
- **Distinctive Appearance:**
  - Wore a gray cape with scarlet lining
  - White plume in his hat
  - Made him unmistakable
- **Nickname:** "The Gray Ghost" (by Northern papers) – appeared and vanished like smoke
- **Obsessed with legality:** Carried copies of the Lieber Code, insisted his men obey the rules of war (no looting civilians, no torture)

- **Served as U.S. consul to Hong Kong** (1878-1885)

## How Mosby Fits Your NTL (1865-1900)

**Because he's still alive and only 32 when your peace treaty is signed, he's the perfect bridge character between the war, the raids, and the new order.**

### Most Believable Arc

#### 1865-1872: The Raider Hunter
- **Refuses to surrender**, keeps his Rangers together as "irregular cavalry" hunting raiders in northern Virginia
- **Becomes the Confederacy's most effective (and most hated) anti-raider commander**
- Because he knows every trick the raiders use (he invented half of them)

#### 1872-1885: The Gray Lawman
- **Richmond finally offers him a federal marshal's star** to bring order to the border counties
- **He accepts on condition** he can keep his old Rangers as deputies
- **Turns the "Gray Ghost" legend into the "Gray Lawman"**
- Still riding at night, still appearing out of nowhere, but now hanging raiders instead of Yankees

#### 1885-1900: The Reluctant Abolition Enforcer
- **Appointed first Confederate member** of the Joint USA–CSA Free Labor Certification Board's inspection corps
- **Spends fifteen years** riding plantations with a Yankee partner, revolver on hip
- **Certifying bales** and quietly making sure no one ever puts chains on another human being in his jurisdiction again
- **Retires 1900**, writes a bestselling memoir titled *The War, the Raiders, and the Law* – basically the Confederate version of a Western sheriff's autobiography

#### Death (1916)
- **Dies at age 82**, still wearing the gray cape
- **Buried with full military honors from BOTH nations**

## Why Mosby Works

1. **Real historical figure** – readers get instant recognition
2. **Charismatic** – the "Gray Ghost" legend is already established
3. **Can evolve naturally** – from partisan ranger → raider-hunter → reluctant abolition enforcer without ever feeling forced
4. **Perfect age** – 32 in 1865, alive through the entire timeline
5. **Bridge character** – connects the war, the raids, and the new order
