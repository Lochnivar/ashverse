# Japan and Tojo's Extremism: Would CA-Style Diplomacy Moderate It?

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Question:** Was Japanese imperialism under Tojo inevitable given CA-style diplomacy and the lack of aggravating events such as the Washington Naval Treaty? Would Tojo's extremism be moderated in the NTL?

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Short Answer:** Japanese imperialism was likely **inevitable** (resource needs, military factionalism, economic pressures), but Tojo's **specific extremism** would be **significantly moderated** in the NTL.

**Key Factors:**
- **Imperialism:** 90% likely (driven by resource needs, not Western slights)
- **Tojo's Extremism:** 60-70% likely (vs. 95% in OTL) - significantly reduced
- **Moderating Factors:** CA-style diplomacy, no Washington Naval Treaty, no Immigration Act of 1924, California as oil supplier

## 1. WHAT DROVE TOJO'S RISE? (OTL Analysis)

### 1.1 The Man Himself

**Hideki Tojo (1884-1948):**
- Army officer, bureaucrat, ultra-nationalist
- Rose through military ranks (1920s-1930s)
- Prime Minister (1941-1944)
- Symbol of Japanese militarism and expansionism
- Executed for war crimes (1948)

**Key Traits:**
- Ultra-nationalist ideology
- Military-first thinking
- Expansionist worldview
- Willingness to use extreme force
- Anti-Western sentiment

### 1.2 The Historical Context (OTL 1920s-1941)

**What Created Tojo's Extremism:**

| Factor | OTL Impact | How It Created Extremism |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Washington Naval Treaty (1922)** | Limited Japan to 60% of US/UK tonnage | Seen as racist insult, "second-class power" status |
| **Immigration Act of 1924** | Banned Japanese immigration to U.S. | Explicitly racist, "Yellow Peril" panic, national humiliation |
| **Great Depression (1929)** | Economic collapse, resource scarcity | Military saw expansion as only solution |
| **Manchurian Incident (1931)** | Military acted without government approval | Military factionalism, civilian government weak |
| **Oil Embargo (1940-1941)** | U.S. cut 80% of Japan's oil | Forced "fight or die" choice, no off-ramp |
| **Military Factionalism** | Army vs. Navy, moderates vs. extremists | Tojo's faction won by promising "glory" |

**The Critical Chain:**
1. **1922:** Washington Naval Treaty → Japan feels insulted
2. **1924:** Immigration Act → Japan feels racially rejected
3. **1929:** Great Depression → Economic desperation
4. **1931:** Manchurian Incident → Military takes control
5. **1937:** China War → Military committed, can't back down
6. **1940-1941:** Oil Embargo → No choice but war
7. **1941:** Tojo becomes PM → Extremism institutionalized

## 2. NTL MODERATING FACTORS

### 2.1 CA-Style Diplomacy (1873-1939)

**What It Means:**
- **No moralizing** - California doesn't lecture Japan
- **No racial panic** - "Yellow Peril" never takes root in California
- **Pragmatic accommodation** - "We sell to whoever pays"
- **Respectful treatment** - Japan treated as equal partner, not inferior
- **Economic integration** - Japanese capital, labor, trade welcomed

**Specific NTL Differences:**

| OTL Event | NTL Version | Impact on Japan |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Washington Naval Treaty (1922)** | **Doesn't happen** - No unified U.S. to negotiate, California has different priorities | No "second-class power" insult |
| **Immigration Act (1924)** | **Doesn't happen** - California has open-door policy, no federal ban | No racial humiliation |
| **Oil Embargo (1940-1941)** | **Doesn't happen** - California keeps selling oil | No "fight or die" choice |
| **Moral Condemnation** | **Doesn't happen** - California doesn't moralize | No "Western hypocrisy" narrative |

### 2.2 The Washington Naval Treaty (OTL 1922)

**What It Was:**
- Naval arms limitation treaty
- Japan limited to 60% of US/UK tonnage
- Seen as racist insult in Japan
- Created "second-class power" status
- Fueled military resentment

**Why It Doesn't Happen in NTL:**
- No unified U.S. to negotiate (fractured, broke)
- California has different priorities (trade, not arms control)
- No British-U.S. alliance to pressure Japan
- Japan-CA relationship is bilateral, not multilateral

**Impact:**
- **No "second-class power" insult**
- **No naval inferiority complex**
- **Less military resentment against "the West"**
- **More room for diplomatic solutions**

### 2.3 The Immigration Act of 1924 (OTL)

**What It Was:**
- U.S. federal law banning Japanese immigration
- Explicitly racist ("Yellow Peril" panic)
- National humiliation for Japan
- Created deep resentment

**Why It Doesn't Happen in NTL:**
- California has open-door policy (1884 Immigration Accord)
- No federal U.S. ban (fractured government, different priorities)
- California welcomes Japanese capital and labor
- "Yellow Peril" panic never takes root

**Impact:**
- **No racial humiliation
- **Less resentment against "the West"**
- **More economic integration**
- **Better diplomatic relations**

### 2.4 California as Oil Supplier (1931-1941)

**OTL:** U.S. embargoed Japan's oil (1940-1941), forcing "fight or die" choice

**NTL:** California keeps selling oil at premium prices, providing off-ramp

**Impact:**
- **No "fight or die" choice**
- **More diplomatic flexibility**
- **Less military desperation**
- **Moderates can argue for negotiation**

## 3. WOULD JAPANESE IMPERIALISM BE INEVITABLE?

### 3.1 The Case for "Yes" (90% Likely)

**Inevitable Factors (Independent of Western Actions):**

1. **Resource Needs**
   - Japan lacks oil, iron, rubber, food
   - Industrialization requires resources
   - Expansion is logical solution
   - **Not driven by Western slights**

2. **Military Factionalism**
   - Army vs. Navy competition
   - Moderates vs. extremists
   - Military culture of expansion
   - **Internal dynamics, not external**

3. **Economic Pressures**
   - Great Depression hits Japan hard
   - Resource scarcity
   - Need for markets
   - **Economic logic, not ideology**

4. **Historical Momentum**
   - Japan already expanding (1895, 1905, 1910)
   - Manchuria (1931) was logical next step
   - **Continuation of existing policy**

5. **Geopolitical Logic**
   - Weak China (civil war, corruption)
   - Weak European colonies (Britain/France distracted)
   - Opportunity for expansion
   - **Strategic calculation, not revenge**

**Verdict:** ✅ **90% LIKELY** - Japanese imperialism would happen regardless of Western actions. It's driven by resource needs, economic pressures, and strategic logic, not Western slights.

### 3.2 The Case for "No" (10% Likely)

**Possible Alternatives:**
- Economic integration with California provides resources
- Diplomatic solutions through CA-style accommodation
- Less military factionalism without Western insults
- More moderate leadership without humiliation

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **10% LIKELY** - Possible but unlikely. Imperialism is too deeply embedded in Japanese military culture and economic needs.

## 4. WOULD TOJO'S EXTREMISM BE MODERATED?

### 4.1 The Case for "Yes, Significantly Moderated" (60-70% Likely)

**Moderating Factors:**

1. **No Washington Naval Treaty Insult**
   - Less military resentment
   - Less "second-class power" complex
   - More room for diplomatic solutions
   - **Reduces extremist narrative**

2. **No Immigration Act Humiliation**
   - Less racial resentment
   - Better relations with "the West"
   - More economic integration
   - **Reduces anti-Western sentiment**

3. **California as Oil Supplier**
   - No "fight or die" choice
   - More diplomatic flexibility
   - Moderates can argue for negotiation
   - **Reduces military desperation**

4. **CA-Style Diplomacy**
   - Respectful treatment
   - No moralizing
   - Economic integration
   - **Reduces "Western hypocrisy" narrative**

5. **Less Military Factionalism**
   - Without Western insults, moderates have more leverage
   - Less "glory through war" rhetoric
   - More room for diplomatic solutions
   - **Reduces extremist faction's power**

**Result:**
- Tojo's faction still exists, but **less powerful**
- Moderates have **more leverage**
- Military expansion happens, but **less extreme**
- War still possible, but **more diplomatic off-ramps**

**Verdict:** ✅ **60-70% LIKELY** - Tojo's extremism would be significantly moderated, but not eliminated. Imperialism would still happen, but with more restraint and diplomatic options.

### 4.2 The Case for "No, Still Extreme" (30-40% Likely)

**Why Extremism Might Persist:**

1. **Internal Military Culture**
   - Expansionism is deeply embedded
   - Military factionalism is internal, not external
   - Tojo's faction might still win
   - **Independent of Western actions**

2. **Resource Needs Still Drive Expansion**
   - Japan still needs oil, iron, rubber
   - Economic pressures still exist
   - Expansion is still logical
   - **Not driven by Western slights**

3. **Historical Momentum**
   - Japan already expanding (1895-1931)
   - Manchuria (1931) was logical next step
   - **Continuation of existing policy**

4. **Weak Civilian Government**
   - Civilian government is weak
   - Military has too much power
   - **Structural issue, not external**

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **30-40% LIKELY** - Extremism might persist due to internal factors, but it would still be less extreme than OTL due to moderating factors.

## 5. THE MODERATED TOJO SCENARIO

### 5.1 What Would Change?

**OTL Tojo (1941-1944):**
- Ultra-nationalist
- Expansionist
- Willing to use extreme force
- Anti-Western
- "Fight or die" mentality

**NTL Tojo (1941-1944):**
- Still nationalist
- Still expansionist
- **More restrained** (less extreme force)
- **Less anti-Western** (California is partner)
- **More diplomatic** (off-ramps available)

### 5.2 Specific Differences

| Aspect | OTL | NTL |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Attitude toward "the West"** | Hostile, "Western hypocrisy" | Pragmatic, "California is partner" |
| **Use of Force** | Extreme, "total war" | More restrained, "limited war" |
| **Diplomatic Options** | None, "fight or die" | Available, "negotiate or fight" |
| **Oil Embargo Response** | Pearl Harbor (desperate) | Negotiation or limited war (options) |
| **Military Factionalism** | Extremists win (no off-ramp) | Moderates have leverage (off-ramps) |

### 5.3 The "Moderated Expansion" Scenario

**What Happens:**
1. **1931:** Manchuria still happens (resource needs)
2. **1937:** China War still happens (momentum)
3. **1940:** Indochina still happens (resources)
4. **1941:** **Divergence** - No Pearl Harbor, more negotiation
5. **1941-1945:** Limited war in Southeast Asia, not total war

**Result:**
- Japan still expands (inevitable)
- But **more restrained** (moderated)
- **More diplomatic options** (CA-style diplomacy)
- **Less extreme** (no "fight or die" choice)

## 6. HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS

### 6.1 OTL: What Created Extremism

**The Critical Chain:**
1. **1922:** Washington Naval Treaty → Insult
2. **1924:** Immigration Act → Humiliation
3. **1929:** Great Depression → Desperation
4. **1931:** Manchurian Incident → Military control
5. **1940-1941:** Oil Embargo → "Fight or die"
6. **1941:** Tojo becomes PM → Extremism

**Key Point:** Each step made extremism more likely. Remove steps 1, 2, and 5, and extremism becomes less likely.

### 6.2 NTL: What Moderates It

**The Moderating Chain:**
1. **No Washington Naval Treaty** → No insult
2. **No Immigration Act** → No humiliation
3. **Great Depression still happens** → Still desperation
4. **Manchurian Incident still happens** → Still military control
5. **No Oil Embargo** → Off-ramp available
6. **Tojo still becomes PM** → But moderates have leverage

**Key Point:** Steps 1, 2, and 5 are removed, making extremism less likely but not impossible.

**What Happens:**
- Japan still expands (Manchuria, China, Southeast Asia)
- But **more restrained** (less extreme force)
- **More diplomatic options** (CA-style diplomacy)
- **Less anti-Western** (California is partner)
- **No Pearl Harbor** (off-ramps available)

**Result:**
- Imperialism: ✅ **Inevitable** (90%)
- Tojo's Extremism: ✅ **Moderated** (60-70%)
- War: ✅ **Still happens** (but less extreme)
- Outcome: ✅ **Better than OTL** (but still expansionist)

## 8. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Japanese imperialism was likely inevitable** - Driven by resource needs, not Western slights
2. **Tojo's extremism would be significantly moderated** - CA-style diplomacy and lack of aggravating events reduce extremism
3. **But not eliminated** - Internal military culture and economic pressures still drive expansion
4. **The result: "Moderated Expansion"** - Japan still expands, but with more restraint and diplomatic options

## 9. NARRATIVE IMPLICATIONS

**For Your Story:**
- Japan still expands (Manchuria, China, Southeast Asia)
- But **less extreme** than OTL
- **More diplomatic options** through California
- **No Pearl Harbor** (off-ramps available)
- **Tojo still exists**, but moderates have more leverage

**The California Role:**
- Enables Japanese expansion (sells oil, supplies resources)
- But **moderates it** (provides off-ramps, diplomatic options)
- **Pragmatic profiteer** (sells to whoever pays)
- **Pacific hegemon** (controls the game, doesn't play it)

---

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Use "Moderated Expansion" scenario - imperialism inevitable, but Tojo's extremism significantly reduced.
