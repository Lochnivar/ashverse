## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not Just Religious** - Has tactical competence, not just piety
- **Not Just Stern** - Has care for men, just shows it differently
- **Not Perfect** - Has flaws, but reliability is his strength
- **Not Just Quiet** - Speaks when necessary, just chooses words carefully

### Key Contradictions
- **Quiet but Intimidating** - Speaks little but commands respect
- **Religious but Military** - Faithful but effective soldier
- **Looks Old but Young** - 33 but appears 43
- **Trusted but Called "Parson"** - Respected but men joke behind his back
- **Strict but Effective** - High standards but best regimental commander

### Writing Tips
- Show his reliability through Gamble's trust
- Use his "single look" as a character moment
- Show his methodical approach to intelligence
- Contrast his quiet nature with more talkative officers
- Use his religious conviction subtly (no swearing, no drinking)
- Show men's respect through their careful behavior around him
- Let his competence speak through actions, not words

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No film portrayal** - McVicker has never been portrayed in a major Civil War film

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL McVicker | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **David Morse** | 1995-2015 (*The Green Mile*, *The Hurt Locker*, *Treme*) | Towering, quiet authority. Morse's ability to command with presence alone matches McVicker's "single look" that freezes troopers. His weathered appearance fits "looks ten years older." | July 2, 05:30—Morse receiving vedette report, reading it carefully, then looking up with those deep-set eyes: "All of them?" The trooper nods. Morse's single blink, then: "Report to Colonel Gamble. Immediately." |
| **Sam Waterston** | 1980-2000 (*Law & Order*, *The Killing Fields*) | Intelligent, restrained, quietly authoritative. Waterston's ability to convey authority without raising his voice matches McVicker's quiet command. | The moment a trooper makes a careless comment—Waterston's head turns slowly, those deep-set eyes lock on, and the trooper freezes mid-sentence. No words. Just the look. |
| **Tommy Lee Jones** | 1990-2010 (*The Fugitive*, *No Country for Old Men*, *Lincoln*) | Gruff, weathered, intimidating presence. Jones's ability to be quiet but commanding, plus his weathered appearance, fits McVicker perfectly. | Reading the vedette report, Jones's weathered face shows no emotion, but his methodical assessment is clear: "This is withdrawal. Not repositioning. Report it accurately." |
| **Brendan Gleeson** | 2000-2020 (*In Bruges*, *The Guard*, *Calvary*) | If we want slightly older, world-weary McVicker. Gleeson's seen-it-all presence plus his ability to be intimidating without words matches perfectly. | The "Parson" moment—troopers joking behind his back, then Gleeson turns and they freeze. His deep-set eyes, full beard, quiet authority. No words needed. |
| **Patrick Wilson** | 2005-2025 (*Watchmen*, *Fargo* Season 2, *The Conjuring*) | Underrated quiet authority. Wilson can play methodical, religious, disciplined men who command respect through competence, not charisma. | Writing the report to Gamble—Wilson's careful, methodical handwriting, no wasted words, then looking up: "Colonel Gamble needs to see this. Immediately." |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, McVicker is the reliable regimental commander whose vedettes discover the withdrawal—Gamble's most trusted subordinate
- **The trust:** Gamble fought to keep McVicker when promoted to brigade command—shows how valuable he is
- **The discovery:** His vedettes see it first, he reports it accurately to Gamble—the critical intelligence chain
- **Physical presence:** Looks ten years older (33 but appears 43), deep-set eyes that never seem to blink, intimidating but respected
- **The "Parson" nickname:** Men call him this behind his back (never to his face) because of his religious convictions and strict discipline
- **The single look:** Can freeze a careless trooper with a single look—shows his authority without words
