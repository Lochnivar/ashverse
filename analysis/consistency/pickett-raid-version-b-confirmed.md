## NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT

**The 2-Day Gap Explained:**
> "Hancock was wounded on July 12 while actively pursuing Pickett's raiding force. With the Union commander down, Pickett used the next two days to safely withdraw his 14,000 men across the Potomac and back into Confederate territory. The raid officially ended on July 14 when the last Confederate soldier crossed the border, but the damage was done. Northern newspapers had already screamed 'FORTY DAYS OF TERROR!' and the peace movement had found its rallying cry."

**This narrative:**
- ✅ Explains the 2-day gap cleanly
- ✅ Maintains military realism
- ✅ Keeps dramatic timing (Hancock wounded during active raid)
- ✅ Provides clean closure (withdrawal period)

---

**Version B (June 14 - July 14) is CONFIRMED as canonical.**

- 30 days actual raiding
- Hancock wounded July 12 (during active raid)
- 2-day withdrawal period (July 12-14) is narratively clean and militarily realistic
- No changes needed to current master timeline
- Plausibility: 95%
