# Roaring Twenties NTL: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Roaring Twenties economic boom in NTL (1920-1929)

---

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Roaring Twenties economic boom occurs in NTL, but differs from OTL due to three-nation structure

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Each nation experiences boom differently
- Timing and severity vary by nation
- Drivers differ by nation's economic structure
- Trade barriers affect synchronization

---

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Timeframe: 1920-1929 (OTL boom period)
- Nations: USA, CSA, California (three separate economies)
- OTL drivers: Post-WWI boom, stock speculation, consumer credit, industrial production, real estate, prohibition, Fed policy
- NTL differences: Three-nation structure, different WWI participation, different economic structures

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Unified economy, massive boom 1920-1929
- NTL: Three separate economies, different structures
- Precedent: OTL economic boom patterns

**Constraints:**
- Must account for three-nation structure
- Must maintain historical plausibility
- Must serve narrative function
- Must align with established economic systems

---

## RESULTS

**Overall Plausibility Score: 80%** (Strong)

**Key Findings:**

**USA: "The Flickering Twenties" (1921-1928)**
- Regional mini-booms in major cities
- Factories scale up during WWI (1917-1919) but sit half-idle when orders stop
- Less unified boom than OTL
- **Plausibility: 82%** - Realistic given three-nation structure

**CSA: Moderate Boom (1923-1930)**
- Agricultural recovery
- Trade boom with USA enabled by tariff normalization (1905-1920)
- Less dramatic than OTL
- **Plausibility: 85%** - Agricultural recovery realistic

**California: Continuous Growth (1919-1929)**
- Oil revenue drives growth
- Trade expansion
- Less dramatic "roaring" character
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Oil revenue buffer realistic

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 85% (OTL boom patterns applicable)
- Economic Realism: 80% (Three-nation structure creates differences)
- Narrative Function: 75% (Serves story but less dramatic)
- Timing Plausibility: 80% (Different timing realistic)

**Key Differences from OTL:**
- ✅ Less unified boom (three separate economies)
- ✅ Different timing (USA 1921-1928, CSA 1923-1930, California 1919-1929)
- ✅ Different drivers (USA industrial, CSA agricultural, California oil)
- ✅ Less speculative bubble (no unified stock market)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Three-nation structure creates different boom patterns - **Justification:** Realistic given separate economies
- Trade normalization enables CSA boom - **Justification:** Aligns with established timeline
- Oil revenue buffers California - **Justification:** Realistic given oil reserves

**Limitations:**
- Less dramatic than OTL boom
- Requires accepting different timing
- Economic interactions between nations need careful justification

**Edge Cases:**
- What if boom is more unified? → **Not tested:** Assumes three-nation differences
- What if boom doesn't happen? → **Not tested:** Assumes boom occurs

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 80%** (Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Realistic given three-nation structure. Different timing and drivers plausible. Less dramatic than OTL but serves narrative function.
