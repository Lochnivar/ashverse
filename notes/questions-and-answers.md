## THE MATCH (1863-1865)

### The War After Gettysburg

**Q1:** How exactly does the war continue after Longstreet's withdrawal? Is it:
- [ ] Continued raids and skirmishes?
- [ ] Full-scale battles?
- [ ] Siege warfare?
- [ ] Something else?

**A1:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/core-premise.md`**

The war continues because Longstreet's withdrawal preserves the ANV at ~55,000-58,000 strength (vs. OTL's ~45,000 after Gettysburg). This maintains Confederate military viability and breaks Northern morale. The key difference: ANV casualties are ~12,000-15,000 (vs. OTL's ~30,000), preserving the army's fighting strength. Northern morale shifts from "We can win this!" to "They're still here… and we can't stop them." This leads to McClellan being elected on a peace platform in 1864, rather than Lincoln's re-election.

**Q2:** What specific military events happen between July 1863 and March 1865 that lead to the Union losing the will to continue? The timeline mentions:
- Pickett's Raid (June 1864, 18k troops, 21 days, Chesapeake terror, threatens Washington)
- Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (July 1864)
- But what else breaks Northern resolve?

**A2:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/northern-collapse-1863-1865.md`**

The exact locked sequence:
- **Jul–Oct 1863:** Longstreet's 10-week Pennsylvania–Maryland raid (burns railroads, levies $3–5 million, gets within sight of Baltimore)
- **Late Oct 1863:** Battle of Hagerstown ("Meade's Last Throw") – Meade repulsed, loses 9k men for nothing
- **Nov 1863:** Lincoln sacks Meade
- **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri
- **June 8–28, 1864:** Pickett's Raid (18k men, 21 days, threatens Washington for 48 hours)
- **12 July 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead)
- **Aug–Dec 1864:** Winter of Despair (food riots, draft resistance collapses, Copperhead victories)
- **Nov 1864:** McClellan elected on peace platform
- **Jan–Mar 1865:** Desertion epidemic, both armies disintegrating

**The cumulative kill-shot:** No second Gettysburg victory, two summers of Confederate boots on Northern soil, capital threatened, last hero falls, bread riots + peace election = moral collapse.
