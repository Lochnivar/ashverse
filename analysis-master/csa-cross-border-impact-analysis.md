**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** CSA cross-border impact on USA presidential timeline (1929-1935)

---

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** CSA political dynamics and cross-border events affect USA presidential timeline

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Trade collapse creates cross-border effects
- Hayseed resurgence affects USA politics
- Border tensions escalate during crisis
- Migration crisis creates political pressure

---

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Timeframe: 1929-1935 (crisis period)
- CSA trigger: Trade collapse (one of three separate crisis triggers)
- CSA political context: Hayseed resurgence (1925-1939)
- USA political context: Depression era (1929-1933)
- Cross-border effects: Trade war, migration, border tensions

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: No CSA, different crisis dynamics
- NTL: Three separate nations, different crisis triggers
- Precedent: OTL cross-border economic effects

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain historical realism
- Must account for three-nation structure
- Must serve narrative function
- Must align with established timeline

---

## RESULTS

**Overall Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)

**Key Findings:**

**Trade War Escalation (1929-1932):**
- ✅ CSA trade collapse → Hayseed blames USA tariffs
- ✅ Hayseed resurgence → More protectionist rhetoric
- ✅ USA crisis → Protectionist response
- ✅ Result: Trade war escalates, worsens both crises
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Trade war realistic, adds to blame narrative

**Border Tensions / Migration Crisis (1930-1933):**
- ✅ CSA trade collapse → Economic refugees flee to USA
- ✅ Hayseed blames USA → Anti-USA sentiment rises
- ✅ Border tensions escalate (economic, not military)
- ✅ Result: Migration crisis, border disputes, diplomatic tensions
- **Plausibility: 87%** - Migration crisis realistic

**Impact on USA Presidential Timeline:**
- ✅ Hoover gets blamed for trade war escalation
- ✅ Narrative: "Hoover didn't prevent it" + "Hoover started trade war"
- ✅ 1932 Election: More dramatic (trade war makes crisis worse)
- ✅ Plausibility increases: 88% (instead of 86%) - trade war adds to blame
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Impact on timeline realistic

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 87% (OTL cross-border effects applicable)
- Economic Realism: 88% (Trade war escalation realistic)
- Political Realism: 88% (Hayseed resurgence affects USA)
- Narrative Function: 88% (Serves story purpose)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Trade collapse creates cross-border effects - **Justification:** Realistic economic dynamics
- Hayseed resurgence affects USA politics - **Justification:** Political spillover realistic
- Migration crisis creates pressure - **Justification:** Economic refugees realistic

**Limitations:**
- Some details require careful justification
- Timing requires coordination between nations
- Border tensions need careful handling

**Edge Cases:**
- What if trade war doesn't escalate? → **Handled:** Some scenarios show cooperation
- What if migration crisis doesn't occur? → **Not tested:** Assumes economic refugees

---

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 88%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Strong historical precedents, economic realism excellent, political realism good. Cross-border effects serve narrative function and align with established timeline.
