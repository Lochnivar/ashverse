## Casting Reference

### Primary Choice
**Jon Hamm**
- **Peak Era:** 2007-2025 (Mad Men, Top Gun: Maverick)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The modern golden boy. Hamm's Don Draper charm married to Maverick swagger is McClellan reborn — the man every soldier wants to follow and every civilian wants to believe in, right until the moment he sells them out.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The victory speech after the election — Hamm on the balcony, voice ringing with triumph, while his eyes already know what comes next.

### Alternative Choices

**Stephen Lang**
- **Peak Era:** 1993-2015 (Gettysburg, Avatar)
- **Why He's Perfect:** He already played him. Let him come back thirty years later with the hollow victory smile. Lang's Pickett in Gettysburg proved he can play a man who believes his own myth right up to the moment it kills him.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The Treaty signing — Lang pausing with the pen, looking at Stanton's broken face, and saying softly, "This is what the people chose" before he signs.

**Michael Fassbender**
- **Peak Era:** 2010-2020 (Shame, Steve Jobs, The Counselor)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The premium dark-horse choice. Fassbender can play ambition that eats its host from the inside. His Steve Jobs victory speech energy would make McClellan's peace platform feel like a slow-motion suicide.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The moment he quietly orders federal troops not to stop the Last Hurrah raids — Fassbender's face showing the exact second he realizes he's become the thing he once accused Lincoln of being.

**Matthew Rhys**
- **Peak Era:** 2010-2025 (The Americans, Perry Mason)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The understated winner. Rhys's Philip Jennings restraint would make McClellan's caution feel like cowardice wearing a hero's uniform.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The final cabinet meeting — Rhys delivering "I will not let this nation bleed any longer" with perfect sincerity while everyone in the room hears the surrender underneath.

**Oscar Isaac**
- **Peak Era:** 2015-2025 (Inside Llewyn Davis, A Most Violent Year)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The poetic destroyer. Isaac can play a man whose charisma is the weapon that finally kills the thing he loves most.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The March 31 signing — Isaac looking up from the document, smiling the smile of a man who just won the war and lost his soul in the same stroke.
