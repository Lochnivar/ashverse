## Book Blurb
September 1939. Europe burns again. And the continent watches.

Seventy-six years after Robert E. Lee died at Gettysburg, the Fairfax and Meade bloodlines have watched history unfold. They've seen the birth, survival, and self-destruction of an independent Confederacy. They've witnessed the rise of sovereign Native super-states. They've observed California's quiet secession and the decades of raids, boycotts, and realpolitik that finally killed slavery in 1905.

Now, as Europe burns, they must confront the consequences of all the choices made over those decades. The ashes of the old conflicts still smolder. New fires are being lit. And the continent must decide: will it be consumed by the flames, or will it find a way to live with the ashes?

This is not a story about who was right in 1861. It is a story about what happens when everyone is wrong, and the continent still has to live with the ashes.

## Core Plot
The 1930s bring the Great Depression and rising tensions in Europe. The North American continent, having developed its own complex relationships over seven decades, watches as Europe moves toward war. The Fairfax and Meade bloodlines, with their immortal perspectives, see the patterns repeating. They understand that the choices made in 1863 and the decades that followed have led to this moment.

As September 1939 arrives and Europe goes to war, the continent must confront its own history. The ashes of old conflicts still smolder. The independent nations of North America must decide how to respond, what to learn, and how to move forward. The immortal bloodlines provide perspective, but ultimately, it is the mortal generations who must live with the consequences.
