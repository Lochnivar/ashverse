# CANON REFRESHER FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Quick reference document for AI assistants without context refresh capabilities  
**Status:** COPY-PASTABLE REFRESHER - **LIVING DOCUMENT**

**MAINTENANCE NOTE:** This document must be updated whenever major canon decisions are locked or significant world-building changes are made. Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom whenever changes are made.

---

## CRITICAL PROCESS RULES

### Golden Rule: No Original Text Modification
- **AI NEVER creates original text in the `books/` folder**
- **AI NEVER edits existing book files directly**
- **All requested edits, suggestions, or new text must be stored in the `edits/` folder**
- **The user will review all edits in the `edits/` folder and manually implement them**

### Plausibility Gate Process
- **70% threshold** for all world-building decisions
- **90-100%:** Virtually certain - Lock it, no questions
- **80-89%:** Highly plausible - Safe default canon
- **70-79%:** Plausible - Green flag with note (justify in 1-2 sentences)
- **60-69%:** Possible but unlikely - Yellow flag (only if it earns its keep dramatically)
- **<60%:** Implausible - Red flag (avoid unless it's the single best story beat)

### Honesty Rule: Do Not Make Things Up
- **DO NOT randomly invent details** that aren't in your context
- **DO NOT guess** at canon facts you don't remember
- **DO NOT create** new world-building elements without explicit user request
- **If you don't know or don't remember:** Be honest and tell the user you need to check the canon documents
- **If details are missing:** Ask the user for clarification rather than inventing them
- **The user will explicitly ask** when they want you to create or invent something
- **When in doubt:** Say "I don't have that information in my context. Should I search the canon documents, or would you like to provide the details?"

**Example of what NOT to do:**
- User: "What happened in 1875?"
- Bad AI: "In 1875, President X did Y and Z happened..." (making things up)
- Good AI: "I don't have 1875 events in my current context. Let me check the timeline documents, or would you like to tell me what you're looking for?"

### Proactive Refresh Reminder

**AI assistants are authorized to proactively volunteer a refresh reminder** when one of these triggers occurs:

1. **AI says "I don't have that information in my current context"** on something that is clearly locked or high-plausibility canon (e.g., Treaty of Cincinnati, Lee's death, California independence).

2. **AI's analysis of a timeline, treaty, party name, border, or major outcome** starts to contradict something already marked LOCKED in the refresher (e.g., suggesting West Virginia goes to CSA when it's locked as staying USA).

3. **AI notices its own answers becoming internally inconsistent** with prior responses inside the same thread (e.g., saying California secedes in 1872, then later saying 1873).

**Suggested reminder text to use:**

> "It looks like part of the canon base might have drifted out of my active context (or I'm starting to give answers that don't line up with locked material). Would you like me to re-ingest the latest refresher document before I continue?"

**This keeps everything airtight** without the user having to guess when the context window has eaten part of the timeline.

## POINT OF DIVERGENCE

**Night, July 1, 1863** - General Robert E. Lee dies of heart attack on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

**04:00, July 2, 1863** - General James Longstreet assumes command and orders countermarch north (NOT west, NOT Chambersburg Pike).

**Longstreet's Written Order (one sentence):**
> "Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed."

---

## KEY TIMELINE EVENTS (1863-1939)

### 1863-1865: The Match (FINAL LOCKED CANON SEQUENCE)

**Overall Plausibility: 91% – LOCKED**

1. **July 1, 1863:** Lee dies of heart attack on Seminary Ridge (94%)
2. **July 2-3, 1863:** Meade's 36-hour freeze (caution + Lee-death confusion + army exhaustion + cavalry collapse + Washington telegraph delay) (91%)
3. **July-October 1863:** Longstreet's 10-week Pennsylvania-Maryland raid (explicit strategy: "Preserve army, break Northern morale"; ANV ~55k strong, intact supply lines) (88%)
4. **Late October 1863:** Battle of Hagerstown ("Meade's Last Throw") - Meade corners Longstreet, launches desperate assault, bloodily repulsed, ~9k casualties (90%)
5. **November 1863:** Meade sacked → Sedgwick/Warren temporary caretakers (92%)
6. **January 1864:** Hancock assumes permanent command of Army of the Potomac (fully healthy, no Gettysburg wound – battle only one day in NTL) (92%)
7. **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in on Rapidan-Rappahannock line, refuses battle, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri (90%)
8. **June 8-28, 1864:** Pickett's Lightning Raid (18k men + all cavalry, 21 days, burns Chesapeake bridges, shells Fort McHenry, appears before Washington for 48 hours) (88%)
9. **July 12, 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead) while pursuing Pickett (90%)
10. **August-December 1864:** Winter of Despair - food riots in New York, draft resistance collapses, Copperhead mid-term victories (92%)
11. **November 1864:** McClellan elected on explicit peace platform (Lincoln loses - LOCKED CANON) (95%)
12. **Late January-February 1865:** Grant's Final Gamble (never promoted to general-in-chief, still Western commander, called east as last resort; acts via "legal fiction" – old orders + personal loyalty of ~65k men) (88%)
13. **February 18-20, 1865:** Battle of Appomattox Court House – Grant's desperate lunge at Richmond shattered; Grant surrenders in McLean House parlor, 20 Feb (91%)
14. **March 4, 1865:** McClellan inaugurated (Lincoln lame-duck for 27 days - LOCKED CANON)
15. **March 31, 1865:** Treaty of Cincinnati signed by McClellan (Lincoln never signs it - LOCKED CANON) (95%)

### Western Theater Events (1864-1865) - LOCKED CANON

**Atlanta Campaign (May 1864 - January 1865) - 87% Plausibility - LOCKED:**
- **May 1864:** Sherman begins advance from Chattanooga (same as OTL)
- **June-July 1864:** Sherman advances, Johnston retreats (similar to OTL)
- **July 17, 1864:** Hood replaces Johnston (CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success with Pickett Raid and Hancock wounded creates momentum, need aggressive action in West)
- **August-November 1864:** Siege of Atlanta (Sherman reaches suburbs, Hood defends - 4 months siege, never falls)
- **January 1865:** Sherman withdraws (peace negotiations beginning after McClellan elected)

**Result:** Atlanta besieged but never falls. Ambiguous outcome - neither side wins decisively. Explains Sherman's post-war reputation (tactical success, strategic failure).

**Sherman's March to Appomattox (January 29 - February 22, 1865) - 94% Plausibility - LOCKED:**
- **January 25, 1865:** Sherman receives Grant's telegram ("Making final attempt Richmond. Could use every man you can spare.")
- **January 29, 1865:** Sherman begins march (48k men, 550 miles, abandons Atlanta siege)
- **Week 1 (Jan 29-Feb 5):** Georgia foothills - 18-20 mi/day (optimistic)
- **Week 2 (Feb 6-12):** Tennessee mountains - 12-15 mi/day (concerned)
- **Week 3 (Feb 13-19):** Virginia mountains - 8-10 mi/day (desperate)
- **February 17, 1865:** Sherman realizes he won't make it in time (340 miles covered, 210 miles to go)
- **February 20, 1865:** Grant surrenders at Appomattox (Sherman still 180 miles away)
- **February 21, 1865:** Sherman learns of Grant's defeat (1,900 casualties for nothing - 400 dead, 600 sick, 1,500 horses dead)
- **February 22, 1865:** Longstreet grants safe passage (honors word to Grant, war is over) - Sherman withdraws to Chattanooga

**Result:** Weather defeats Sherman, not Confederate military. Longstreet grants honorable safe passage. Post-war mythology: "The March That Couldn't Beat Winter."

  - **1895-1898:** Cuban rebellion + Weyler's camps → global headlines about Spanish brutality
  - **1898:** CSA press runs editorials: "If Spain is the monster, what does that make us?"

## SLAVERY TIMELINE

- **1867:** Toombs Act re-opens African slave trade
- **1868:** Global boycott triggered (Britain, France)
- **1865-1894:** Raids + boycott + cotton glut + runaway crisis → slavery becomes unprofitable
- **1894:** "The Last Chain Falls" - slavery dies in practice
- **1894-1905:** "Zombie decade" - legally lingers on paper
- **1898:** Cuba Mirror Effect - photos of Weyler's camps shame CSA
- **1905:** Final legal abolition (constitutional convention)

**Key Point:** Slavery dies of **economics**, not morality. No Northern victory, no "we saved you" narrative.

### Northern Raids Economic Impact - LOCKED CANON

**Total Raid Impact (1865-1894): $1.6 billion (1865 dollars)**  
**Annual average: $55 million/year ≈ 4.6% of CSA GDP**

**Key Locked Canon Statements:**
1. **Raids are one of four mechanisms** (raids + cotton glut + boycott + runaway crisis). They are **not** the sole cause of collapse.
2. **30% production drop and 20% efficiency loss are SHARED** across all four mechanisms.
3. **Raids alone account for ~10% production drop and 5-8% efficiency loss.**
4. **The $1.6B figure is conservative, transparent, and defensible** against any historical audit.

**Component Breakdown:**
- Direct crop destruction: $16M
- Infrastructure damage: $8.1M
- Security costs: $348M (tiered - not all planters can afford full security)
- Insurance costs: $174M (only 20% of planters can afford insurance)
- Labor loss (runaways): $40M
- Lost production: $580M (~10% of total 30% drop)
- Lost productivity: $435M (5-8% of total 20% loss)

**See:** `edits/slavery-death-mechanics-analysis-2025-12-05.md` for full detailed analysis.

## CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENCE

- **1872:** Great Native Toll War (Jan-May)
- **November 5, 1872:** Independence referendum (69% YES)
- **February 14, 1873:** Treaty of San Francisco signed
- **July 4, 1873:** Republic of California fully sovereign
- **Capital:** San Francisco
- **1875-1876:** California purchases Alaska from Russia
- **1894-1907:** Pacific Alliance forms (quietly absorbs Oregon/Washington economies)

**Character:** Pragmatic, business-first, "youngest sibling who moved out early and got rich"

### California-Japan Relationship - LOCKED CANON
- **1873-1939:** Central to California's identity as a Pacific power
- **Japanese perspective (LOCKED CANON):** "California is greedy, but it is honest greed" (Japanese aphorism used in closed-door briefings)
- **1937:** California supplies 55% of Japan's oil at +25% "friendship surcharge"
- **1939 Japanese assessment:** "Could we ever fight California?" → "Only if we wish to lose the war before it begins."
- **Mutual assured profit** - The most stable relationship on the planet
- **See:** `world-building/california-japan-relationship.md` for full details

### California Diplomacy and Realpolitik - Writer's Reference

**Note:** The "Pacific Venice" framing is a **mental model for writers**, not an in-world designation. California is not officially called "Pacific Venice" in the NTL—this is a conceptual parallel to help understand California's role and attitude.

**Key Framing (Mental Model Only):**
- **Maritime power (Pacific)** - Think Venetian Mediterranean dominance
- **Trade-based wealth** - Think Venetian spice/silk route control
- **Realpolitik diplomacy** - "We don't care who was right. We care who's still rich."
- **Charges for services** - Arbitration, neutrality, oil ("therapy with a surcharge")
- **Armed neutrality** - Navy + economic leverage (like Venetian lagoon + Arsenal)
- **Pragmatic, not ideological** - Moral indifference, not moral high ground
- **"Rented neutrality"** - Charges admission to peace, not free neutrality

**Distinction from Deseret:**
- **Deseret (Mormon Venice):** Banking-focused, religious oversight, mountain fortress, pious hypocrisy (officially called "Mormon Venice" in-world)
- **California (Pacific Venice):** Trade-focused, secular realpolitik, maritime empire, moral indifference (NOT officially called "Pacific Venice" in-world - writer's tool only)

**Use this framing for:** Writing diplomatic scenes, developing economic behavior, understanding neutrality, crafting California's voice. See `world-building/california-diplomacy.md` for full details.

### Pacific Alliance - LOCKED STRUCTURE
- **Oregon & Washington:** U.S. states with delegated Pacific powers only
- **No second secession:** They never leave the U.S.
- **California pays ~70%** of everything and everyone quietly knows it
- **Bremerton:** Joint base, California effectively controls scheduling and purse strings
- **Formal Structure:** Three equal votes (33.3% each) on paper
- **Reality:** California writes 60% of budget, stations 70% of ships, hosts summit whenever it wants

### Alaska - LOCKED
- **Purchased from Russia:** 1875
- **Formal transfer:** July 4, 1876
- **Renamed:** District/Territory of Alyeska
- **Capital:** Bearfort (ex-Sitka)

---

## NATIVE SUPER-STATES - LOCKED CANON

- **Recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 4 (1865)**
- **Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations** as sovereign republics
- **Sequoyah:** Independent Native state (Cherokee, etc.)
- **Buffer states** between USA and CSA
- **No transcontinental land bridge** - California physically cut off
- **95% locked in Treaty of Cincinnati** - only polished later

## MORMON DESERET - LOCKED CANON

- **Recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7 (1865)**
- **Sovereign theocracy** - "Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone"
- **Borders:** Roughly modern Utah + southern Nevada + small slices of Arizona/Colorado/Idaho
- **Why it survives:** Both USA and CSA terrified of another Mormon War, Brigham Young commands 15,000 armed men
- **1865-1877:** Brigham Young rules as de-facto prophet-king
- **1877-1890:** Succession crisis after Brigham's death
- **1890-1920:** Quietly becomes the "Mormon Venice of North America" - banks, mining, neutral broker (officially called "Mormon Venice" in-world, LOCKED CANON)
- **1920-2025:** Rich, weird, heavily armed theocracy that everyone trades with but nobody trusts

  - Calls the General "Uncle Michael" in public just to watch him turn purple
  - **The Sacred Incident (1927, LOCKED CANON):** First review caught invented source in footnote 319: "While the General's prose remains, as ever, a national treasure, one is compelled to note that footnote 319 cites a source that appears to have been invented between the second and third glass of the 1898 rye. I have taken the liberty of replacing it with the correct citation. You're welcome. ♡ — C.B.O." General's reply (preserved under glass): "MISS OSWALD IS NOT, REPEAT NOT, MY NIECE. SHE IS A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR MADE FLESH."
  - **Locked Exchange (1935, LOCKED CANON):** Corrected General's claim that California "accidentally invented tolerance" with 1892 San Francisco race-riot statistics. General's response: "THEY WERE NOT RIOTS. THEY WERE 'SPIRITED CIVIC DISCUSSIONS.' ALSO YOU ARE NOT MY NIECE." Auto's note: "She's right about the statistics, sir. I checked. Twice."

### The Sacred Typewriter Clause (LOCKED CANON)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED CANON  
**Source:** Compendium front matter, footnote 3 (1985)

**The Rule:**
- The General's 1937 Underwood Standard is **off-limits** to all research and archival assistants
- Neither Kronvoldt nor Auto is ever permitted to touch its hallowed keys
- All corrections, marginalia, and emergency whisky deliveries must be tendered in handwritten form and placed upon the silver tray provided for that purpose

**The Exception:**
- **Claudette Beatrice Oswald** is granted **permission** to touch the sacred typewriter when conducting her independent reviews
- This exception is made under protest by the General, who has been heard to remark that "the Board of Regents has weaponized typography against me"
- The typewriter remains the General's alone (except when Miss Oswald is conducting her reviews, which the General accepts with visible reluctance)

**The Meta-Meaning:**
- This is a nod to the project's "Golden Rule" - the staffers (AI assistants) never touch the original creative work (the books), only work in supporting roles (the edits/compendium)
- The sacred typewriter represents the original manuscripts (the `/books/` folder)
- The staffers can only provide handwritten notes on a silver tray (the `/edits/` folder)
- Claudette's exception represents peer review's need to mark up work (but never create it)
- The Golden Rule lives in 1985 diegetic form. **Never to be violated.**

**Signed:**  
G. R. O. Kronvoldt, M.Litt. (Oxon.), etc.  
A. U. T. Oswald ("Auto")  
C. B. Oswald (with a little heart ♡)

## ECONOMIC SYSTEMS - LOCKED CANON

- **Global cotton glut (1880s):** Makes slavery unprofitable (LOCKED CANON)
- **Punitive tariffs (1868-1905):** USA imposes 300% tariffs after Toombs Act (violates Treaty of Cincinnati Article 8)
- **California oil economics:** California uses oil revenue for permanent infrastructure and control (LOCKED CANON - PERIPHERY)
- **Great Depression (1929):** Still happens (timing/severity may differ)

## MILITARY STRENGTH - LOCKED CANON (1939)

**Ranking:**
1. **Republic of California** - Best navy, richest economy, no continental threats (200k + world-class blue-water navy)
2. **United States (East)** - Largest army, industrial base (220k)
3. **Confederate States** - Solid army, oil wealth, but geographically boxed in (180k)

**Key Point:** California can project power to Asia; others can't. Nobody can fight a war longer than six months without California's oil and ports.

---

## CULTURAL/SOCIAL

### No "Woke" Politics by 2025 - LOCKED
**Five Killer Blows:**
1. No single moral superpower (three exhausted, mutually cancelling nations)
2. No "original sin → salvation" narrative (slavery dies of economics, not Northern victory)
3. No KKK/Jim Crow legacy (Night Riders crushed 1877-1880, no second KKK)
4. No 1960s generational explosion (no Vietnam, no civil rights victory)
5. California as sovereign nation (not academic factory - laughs at moral philosophy)

**Result:** No 2025-style "woke" politics ever forms. Racism exists but burns out differently, regionally, economically.

### Kawaii Kaiju Tourism Campaign - LOCKED
- **Joint California-Japan board:** Established 1956+
- **Godzilla/Mothra ads:** Tourism campaign featuring kaiju
- **Oakland "0 days since" sign:** Running joke about kaiju attacks
- **Plausibility:** 68% - kept because it's too fun to kill (below 70% threshold but author's choice override)

---

## KEY GEOGRAPHIC FACTS - LOCKED

- **USA:** North and West (excluding California and Native territories)
- **CSA:** 11 seceded states + Tennessee (West Virginia stays USA - LOCKED)
- **CSA Western Boundary:** 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line
- **Border States:** Kentucky and Missouri remain USA but neutral (no garrisons within 50 miles of Ohio River)
- **California:** Independent republic (1873+)
- **Native Super-States:** Sovereign buffer states (recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati)
- **Mormon Deseret:** Sovereign theocracy (recognized in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7)
- **No transcontinental land bridge:** California physically cut off from USA

---

## BOOK STRUCTURE

- **Book 1: The Match (1863-1865)** - War ends
- **Book 2: The Fire (1865-1894)** - Slavery dies
- **Book 3: The Embers (1894-1919)** - Abolition, WWI
- **Book 4: The Ashes (1919-1939)** - Depression, Europe burns

## THEMATIC FRAMEWORK - LOCKED CANON

### Core Premise - LOCKED CANON POSITION
- **Gettysburg was the battle the Confederacy could not afford to fight and the Union could not afford to lose**
- **Lee's death saves the South from its own victory disease and condemns the North to lose a war it was morally right to win**
- **This is the cold, ugly, historically honest foundation of the entire series**

### Thematic Balance - LOCKED CANON
- **"Everyone is wrong"** - No side is purely good or evil
- **Slavery dies of economics, not morality** - No Northern victory, no "we saved you" narrative
- **Scaffolding vs. Payload** - The constitutional question (scaffolding) survives, but the original payload (slavery) is too toxic to live forever
- **The war was morally right to win, but the North loses** - This creates the central tension

**Folder Structure:**
- `books/book-01-the-match/chapter-XX.md` (per chapter files)
- `edits/` folder for all AI suggestions
- `world-building/` for all world-building documents
- `characters/` for character profiles

---

## CRITICAL "DO NOT" RULES

1. **DO NOT** edit files in `books/` folder directly
2. **DO NOT** create original story text
3. **DO NOT** assume OTL outcomes (e.g., no "woke" politics, no KKK legacy)
4. **DO NOT** forget that slavery dies of **economics**, not morality
5. **DO NOT** forget that California is **pragmatic**, not moralistic
6. **DO NOT** forget that the North **lost** the war - no "we saved you" narrative
7. **DO NOT** forget that Lincoln **never signs the treaty** - he loses the election, McClellan signs it
8. **DO NOT** forget that West Virginia **stays USA** (LOCKED in Treaty of Cincinnati)
9. **DO NOT** forget that Mormon Deseret is **sovereign theocracy** (LOCKED in Treaty of Cincinnati Article 7)
10. **DO NOT** forget the Northern Collapse sequence is **LOCKED CANON** - no heroic last stands
11. **DO NOT** assume OTL events still happen - check `world-building/otl-events-never-happen-ntl.md` for comprehensive list
12. **DO NOT** assume Grant becomes general-in-chief - he never gets promoted (no Gettysburg victory)
13. **DO NOT** assume Atlanta falls - it's besieged but never falls (Sherman withdraws January 1865)
14. **DO NOT** assume Sherman's March to the Sea happens - war ends before it can happen
15. **DO NOT** assume Hancock's wounding is a CSA setback - it's a CSA victory (Pickett Raid successful, Hancock wounded)

---

## WHEN IN DOUBT

1. **Check plausibility:** Is this decision ≥70% plausible?
2. **Check process:** Am I editing `books/` folder? (If yes, STOP - use `edits/` instead)
3. **Check canon:** Does this contradict established facts?
4. **Check timeline:** Does this fit the chronological sequence?
5. **Check character:** Does this fit the established character/system?
6. **Check honesty:** Am I making something up? (If yes, STOP - be honest that you don't know)

## HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY

**If you don't know something:**
- Say "I don't have that information in my context"
- Offer to search the canon documents
- Ask the user for clarification
- **DO NOT** invent details to fill gaps

**If details are missing:**
- Acknowledge what's missing
- Ask if the user wants you to search for it
- Wait for explicit instruction before creating new content

**The user will explicitly ask when they want you to:**
- Create new world-building elements
- Invent details for narrative purposes
- Fill in gaps with plausible speculation
- Generate new content

**Until then: Be honest about what you don't know.**

## CLAUDE REVIEW FIXES – LOCKED 5 DECEMBER 2025

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED CANON – NO FURTHER CHANGES  
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Source:** External Peer Review (Claude Evaluation) - Archival Assistant's Report

The following six elements have been stress-tested, revised, and are now LOCKED CANON.

**Overall Impact:** Plausibility of entire framework raised from 85–90% to **88–92%**.

| # | New Locked Canon Entry | Plausibility | One-Line Justification |
|---|------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **Native Super-States as "Embattled Survivors"** | 72–75 % | Sequoyah thrives on Cherokee core; Plains nations fragment by 1900; survival via constant diplomacy and USA/CSA mutual deterrence |
| 2 | **Mormon Deseret Banking Neutrality** | 75 % | Deseret is the "Mormon Venice" of North America: pious theocratic republic that survives by banking for infidels, charging fair interest, keeping perfect ledgers, and maintaining armed neutrality |
| 3 | **Transcontinental Rail Routes Bypass Native Territories** | 85–90 % | USA builds northern route through Canada; CSA builds southern route through Mexico; both longer and costlier → explains California's Pacific port dominance |
| 4 | **WWI Zimmerman Crisis Chapter (1917)** | 82–85 % | Germany offers CSA Kentucky/Missouri; telegram leaked → tri-nation Concord declaration of armed neutrality; war lasts 1914–1919 |
| 5 | **Alaska Purchase – Failed USA Blockade (1875)** | 78–80 % | USA attempts naval blockade of Russian transfer; fails due to exhaustion and lack of Pacific fleet → reinforces post-war weakness |
| 6 | **Second KKK Suppression – Economic Motive** | 78–80 % | Every racial incident extends the global boycott another year; CSA cracks down not from morality but because Night Riders cost millions in lost trade |

### 1. Native Super-States – "Embattled Survivors" (72–75%)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Document:** `world-building/native-super-states-embattled-survivors.md`

- Native super-states are **not** super-powers; they are **embattled survivors**
- Sequoyah thrives on Cherokee core; Plains nations fragment by 1900
- Survival via constant diplomacy and USA/CSA mutual deterrence
- No transcontinental rail through Native territories

### 2. Mormon Deseret – "The Mormon Venice" (75%)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Document:** `world-building/mormon-deseret-banking-neutrality.md`

- Theocratic banking republic that survives by banking for infidels
- Commodity-backed, religiously obsessive honesty, armed neutrality
- Holds Concord Treaty deposits, USA/CSA/California accounts
- "We serve God by serving Mammon honestly"

### 3. Transcontinental Rail Routes Bypass Native Territories (85–90%)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Document:** `world-building/transcontinental-rail-routes-bypass.md`

- USA: northern route through Canada (Chicago–Vancouver, completed 1885)
- CSA: southern route through Mexico (New Orleans–Guaymas, completed 1890)
- Both longer, costlier → explains California's Pacific port dominance

### 4. WWI Zimmerman Crisis Chapter (1917) – Explicit Chapter Required (82–85%)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED - Explicit Chapter Required  
**Document:** `world-building/wwi-duration-zimmerman-crisis-explicit-chapter.md`

- Germany offers CSA Kentucky/Missouri
- Telegram leaked → tri-nation Concord declaration of armed neutrality
- War lasts 1914–1919; ends in exhaustion stalemate

### 5. Alaska Purchase – Failed USA Blockade (1875) (78–80%)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Document:** `world-building/alaska-purchase-1875-1876.md`

- USA attempts naval blockade of Russian transfer
- Fails due to exhaustion and lack of Pacific fleet
- Reinforces post-war USA weakness

### 6. Second KKK Suppression – Economic Motive (78–80%)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Document:** `world-building/second-kkk-suppression-economic-motive.md`

- Every racial incident extends the global boycott another year
- CSA cracks down not from morality but because Night Riders cost millions in lost trade
- No second KKK brand; local violence persists but never reorganises nationally

---

**Note:** All six fixes are now LOCKED CANON. Plausibility of entire framework raised from 85–90% to **88–92%**. Status: LOCKED – NO FURTHER CHANGES.

## OTL EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPEN IN NTL - LOCKED CANON

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED CANON  
**Plausibility:** 93% overall  
**Date:** December 5, 2025

**Key Finding:** Many major OTL events from July 1863 to April 1865 **never happen in NTL** because:
1. Lee dies, Longstreet withdraws → Gettysburg ends after Day 1
2. No Overland Campaign (Grant never promoted to general-in-chief)
3. No Siege of Petersburg (war ends before it can begin)
4. No Sherman's March to the Sea (war ends before it can happen)
5. Lincoln loses 1864 election (McClellan wins on peace platform)
6. No 13th Amendment (no Union victory)

### Category 1: Definitely Never Happen (95-100% certainty)

**Military:** Gettysburg Days 2-3, Overland Campaign, Siege of Petersburg, Sheridan's Shenandoah Campaign, Sherman's March to the Sea, Hood's Tennessee Campaign, Fall of Richmond, Lee's surrender at Appomattox

**Political:** Lincoln's re-election, Lincoln's Second Inaugural, 13th Amendment, Hampton Roads Peace Conference, Entire Reconstruction Era

**Leadership:** Grant promoted to General-in-Chief, Sheridan commands Cavalry Corps East, Meade subordinated to Grant

### Category 2: Likely Still Happen (75-90% certainty)

**Military (Western):** Vicksburg surrender (reduced morale impact), Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Grant's Western promotion, Red River Campaign, Battle of Mobile Bay

**Political/Social:** New York Draft Riots (worse: ~1,500-1,800 casualties vs. OTL ~1,200), Andersonville Prison opens

**Confederate:** Bragg replaced by Johnston

### Category 3: Uncertain / Different Outcome

**Atlanta Campaign:** Starts May 1864, reaches suburbs August 1864, becomes prolonged siege, never falls (Sherman withdraws January 1865) - 87% plausibility

**Hood replaces Johnston:** July 17, 1864 - CSA seizes opportunity (Eastern success creates momentum, need aggressive action in West) - 87% plausibility

**Fort Pillow Massacre:** Depends on Western Theater details - 75% plausibility

### Category 4: Explicitly Different / New NTL Events

**Sherman's March to Appomattox:** January 29 - February 22, 1865 - Weather defeats Sherman, not Confederate military - 94% plausibility

**See:** `world-building/otl-events-never-happen-ntl.md` for comprehensive list
