## POINT OF DIVERGENCE

**Night, July 1, 1863** - General Robert E. Lee dies on Seminary Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

**04:00, July 2, 1863** - General James Longstreet assumes command and makes the decision to withdraw north.

**Longstreet's Written Order (one sentence):**
> "Face the army about and march by the left flank on the Mummasburg–Carlisle–Harrisburg road with all possible speed."

---

## LOCKED ASSUMPTIONS

- Longstreet in command from 04:00, July 2
- Immediate countermarch **north** on the Mummasburg–Heidlersburg–Carlisle axis (NOT west, NOT Chambersburg Pike, NOT South Mountain gaps)
- Meade frozen in paralysis for **36 hours** (July 2-3) - five factors: caution + Lee-death confusion + army exhaustion + cavalry collapse + Washington telegraph delay
- No meaningful Union pursuit begins until dawn, July 4

  - Engineers begin fortifying Camp Hill heights
  - Harrisburg fully occupied: Capitol, arsenal, treasury, all rail bridges in Confederate hands
  - Longstreet's headquarters in state capitol building
- **Union:** **Meade finally issues pursuit orders** – VI Corps to step off at dawn July 4, rest of army to follow on parallel roads.
- **Distance:** 40–45 miles

**What Longstreet Has Achieved by 18:00, July 3:**
- The Susquehanna at Meade's back instead of his own
- 18,000–20,000 extra rifles and muskets (enough to fully re-arm two Confederate corps) and millions in Pennsylvania state funds
- A 40–45 mile head start (with river barrier)
- Three separate rail lines to live off

- **Distance:** 45–50 miles

---

### JULY 3-10, 1863: HARRISBURG OCCUPATION (7 DAYS)

**Longstreet's Explicit Guidance (Night of July 3):**
> "We are guests for one week only. By the 10th of July every man, gun, and wagon will be on the move again. We rest, we feed, we refit—but we do **not** dig in for a siege."

| Date | Location of Main Forces | What Happens in/around Harrisburg | Longstreet's Personal HQ / Key Events |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **3 July pm** | Early's division enters city; Johnson & Rodes across river that night | Capitol surrounded at 14:00. Mayor surrenders at 16:30 under generous terms (no looting, militia paroled). Arsenal (18,000–20,000 rifles and muskets), treasury, and all rail shops seized. | Longstreet rides in at 19:00; sets up HQ in the Capitol building itself (governor's office). First night sleeps four hours on a cot. |
| **4 July** | First & Third Corps close up west bank (Camp Hill – Hogestown ridge line) | Independence Day parade (forced) by Early's men through downtown. 5,000 fresh horses requisitioned from Cumberland & Lebanon valleys. Engineers throw two pontoon bridges west of city. | Longstreet issues "Proclamation to the People of Pennsylvania" (see full text below). |
| **5 July** | Second Corps (Ewell's old corps) holds east bank bridgehead at Wrightsville/Columbia | Northern Central Railway torn up south of York to slow any Union flanking move. 1,200 Union prisoners from Gettysburg hospitals paroled and sent north. | Longstreet holds only one council of war the entire week (evening). Four options formally tabled (see Strategic Options table below). No decision yet. |
| **6–7 July** | Entire army in bivouac within 8-mile radius of city | Systematic foraging parties strip Cumberland, Perry, and Dauphin counties. Wagon train grows from ~900 to ~2,200 vehicles (many driven by impressed Pennsylvania teamsters under guard). Every regiment issued new blankets and shoes from Pennsylvania factories. | Longstreet finally sleeps 6–7 hours a night. Seen walking the Camp Hill heights at dawn every day with a cup of coffee, staring south. |
| **8 July** | Decision day. Departure orders cut at 04:00 | Longstreet chooses **Option 3 – Reading & the Schuylkill** (three-day lightning raid to destroy Northern coal infrastructure, then southwest pivot). Orders: army will begin marching at dawn 10 July on the Lebanon Valley Turnpike toward Reading. | Final night in Harrisburg. Longstreet leaves a signed note on the governor's desk: "We borrowed your capital for a week. We will return it in better condition than we found it." |
| **9 July** | Final preparations | Army prepares for fast march. Light loads, maximum speed. | Longstreet finalizes raid plan: Reading destruction, then southwest swing. |
| **10 July dawn** | First Corps (Hood & McLaws) + cavalry screen march southeast | Harrisburg → Lebanon on Lebanon Valley Turnpike | Longstreet rides with advance guard. Meade still thinks Longstreet is digging in on the Susquehanna. |

**Net Results of the Seven-Day Occupation:**
- Army rested, re-shod, re-horsed, and re-armed
- Wagons doubled in size (now living off Pennsylvania instead of Virginia)
- 6–8 days of rations on the hoof
- Meade still 80–100 miles behind and fixated on the wrong axis
- Longstreet has chosen Option 3: Reading & the Schuylkill (not Baltimore)

**Key Point:** Seven days is the absolute maximum Longstreet is willing to give the army—and he only takes that long because the men and horses desperately need it. By the morning of 10 July the Confederate army is moving again, fat, fresh, and aimed at Reading for a lightning raid that will destroy Northern coal infrastructure.

## LONGSTREET'S PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA

**Issued:** July 4, 1863  
**Location:** Harrisburg, Pennsylvania  
**Context:** Independence Day, one day after occupying the state capital

---

**PROCLAMATION**

Head-Quarters, Army of Northern Virginia

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

July 4, 1863

To the People of Pennsylvania:

The army under my command now occupies your capital city.

We did not come as conquerors seeking to hold it, nor as brigands seeking to destroy it. We came to remind the Government at Washington that the war it wages upon Virginia can be waged upon Pennsylvania with equal justice and greater ease.

For two years the soil of the Southern States has been made to drink the blood of her sons and the tears of her daughters. Your fields have been spared that sorrow. Until now.

Seven days ago the Army of the Potomac lay upon the field of Gettysburg. Had its commander pursued the course I urged upon my late superior, General Lee (of blessed memory), that army would have been compelled to attack us in positions of our own choosing, and the war might already have been decided in Virginia's favor. Instead, Providence removed General Lee from this earth, and with him the plan of battle he had fixed upon. I have therefore withdrawn this army from the field, not in defeat, but to carry the war to the homes and hearths of those who have so long believed themselves immune from its horrors.

While we remain in Harrisburg:

- Private property will be respected and paid for in Confederate scrip or Pennsylvania bank notes at fair valuation.
- All public property of the United States and of the State of Pennsylvania—arms, ammunition, stores, treasury funds, and railroad equipment—is declared lawful prize of war and will be seized.
- Citizens who remain quiet in their homes and take no part against us will suffer no molestation.
- Any person bearing arms against this army, destroying bridges, tearing up railroads, or cutting telegraph wires will be treated as a guerrilla and dealt with according to the laws of war.

The Confederate States desire peace. We have no wish to annex your territory or to subjugate your people. We seek only the recognition of our independence. When that independence is acknowledged, this army will leave Pennsylvania as willingly as it entered it, and the war will be at an end.

Until that day, the responsibility for every barn that burns, every rail that is torn up, and every field that is trampled rests not with the soldiers now in your streets, but with the Government in Washington that refuses to make peace.

Given under my hand in the Capitol of Pennsylvania, this fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the Confederate States the third.

**James Longstreet**  
Lieutenant-General, Commanding

---

**Key Points:**
- **Tone:** Firm but not brutal; seeks to justify rather than terrorize
- **Reference to Lee:** Acknowledges Lee's death and Longstreet's disagreement with his plan
- **Justification:** "Carry the war to the homes and hearths" - making Pennsylvania feel what Virginia felt
- **Rules of conduct:** Clear guidelines for both army and civilians
- **Peace message:** Emphasizes Confederate desire for peace and recognition
- **Blame shifting:** Responsibility for destruction placed on Washington, not the army
- **Historical parallel:** Echoes Lee's 1863 orders but with Longstreet's pragmatic voice

---

### JULY 10-20, 1863: THE SCHUYLKILL RAID & SWING

**Strategy:** Three-day lightning raid to Reading, one day of destruction, then immediate southwest pivot. Keeps every advantage Longstreet has built and gives Meade zero time to recover.

| Date | Action | Location | Distance Covered | Strategic Effect |
|------|--------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **10–11 July** | First Corps (Hood & McLaws) + cavalry screen march southeast on the Lebanon Valley Turnpike | Harrisburg → Lebanon | 28 mi (Day 1) | Meade still thinks Longstreet is digging in on the Susquehanna |
| **12 July** | Lead elements enter Reading at noon; city surrenders by 15:00 | Lebanon → Reading | 28 mi (Day 2) | Cuts every rail line from the anthracite region; coal famine panic begins in Pittsburgh, New York, and New England |
| **13–14 July** | Full army closes up. Systematic 48-hour destruction: <br>– All Schuylkill Canal locks blown <br>– 14 railroad bridges dropped <br>– 200+ locomotives and 2,000 coal cars torched <br>– Reading Railroad shops gutted <br>*(The last bridges were still burning behind them as the column marched southwest)* | Reading | Local | Northern industry loses 40–50% of its anthracite supply. Destruction continues even as army departs. |
| **15 July** | Army faces about and marches **southwest** at dawn. Axis: Reading → Pottstown → Valley Forge → Chester → Wilmington | Reading → West Chester | 35–40 mi | Meade finally realises and starts scrambling east; he's still 100+ miles away |
| **16–19 July** | Fast march down the Chester Valley (parallel roads + rail bed) → crosses into Delaware | West Chester → Wilmington | 60–70 mi total | Completely wrong-foots Meade; Union garrisons at Perryville and Havre de Grace are bypassed |
| **20–21 July** | Army reaches the upper Chesapeake (Elkton–North East, Md.) and threatens Baltimore **from the south-east** while Meade is still north of the Susquehanna | North East, Md. | 40 mi | Now Longstreet can either: <br>1. Snap up Baltimore from the rear <br>2. Mask it and march straight on Washington <br>3. Cross the Chesapeake and raid Annapolis |

**Why This Is the Killer Sequence:**

1. **Speed & Deception** – Three hard marching days to Reading, one day of pure destruction, then immediate pivot. Meade is always reacting to the **last** place Longstreet was.

2. **Economic Decapitation** – The Schuylkill Canal + Reading Railroad carried ~50% of the North's hard coal in 1863. Knocking it out for even 60–90 days is a strategic disaster bigger than losing a city.

3. **Geography** – The Lebanon–Reading–Chester corridor is a natural interior-line highway that runs **perpendicular** to Meade's expected axis. Every mile Longstreet moves east/southeast is a mile Meade has to move **laterally** across a river he hasn't even reached yet.

4. **Flexibility** – After torching Reading, Longstreet can still threaten Philadelphia (30 miles east), Baltimore (50 miles south), or Washington (80 miles southwest) without ever having committed to any single one.

**Narrative Payoff:**
- Longstreet never "lollygags." He's in Reading for **48-60 hours**—just long enough to burn the industrial lifeline of the North and ride out. The last bridges are still burning behind them as the column marches southwest.
- The swing southwest turns the raid into a strategic scythe that cuts across Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland while Meade is still trying to get his army across one river.
- By 20 July the Army of Northern Virginia is camped on the Chesapeake shore with Baltimore to its right, Washington to its left, and Philadelphia in its rear-view mirror.

**Result:** It's the deepest, fastest, most devastating penetration any Confederate army ever achieved—and it all happens in under two weeks after leaving Harrisburg. Reading raid → scorched coal → southwest swing → pick your poison (Baltimore, Washington, or both). No lollygagging. Just fire, speed, and terror.

### LATE JULY - DECEMBER 1863: THE AFTERMATH

| Date | Event | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Late July 1863** | Longstreet's last elements cross the Potomac at Williamsport / Shepherdstown. Army back in Virginia, fat and laughing. | Northern newspapers screaming "HARRISBURG—READING—BALTIMORE THREATENED—AND HE JUST WALKED AWAY!" |
| **1 August** | Lincoln summons Halleck, Stanton, and the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. Meade is scapegoated on the spot. | Meade relieved "for want of aggression." |
| **3 August** | Command of the Army of the Potomac given to Gouverneur K. Warren (young, aggressive engineer, topographical corps veteran, politically clean). Alternative candidate was John Reynolds—but he's dead at Gettysburg in this timeline too. | Warren is told in writing: "Restore the offensive spirit of the army or we lose the war this winter." |
| **August–September** | Warren frantically reorganizes, purges "Meade conservatives," brings up every new regiment and 100-gun battery he can beg from the defenses of Washington. | Army swells back to ~110,000, but it's full of bounty men and the veterans are exhausted and bitter. |
| **October 1863** | Lincoln and Stanton demand a fall campaign "to erase the stigma of 1863." Warren has no choice. | The Rappahannock–Rapidan Campaign begins—the Union's last offensive of the year. |
| **November 1863** | Warren crosses the Potomac in three columns, trying to turn Longstreet out of his Culpeper–Orange Court House defenses. | Longstreet has spent three months fortifying every ford, ridge, and railroad cut from Fredericksburg to Gordonsville. |
| **10–25 November** | Series of brutal, one-sided battles along the Rapidan line (Mine Run on steroids, but worse). Longstreet simply repeats Marye's Heights / North Anna tactics at every river crossing. The "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder": one corps smashed at the Rapidan, another bled out at the Rappahannock, a third shattered at the Occoquan. Three separate killing grounds, not one continuous battle. | Union losses approach 20–25,000 in two weeks. Warren's army staggers back north "a bloody stump." Northern newspapers coin the phrase "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder." |
| **December 1863** | Army of the Potomac goes into winter quarters north of the Occoquan, shattered, mutinous, and out of fight. | Northern morale collapses. Copperhead gains in midterm elections become unstoppable. |
| **1 January 1864** | Warren relieved after the disastrous fall campaign and congressional inquiry. Lincoln issues 1,400-word letter "after mature consideration" - but Stanton had the order drafted October 24, Committee voted November 12. The "Mature Consideration Farce" becomes one of the most bitterly remembered moments in the timeline. | Official order: "Relieved for want of results and loss of offensive spirit." See Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign timeline for full details. |
| **3 January 1864** | Winfield Scott Hancock takes command of the Army of the Potomac. | Hancock inherits a demoralized, mutinous army. Tasked with rebuilding morale and effectiveness. |

**Key Points:**
- **Meade's fate:** Relieved "for want of aggression" - scapegoated for the 36-hour delay
- **Warren's command:** Young, aggressive, but inherits a demoralized army; leads disastrous fall campaign
- **Warren's relief:** Relieved January 1, 1864 after the disastrous Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign
- **Hancock's command:** Takes command January 3, 1864, inherits shattered army
- **The fall campaign:** Forced by political pressure, ends in disaster (20-25,000 losses)
- **Longstreet's preparation:** Three months to fortify positions while Union reorganizes
- **Northern collapse:** Morale shattered, Copperheads gain power, peace talks become inevitable

### SPRING-SUMMER 1864: CONFEDERATE RAIDING STRATEGY

**Longstreet's Strategic Evolution:**

Longstreet has learned the lesson of 1863 perfectly:
- Big invasions are magnets for big disasters
- Small, fast, cavalry-heavy corps that live off the country and never, ever stand to fight a major battle are the new Confederate strategy

**The Pattern: Multiple Raids, Not Just One**

Throughout spring and summer 1864, Longstreet launches a series of raids of varying sizes. Pickett's Lightning Raid (June-July) is the largest and most successful, but it's part of a broader strategic pattern:

- **Spring 1864:** Smaller raids by Hampton, Fitzhugh Lee, and other cavalry commanders
- **Targets:** Railroads, supply depots, isolated garrisons
- **Purpose:** Keep Union forces off-balance, disrupt supply lines, demonstrate Confederate mobility
- **Results:** Varying success, but all contribute to the overall strategic picture of Confederate forces operating with impunity in the North

**Pickett's raid is simply the biggest and most successful of these operations.**

**The Strategic Context:**

Throughout the spring and summer of 1864, Longstreet waged war with a dozen small irons rather than one great hammer. While Pickett's great raid seized the headlines, Hampton severed the Orange & Alexandria for the third time in six months, Fitzhugh Lee burned the railroad bridge at Hanover Junction yet again, and Rosser's Laurens Brigade cut the B&O west of Cumberland so often that Northern papers simply began listing "Rebel cavalry on the line" as a permanent weather report. By the time Pickett recrossed the Potomac in July, the Northern public had endured twenty-four months of proof that the Confederacy could strike anywhere north of Washington and disappear before the first blue regiment arrived. One more summer of that, and the ballot box did what the battlefield never could.

---

### JUNE-JULY 1864: THE "LIGHTNING RAID" - PICKETT'S RIDE

**The Tool: Pickett's "Flying Corps"**

Formed over the winter of 1863-64:
- Pickett's own division (now ~7,500 veteran infantry, fully remounted)
- Fitzhugh Lee's and Lomax's cavalry divisions combined (~6,000 sabers)
- 24 horse-artillery pieces (6 batteries of 4 guns each)
- **Total strength:** ~14,000 men, 16,000 horses, 24 guns
- Every man mounted or in light wagons. No heavy baggage train.

**Longstreet's Written Orders to Pickett (Hand-delivered, 1 June 1864):**
> "You are to cross the Potomac with all speed, ride north and east as far and as fast as prudence allows, burn everything military that will burn, cut every railroad you can reach, and return with your command intact.
>
> You are expressly forbidden to fight a pitched battle or risk the loss of more than one regiment in any single action.
>
> If you bring the corps home whole, you will have done more for our independence than any victory Lee ever won."

**The Ride (14 June – 22 July 1864):**

| Date | Location / Action | Distance Covered | Result |
|------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| **14–17 June** | Crosses at Point of Rocks / Edwards Ferry → rides north through Frederick | 80 mi | Union garrisons bypassed or scattered |
| **18–22 June** | Cuts the B&O main line in four places west of Baltimore → burns Monocacy bridge | 60 mi | Baltimore & Ohio Railroad severed for weeks |
| **23–28 June** | Swings east through Westminster → tears up Northern Central for 30 miles | 90 mi | Baltimore isolated from the north |
| **29 June – 4 July** | Reaches the outskirts of Lancaster and Reading → burns 200+ coal cars and canal boats | 70 mi | Second coal panic of the war |
| **5–10 July** | Turns south through Chester County → destroys the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad at three points | 80 mi | Philadelphia's direct rail link to Washington cut |
| **11–15 July** | Rides south-west along the Chesapeake shore → burns gunboats at Havre de Grace | 90 mi | Threatens a repeat descent on Baltimore from the south-east |
| **16–22 July** | Recrosses the Potomac at Leesylvania / Occoquan with every man and gun intact | 120 mi | Back in Virginia by 22 July |

**Total Distance:** ~750 miles in 38 days  
**Average:** 19–20 miles per day – easy for a mounted force living off Pennsylvania farms

**Losses:**
- Fewer than 400 total (mostly stragglers and light skirmish casualties)
- Not a single regiment lost, not one gun abandoned

**Northern Reaction:**
- Lincoln screams for another offensive
- Hancock (in command since January 1864, after Warren's relief) refuses to move until August, citing "complete absence of cavalry intelligence"
- Copperhead newspapers crow: "Lee took an army north and lost it. Longstreet sends a corps and brings every man home laughing"

**Strategic Impact:**
By the time the 1864 presidential election arrives, the North has suffered two straight summers of Confederate raids—both large-scale invasions (1863) and smaller but persistent raids (1864). Confederate cavalry rides wherever they please, burns whatever they want, and leaves before anyone can catch them. Pickett's raid is the largest and most successful, but it's part of a pattern of constant harassment.

**Result:** McClellan wins in a landslide on a peace platform.

**Key Points:**
- **New Confederate strategy:** Small, fast, mounted forces instead of large invasions
- **Pattern of raids:** Pickett's is the largest, but part of a broader spring-summer raiding campaign
- **Pickett's redemption:** Transformed from failed division commander to successful raider
- **Economic warfare:** Targets railroads, coal infrastructure, and military supplies
- **Zero risk doctrine:** Never fight a pitched battle, always return intact
- **Political impact:** Two summers of Confederate raids (large-scale 1863, persistent smaller raids 1864) make peace platform inevitable

---

### JULY 5, 1863

#### DAWN - STRATEGIC OPTIONS
- **Confederate:** Longstreet now has **four strategic options** to consider:
  1. **Lancaster–Philadelphia Strike** - 88–95 mi to Philadelphia suburbs, 5–6 marching days, very low Meade interference risk, takes largest city & financial center
  2. **"Hold & Destroy" on the Susquehanna** - Already there, 0 marching days, medium risk, turns river into Confederate Chancellorsville/Fredericksburg
  3. **Raid-in-force toward Reading & the Schuylkill** - 65–70 mi to Reading, 4 days, low risk, cuts every rail line from anthracite coal fields
  4. **Cumberland Valley Feint → Swing south to Washington** - 110 mi to Washington outskirts, 7–8 days, medium risk, puts national capital in jeopardy
- **Union:** Meade's vanguard (VI Corps) reaches Carlisle – finds the town empty except for Hampton's burning warehouses.
- **Distance:** 50–55 miles (Confederate forces still at/near Harrisburg)

#### NOON - STRATEGIC REALIZATION
- **Confederate:** Longstreet has not yet chosen. He is still refitting, tearing up rail south of York to slow Meade, and letting Meade decide which city he has to save first. (See Harrisburg Occupation section for full timeline.)
- **Union:** Meade finally realizes the Susquehanna is now in his front and Longstreet in his rear.
- **Distance:** 50–55 miles (Confederate forces still at/near Harrisburg)

## LONGSTREET'S STRATEGIC OPTIONS (JULY 5, 1863)

Longstreet's council of war considered four options while in Harrisburg:

| Option | Axis | Distance from Harrisburg | Time to Objective | Meade Interference Risk | Strategic Payoff |
|--------|------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **1. Lancaster–Philadelphia Strike** | Harrisburg → Columbia bridge → Lancaster → Downingtown → West Chester → Philadelphia | 88–95 mi to Philadelphia suburbs | 5–6 marching days (16–18 mi/day) | Very low – Meade would have to swing 70 miles east across the Susquehanna | Takes the largest city & financial center in the North, forces total Northern strategic paralysis |
| **2. "Hold & Destroy" on the Susquehanna** | Camp Hill – Hogestown – White Hill ridge line (west bank) | Already there | 0 marching days | Medium – Meade must cross a defended 1,000-yard river | Turns the river into a Confederate Chancellorsville/Fredericksburg rolled into one |
| **3. Raid-in-force toward Reading & the Schuylkill** | Harrisburg → Lebanon → Reading → Norristown | 65–70 mi to Reading | 4 days | Low – completely off Meade's expected axis | Cuts every rail line from the anthracite coal fields and the upper Delaware; starves Northern industry |
| **4. Cumberland Valley Feint → Swing south to Washington** | Fake continuation west, then pivot south through Shippensburg → Hagerstown → Frederick | 110 mi to Washington outskirts | 7–8 days | Medium – Meade might beat him to Frederick | Puts the national capital itself in jeopardy again |

**Longstreet's Choice (July 8, 04:00):** Option 3 – Reading & the Schuylkill. Chosen for speed, low risk, and maximum economic impact. The raid destroys Northern coal infrastructure, then pivots southwest to maintain flexibility.

## DETAILED WITHDRAWAL SEQUENCE (JULY 2, 04:00-07:00)

| Time Window | Unit(s) | Night Position (1 July) | Road Taken | Direction & Objective |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| 04:00–04:15 | Reserve artillery trains + corps ammunition wagons | Already parked north-west of town along Mummasburg Road | Mummasburg Road → Table Rock → Heidlersburg | Straight north – trains are absolute priority |
| 04:05–04:25 | **Rodes' Division** – Daniel's brigade | Oak Hill and fields north of railroad cut | Mummasburg Road north | Daniel pulls out first – sitting on the road |
| 04:15–04:40 | Rodes – Doles, Ramseur, O'Neal, Iverson | Northern edge of town and railroad cut | All file onto Mummasburg Road behind Daniel | By 05:00 entire division in column |
| 04:20–04:50 | **Early's Division** – Hays, Avery, Gordon, Hoke-minus-Smith | East and northeast side of town | Pull back through town square → left turn onto Carlisle / Harrisburg Road | Countermarch through Gettysburg streets |
| 04:40–05:15 | **Johnson's Division** – Steuart, Jones, Nicholls, Walker | East of Culp's Hill / Rock Creek | Rock Creek bridge → Hanover Rd. → left on Carlisle Rd. at Heidlersburg | March west through town first, then north – last of Second Corps |
| 04:30–05:30 | **Anderson's Division** (Third Corps) – Wilcox, Mahone, Wright, Posey, Perry | Herr Ridge / Seminary Ridge (western face) | Fairfield Rd. → Mummasburg Rd. → north | Swing around west side of town |
| 04:45–05:45 | **Pender's Division** – Lane, Thomas, Scales, McGowan | Herr Ridge reserve | Same Fairfield → Mummasburg route | Follows Anderson |
| 05:00–06:00 | **Heth / Pettigrew** – battered remnants | Seminary Ridge proper | Same loop around west side of town → Mummasburg Rd. | Slowest due to casualties and exhaustion |
| 05:00–06:30 | **Hood & McLaws** (First Corps) | Hood near Marsh Creek, McLaws near Black Horse Tavern | Immediate 180° turn → Fairfield Rd. → Mummasburg Rd. → north | Simply reverse and march straight |
| 05:30–07:00 | **Pickett's Division** – still near Chambersburg | 22 miles west | Ordered at 04:30 to swing northeast on Greenwood–Fairfield road, join at Cashtown Gap, then turn north | Acts as temporary left-flank guard |

---

## ROAD FLOW BY SUNRISE (≈05:30, JULY 2)

- **Single file column** on the **Mummasburg → Table Rock → Heidlersburg → Carlisle Pike** (modern PA-34 / old US-15 north)
- **Head of column** (reserve artillery + Daniel's brigade) already 5–6 miles north of Gettysburg
- **Tail of column** (Heth/Pettigrew + Hood) still clearing the western edge of town
- **Entire army** using **one primary road** with occasional parallel farm lanes – classic interior-lines march, but congested for the first 6–8 hours

---

## UNION REACTION TIMELINE

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 04:45 | First grey light |
| 05:30–06:00 | Buford's vedettes on northern picket line report movement |
| 06:30 | Hancock/Howard wake Meade |
| 07:30–08:00 | Meade's earliest possible reconnaissance in force north |
| 12:00 | First confused reports: "Rebs seem to be leaving" – Meade thinks trap |
| 18:00 | Council of war – "It's Chancellorsville again" – decides to wait |
| 3 July dawn | Buford confirms entire Confederate army marching north – Meade still waits |
| 3 July 12:00 | Harrisburg mayor sends white-flag delegation – panic in Washington |
| **3 July 18:00** | **Meade finally issues march orders** (36 hours after withdrawal began) |

**By the time Meade can react (07:30-08:00), Longstreet already has 3–4 hours head start and 8–10 miles of road dust between him and Cemetery Hill.**

---

## KEY LOCATIONS

- **Gettysburg** - Starting point (July 2, 04:00)
- **Mummasburg** - First road north
- **Table Rock / Heidlersburg** - Army passes through (July 2, 18:00)
- **Carlisle** - Main bivouac (July 2 dusk), rearguard position (July 3-5)
- **York** - Surrenders without shot (July 2, 18:00)
- **Harrisburg** - State capital, occupied (July 3, 14:00)
- **Susquehanna River** - Natural barrier, Confederate rear protection
- **Camp Hill** - West bank heights, fortified position
- **Mount Holly Springs** - VI Corps bivouac (July 4 dusk)
- **Erie** - Pennsylvania state government refuge

---

## STRATEGIC SITUATION BY JULY 5

### Confederate Position:
- **Harrisburg captured** (state capital, arsenal, treasury)
- **Susquehanna River** protecting rear
- **Three strategic options** within 48 hours
- **50–55 mile lead** on Meade (geographic advantage, not just distance)
- **Rail infrastructure** under control
- **18,000–20,000 rifles and muskets** captured (enough to fully re-arm two Confederate corps)
- **6 weeks of food** requisitioned
- **5,000 fresh horses** requisitioned

### Union Position:
- **Meade finally moving** (36 hours too late)
- **Susquehanna River** now in front (must cross to pursue)
- **Longstreet in rear** (strategic reversal)
- **50–55 miles behind** (but must cross river to close the gap)
- **Panic in Washington**
- **State government fled** to Erie

### Strategic Reversal:
By July 5, 1863, the war in the East is no longer about Gettysburg—it's about:
- Which Northern city falls first (Baltimore? Philadelphia? Lancaster?)
- Whether Meade dares to cross a mile-wide river against an army that has had four full days to choose and prepare the battlefield

## WHY 36-HOUR DELAY IS BELIEVABLE

**Meade's Psychology:**
- Exhausted (arrived at Cemetery Hill 03:00, July 2)
- Terrified of a Chancellorsville rerun
- Has no cavalry screen to the north
- Every report on July 2 says "the enemy is still in our front"
- Plausible deniability: "I needed to wait for VI Corps and the trains"

**Critical Factor - Meade Doesn't Know Lee Has Died:**
- **Meade is making assumptions based on how Lee would behave, not Longstreet**
- Meade expects Lee's aggressive, attack-oriented tactics
- Meade thinks any withdrawal is a feint or trap (classic Lee maneuver)
- Meade cannot conceive that the Confederate army would actually withdraw north
- This explains why Meade dismisses early reports as "feints" and waits so long
- Meade is fighting the ghost of Lee, not the reality of Longstreet's command

**Why 36 Hours Works Dramatically:**
- Long enough for Longstreet to do something truly dramatic
- Gives Longstreet a 40–45 mile head start (with river barrier)
- Perfect balance of dramatic and defensible
- Meade's delay is compounded by fighting the wrong enemy (Lee's ghost vs. Longstreet's reality)

## KEY CHARACTER NOTES

### J.E.B. Stuart's Situation

**Stuart's Position:** Coming to Gettysburg from the northeast when Lee dies and Longstreet assumes command.

**Consequence:** Stuart never reaches Gettysburg in this timeline. The Confederate army withdraws north before Stuart can arrive.

**Impact on Longstreet:** Stuart's delay in getting to Gettysburg destroys whatever trust Longstreet might have had for him. After this, Stuart is never allowed off the proverbial "apron strings" - Longstreet keeps him on a tight leash.

**Cavalry Leadership:** Either Fitzhugh Lee or Hampton takes over whatever tasks Stuart might have been assigned. This explains why Fitzhugh Lee is able to ride into York unopposed on July 2, 18:00, and why Hampton's cavalry screens the army's movements.

**Historical Note:** In the actual timeline, Stuart's absence at Gettysburg was a major factor in Lee's lack of intelligence. In this timeline, that absence becomes permanent in terms of Longstreet's trust, even if Stuart eventually rejoins the army.

---

## CAMPAIGN SUMMARY: THE STRATEGIC OUTCOME

By the time the North finally wakes up to what just happened (late July / early August), Longstreet has:

- **Spent less than three weeks total** north of the Potomac after Gettysburg
- **Captured and abandoned Harrisburg** (7-day occupation)
- **Burned the Schuylkill coal lifeline** (Reading destruction)
- **Marched clean across Pennsylvania, Delaware, and northern Maryland**
- **Threatened Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington in sequence**
- **Already back south of the Rappahannock** with 20,000+ new horses, full wagons, and an army that hasn't gone hungry since June

**The Strategic Achievement:**

Longstreet doesn't need to hold a single Northern city. He just needs to prove the Union can't stop him from going wherever he wants, whenever he wants.

Then he tips his hat, rides south laughing, and lets the North spend the winter arguing over whose fault it was while the Army of Northern Virginia winters fat and happy in Culpeper and Orange Counties.

**The Result:**

That's the campaign that doesn't just win Southern independence; it humiliates the North so thoroughly that peace talks start before the first snow falls.

**The Foundation:**

And every mile of it is built on:
- The seven days he stole in Harrisburg (rest, refit, decision-making)
- The 36 hours Meade gave him for free (paralysis and hesitation)

**Timeline Summary:**
- **July 1 (night):** Lee dies
- **July 2-3:** Withdrawal and march to Harrisburg (36-hour head start)
- **July 3-10:** Harrisburg occupation (7 days)
- **July 10-20:** Reading raid and southwest pivot (10 days)
- **Late July:** Return south of Potomac
- **August 1:** Meade relieved, Warren takes command
- **August-September:** Union reorganization
- **October-November:** Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign (Union disaster)
- **December:** Northern morale collapses, Copperheads gain power
- **January 1, 1864:** Warren relieved
- **January 3, 1864:** Hancock takes command
- **June-July 1864:** Pickett's Lightning Raid (750 miles, 38 days)
- **November 1864:** McClellan wins presidential election on peace platform
- **Before first snow:** Peace talks begin

**Total time north of Potomac (1863):** Less than three weeks  
**Strategic impact:** Humiliation so complete that peace becomes inevitable
