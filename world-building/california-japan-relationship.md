# California's Role Regarding Japan (1865-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Up to the canonical end of the series (31 December 1939), California's role is one thing and one thing only:

**The Pacific's honest, shameless, and wildly profitable oil dealer.**

## California's Policy Toward Japan (1865-1939)

| Period | California's Policy Toward Japan | Exact Role |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **1898–1930** | Sells oil, rice, steel, and movies to Japan at market prices. No embargoes, no sermons, no questions asked. | Neutral supplier |
| **1931–1939** | Continues selling oil (and everything else) even as Japan invades Manchuria and China. Quietly builds the biggest navy west of Hawaii "for regional stability." | Enabling profiteer with a battleship smile |

## The Canon Boundary

**Canon stops 31 December 1939**

The Ashes ends with the European war headlines.

Everything after (1941 Pacific War, Pearl Harbor analogue, oil cutoff, etc.) is explicitly speculative and outside the published alt-history series.

## California's Philosophy

California's role regarding Japan, 1865–1939:

**"We sell to whoever pays.  
The ocean is big.  
Business is business."**

No moralising.

No embargo.

No war.

Just money.

That's the California the reader meets in 1939.

And that's where the book leaves them.
