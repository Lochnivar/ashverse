## KEY DETAILS

**Sherman's Force:** 48,000 men (full army, not raiding force)

**Distance:** 550 miles total. 340 miles covered in 19 days before learning of Grant's defeat. 210 miles remaining when news arrives.

**Casualties:** 400 dead (exposure, accidents), 600 sick (too sick to continue), 1,500 horses dead. **Total: 1,900 casualties for nothing.**

**Weather Impact:**
- Week 1: Cold but clear (manageable)
- Week 2: Snow begins, roads icy (slowing)
- Week 3: Blizzard, freeze-thaw cycle, mud (crawling)
- **Worst winter in decades** (not normal conditions)

**Longstreet's Response:** Grants safe passage, honors word to Grant. Johnston's cavalry shadows withdrawal to protect from irregulars. No engagement - war is over.

**Result:** Weather defeats Sherman, not Confederate military. Longstreet grants honorable safe passage. Post-war mythology: **"The March That Couldn't Beat Winter."**
