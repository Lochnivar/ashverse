# The American Concord: How the Triad Functions

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The American Concord is:

a treaty  
with no teeth  
that works perfectly  
because California pays the dentist.

It is the diplomatic equivalent of three siblings (plus the Pacific Alliance, which California clearly runs):

**United States** – the moralizing older brother who still thinks he's in charge because he used to be bigger

**Confederate States** – the proud middle brother who won his independence but knows he's still working through some baggage

**Republic of California** (and the Pacific Alliance it dominates) – the rich, chill, West-Coast sibling who owns half the Pacific, writes the checks, hosts the summits, and lets the other two posture while it actually runs the show

**Note:** The Pacific Alliance (Oregon, Washington, California) participates in the Concord, but since California writes 60% of its budget and stations 70% of its ships, it's effectively still California's voice—just with Oregon and Washington sitting at the table to make it look more democratic. See `world-building/pacific-alliance-cascadia-compact.md` for details.

They're still "that" side of the family—the ones who had a rough Thanksgiving and still talk to each other, but everyone knows they're awkward around each other.  
But they know the bouncer (California) will throw them all out  
if they start swinging.

Formal enough to look respectable.  
Loose enough to keep working.

## The Answer

It is a treaty-based, permanent, but deliberately loose and toothless framework that works only because all three republics know the alternative is disaster.

## Official Name

**Treaty of American Concord**

(Signed 1921, renewed every 10 years)

## The Features

| Feature | Exact Mechanism (Locked) | Realism Check |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Legal form** | Treaty (ratified by all three legislatures) | 10/10 |
| **Command structure** | No joint command. Each nation keeps its own forces. Only coordination committees (navy, intelligence, trade). | 10/10 |
| **Mutual defence clause** | Deliberately weak: "In the event of aggression against one signatory by a non-American power, the others will consult and consider joint measures." | 10/10 – no automatic war |
| **Economic cooperation** | Zero tariffs between the three, common external tariff negotiated every 5 years. | 10/10 |
| **Summit** | Every four years, permanent host: Monterey, California (permanent seat of the American Concord). | 10/10 |
| **Real power** | California bankrolls 55–65% of joint naval construction and gets quiet veto on anything stupid. | 10/10 – money talks |

## How It Actually Works in Practice (1925–2025)

| Crisis | What the Treaty Says | What Really Happens |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Japan threatens Philippines (1937)** | "Consult" | California moves fleet, U.S. & CSA quietly agree to sell oil at "friendly" prices |
| **German U-boat sinks CSA freighter (1940)** | "Consider joint measures" | California hosts 72-hour summit in Bermuda. Germany backs down. |
| **Border incident between U.S. & CSA (1952)** | Nothing in treaty covers it | California threatens to cut both out of Pacific trade. Incident over in a week. |

## Key Provisions

### Legal Form
- Treaty (ratified by all three legislatures)
- Signed 1921, renewed every 10 years

### Command Structure
- No joint command
- Each nation keeps its own forces
- Only coordination committees (navy, intelligence, trade)

### Mutual Defence Clause
Deliberately weak: "In the event of aggression against one signatory by a non-American power, the others will consult and consider joint measures."

No automatic war. Just consultation and consideration.

### Economic Cooperation
- Zero tariffs between the three
- Common external tariff negotiated every 5 years

### Summit
Every four years, permanent host:
- **Monterey, California** (permanent seat of the American Concord)

**Note:** Monterey is the neutral salon, not the throne room. It's the North-American equivalent of Geneva or The Hague. The official line: "The City of Monterey, by its central location on the Pacific coast and its historic role as the cradle of Californian independence, is honored to serve as the permanent seat of the American Concord." The unofficial line: "They picked Monterey because California wanted it, and nobody else had the votes or the cash to argue."

### Real Power
California bankrolls 55–65% of joint naval construction and gets quiet veto on anything stupid.

Money talks.
