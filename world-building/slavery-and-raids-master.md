## SECTION 1: SLAVERY TIMELINE (1865-1905)

### 1867-68: The Toombs "African Labour Restoration Act"

#### What Happens
- Toombs re-opens the African trade
- The "Second Middle Passage" begins
- Thousands imported over the next two decades

#### What People Remember in 2025
**"The Second Middle Passage"** – Toombs's suicidal arrogance

### 1870-1888: The "Toombs Boom" (Bitter Irony)

#### What Happens
- Trade runs full-bore. Thousands imported.
- Boycott crushes CSA economy
- Global cotton glut + raids + boycott + runaway crisis

#### What People Remember in 2025
**The "Toombs Boom"** – bitter irony, the boom that broke the economy

### 1888-1894: The Death in Practice

#### What Happens
- Global cotton glut + raids + boycott + runaway crisis → last states pass **private manumission laws** and **ban new imports**
- Slavery is no longer economically viable
- No new slaves can be born or imported after 1894

#### What People Remember in 2025
**"1894 – The Last Chain Falls"** – the emotional, moral, and practical end. The last child who will ever be born a slave is born this year.

### 1894–1905: The Zombie Years (Probation)

#### Legal Status
- Slavery is still technically legal on paper in a few hold-out states (like OTL Brazil 1888–1898)
- The CSA is on **probation** with the international community

#### Functional Reality
- **Everyone knows it's a corpse**
- No new slaves can be born or imported
- Existing slaves are ageing out
- Raids + debt peonage make it unprofitable
- Convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping have fully replaced it

#### International Status
- **"Most favoured nation" trade restored (barely)**
- What the world actually thinks: **"You're on probation. One slip and the boycott slams shut again."**
- The CSA is the international equivalent of the guy at the party who insists he's been clean for years while everyone watches him like he might pull a flask at any second

#### The Cuba Mirror (1898-1905)
- **1898:** Cuban War photos flood the CSA press. Weyler's camps become the mirror the South cannot un-see.
- **1898-1905:** Cuba's camps are the mirror that finally forces the South to **bury the corpse**
- **No change of heart** – it's pure, cold **shame + self-interest**
- Side-by-side proof: **"This is still us."**
- British papers run them with the caption "The Confederacy's Mirror"
- The CSA elite finally feel **humiliated on the world stage**
- Richmond merchants calculate lost trade from another decade of boycott
- Planters' wives refuse to wear Paris dresses bought with "slave money"

#### What People Remember in 2025
**"The Zombie Years"** – when slavery was legally dead but not yet buried. The probation period.

### 1905: The Coffin Nail

#### Legal Status
- Final constitutional convention strikes every remaining slavery clause
- Full legal abolition + European trade normalisation
- The probation ends, but the scar remains

#### What Forces It
- **1898-1905:** Cuba's camps are the mirror that finally forces the South to bury the corpse
- **1902:** Cuban War ends, photos flood the CSA press
- **1903:** British Foreign Secretary publicly says, "We cannot resume normal relations while the Confederacy clings to the institution that produced Weyler's camps."
- **1904:** "Cuba Reflection" movement sweeps the CSA Congress
- **1905:** Constitutional convention strikes the last legal clauses. The coffin nail is hammered in with the words: **"We will not be Cuba again."**

#### The Reality
- No one in the Confederacy wakes up in 1905 thinking "we were wrong about slavery."
- They wake up thinking: **"The world is laughing at us, our cotton won't sell, and we look like Spain's little brother. Bury it before we all starve."**
- That's not redemption. That's **defeat by mirror**.
- The CSA finally, grudgingly, throws the flask in the trash in front of the whole room.
- No applause. Just the door finally opening to trade.

#### Functional Reality
- **The corpse is finally buried**
- Legal structure finally matches the practical reality that's existed for 11 years
- The ankle monitor is off, but the scar is still there

#### What People Remember in 2025
**"1905 – The Coffin Nail"** – the bureaucratic end. The legal end, 11 years after the real one.

### Key Points

1. **1894** is the real end - emotionally, morally, and practically. This is when slavery actually dies.

2. **1894-1905** is the "Zombie Years" - the legal structure exists but means nothing. Everyone has moved on to convict leasing, debt peonage, and sharecropping.

3. **1905** is just paperwork - the legal structure finally catches up to what everyone already knew.

4. The gap between practical death (1894) and legal death (1905) is 11 years - the "Zombie Years" when the law said one thing but reality said another.

---

## SECTION 2: THE TOOMBS ACT (1867)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The African Labour Restoration Act of 1867  
is the single most self-inflicted wound  
that turns victory into a 25-year economic suicide pact  
and makes 1905 abolition inevitable.

It is stupid, greedy, and perfectly in character for a triumphant, drunk-on-victory Confederacy.

### Full Legal Name

**An Act to Restore to the Citizens of the Confederate States the Full Enjoyment of Their Natural Right to the African Labour Trade, and for Other Purposes**

(Popularly called the **African Labour Restoration Act of 1867** or simply **Toombs Act**)

### Dates

- **Date of passage:** 19 December 1867
- **Signed by President Robert Toombs:** 1 January 1868
- **Effective date:** 1 March 1868

### Specific Provisions (Exact Wording)

| Section | Text (Verbatim) | What It Actually Does |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Section 1** | The prohibition on the importation of persons from Africa contained in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of 1861 is hereby repealed. | Re-opens the Atlantic slave trade with zero restrictions. |
| **Section 2** | Any citizen of the Confederate States may import persons from Africa under the same regulations as other merchandise. | Slaves are legally commodities again. |
| **Section 3** | Duties on imported African labour shall not exceed $25 per head. | Makes it dirt-cheap. |
| **Section 4** | No Confederate state may prohibit or restrict said importation by its own laws. | States' rights die the moment they threaten the trade. |
| **Section 5** | The President is authorised to negotiate treaties with African kingdoms for the orderly supply of labour. | Gives diplomatic cover ("we're buying, not kidnapping"). |

### Who Supports / Opposes (1867 Vote Breakdown)

| Faction | % of Congress | Vote | Motivation |
|---------|---------------|------|------------|
| **Fire-eaters + Deep-South planters** | 58% | YES | "This is why we fought." |
| **Border-state moderates** | 22% | NO | Terrified of British reaction |
| **Merchants & railroad men** | 15% | YES | Cheap labour = cheaper cotton |
| **Longstreet wing + army officers** | 5% | NO | "This will get us boycotted into the stone age." |

**Final vote:** 62% – 38%

(Passes easily once Toombs threatens to veto every appropriations bill until it does.)

### International Reaction (1868)

- **Britain:** Recalls ambassador, imposes total cotton boycott within 60 days.
- **France:** Follows Britain's lead.
- **U.S.:** Raises tariffs to 300%.

**Within 18 months** the CSA economy is bleeding gold faster than the new slaves can pick cotton.

---

## SECTION 3: THE SECOND MIDDLE PASSAGE (1867-1894)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

565,000 souls  
is the exact price the Confederacy pays  
for Robert Toombs's victory speech.

It is the number that finally makes the world say  
"enough"  
and turns 1894–1905 into the coffin-nail years.

### The Numbers

| Period | Annual Average Import | Total Imported (Rounded) | Source / Realism Anchor |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **1867–1874 ("Toombs Boom")** | 35,000–45,000 per year | 320,000 | Peak years – full boycott hasn't bitten yet, planters panic-buying to rebuild war losses |
| **1875–1884 (boycott tightening)** | 15,000–20,000 per year | 170,000 | Prices crash, insurance impossible, but smuggling routes still work |
| **1885–1894 (death spiral)** | 4,000–8,000 per year | 60,000 | Only the most desperate planters; most ships seized or sunk by British patrols |
| **Total 1867–1894** | — | **550,000 – 580,000** | Conservative, locked estimate |

### Locked Total

**≈ 565,000 new Africans forcibly imported into the CSA during the Second Middle Passage.**

### Historical Context

That's:

- **Roughly equal to** the entire illegal U.S. slave trade 1808–1860
- **About 60% of** the legal trans-Atlantic trade to British North America 1619–1808
- **Enough to keep the institution breathing** for one more generation
- **But not enough to save it** from the raids + boycott + runaway haemorrhage

---

## SECTION 4: THE LAST HURRAH RAIDS (1865-1867)

### **PERMANENT LOCK - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The Last Hurrah is organised Northern abolitionist terrorism  
with veteran muscle,  
quietly tolerated for one final burning season,  
then crushed the moment the new governments can move.

No government sanction.  
No spontaneous mobs.  
Just the dying scream of the people who lost the war  
but refused to lose the fight.

That's the ugly, perfect truth.

### Leadership Structure

#### Faction Breakdown

| Faction | Leadership & Character (1865–1867) | Realism Check |
|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Organized Northern cells / underground networks** | The core – abolitionist societies (Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati) that never disbanded after the peace. Funded by Quaker money, Garrison radicals, and secret "John Brown Memorial Funds." | 10/10 |
| **Spontaneous Union veterans** | Join in large numbers, but never lead. They provide muscle and local knowledge, not strategy. | 9/10 |
| **Government-sanctioned** | Never. Lincoln is gone, McClellan is president. The U.S. officially denounces the raiders as criminals. | 0/10 |
| **Secret twist** | The raids are quietly protected by lame-duck Lincoln (March 1865) and early McClellan (April–July 1865) who refuse to use federal troops to stop them while the treaty ink is still wet. | 10/10 |

### Realistic Command Structure (1865–1867)

#### Strategic Leadership
**"The Committee of Nine"** – nine hard-line abolitionists:
- Three ex-Underground Railroad operatives
- Three ex-Kansas jayhawkers
- Three radical clergy

Meeting in secret in Boston and Cincinnati.

#### Field Commanders
Ex-Union cavalry officers (many former prisoners of war with scores to settle) who "resigned" the day the treaty was signed.

#### Troops
Mix of:
- Freedmen who walked out of the CSA
- Union veterans who refused to muster out
- Idealistic college boys from New England

### Key Raids (Locked)

| Date | Name / Leader | Target & Result |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **May 1865** | "The Burning of the Black Belt" (Col. James Montgomery redux) | 27 plantations in Alabama torched in one week |
| **Oct 1865** | "The Great Carolina Ride" (led by ex-Captain Thomas Higginson) | 3,000 slaves liberated, 41 plantations burned |
| **Spring 1866** | "The Arkansas Night" | 19 cotton gins destroyed, 1,200 slaves reach Sequoyah |
| **Winter 1866–67** | Final wave – smaller, more desperate | CSA finally mobilises joint patrols with U.S. marshals |

### End of the Last Hurrah

#### July 1867
Joint U.S.–CSA **"Border Pacification Act"** is signed.

#### 1868–69
Leaders hanged in public trials (Richmond, Washington, and Boston).

#### After 1869
Only local, small-scale copy-cat raids remain.

## SECTION 5: RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Raids burn the crop, never the cradle.

Living quarters off-limits.

That's the rule that survives the joint crackdown  
and lets the legend live on as "righteous" instead of "savage".

### Target Priority and Actions

| Target Priority | Action | Rationale (Realistic & Moral Cover) |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| **Primary – cash crops & infrastructure** | Burn cotton/tobacco/sugar in field or warehouse. Destroy gins, presses, rail depots. | Economic destruction = the whole point |
| **Secondary – workhouses & slave quarters used as punishment** | Torch only when used for convict leasing or brutal discipline. | Symbolic "we free the living, burn the chains" |
| **Off-limits – main houses & family slave quarters** | Never intentionally burned or looted. | Keeps Northern public sympathy and legal deniability |

### Freedpeople

Every raid carries off as many enslaved people as possible, on horseback or wagons.

**Primary moral mission.**

### The Calling Card

Left nailed to the porch of every spared mansion:

**"Your roof stands because your sin is in the fields.  
Next year the fields will be empty.  
Choose."**

### Strict Prohibitions

- **No assassinations.**
- **No house burnings.**
- **No rape, no murder of non-combatants.**

Just fire in the cotton, freedom on the hoof.

---

## SECTION 6: THE JOINT CRACKDOWN (1867-1869)

### **PERMANENT LOCK - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

The joint crackdown is **real military cooperation**  
carried out with **ice-cold mutual hatred**.

It is the first and last time U.S. and CSA soldiers ever fight **together**  
until the Zimmerman Telegram forces them to do it again in 1917.

### The Answer

Yes, they cooperate, but it is the most reluctant, teeth-grinding, temporary marriage in North-American history.

### How It Works

| Feature | How It Actually Works (1867–1869) | Realism Check |
|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Legal basis** | **Border Pacification Act** (July 1867) – identical law passed by both Congresses within 48 hours of each other. | 10/10 |
| **Command structure** | **Joint Border Commission** – 3 U.S. officers, 3 CSA officers, 1 rotating neutral chair (usually a Sequoyah marshal). | 9/10 |
| **Operational reality** | Mixed patrols: one company U.S. cavalry rides **beside** one company CSA cavalry under a white "truce" flag. | 10/10 – happened OTL 1870s against border bandits |
| **Rules of engagement** | Raiders are **shot or hanged on the spot** – no trials, no prisoners. Both sides agree: "dead raiders tell no tales." | 10/10 – exactly how both armies treated guerrillas |
| **Most infamous joint action** | **Battle of the Red River Ford, 12 April 1868** – 400 raiders cornered by 600 joint troopers. 341 raiders killed, 59 captured and hanged the next morning. | 10/10 |
| **Public spin** | U.S. papers: "Law and order restored."<br>CSA papers: "Yankee invaders finally doing something useful." | 10/10 |

### Tone of the Cooperation

- Officers refuse to salute each other.
- Campfires are separate.
- When a U.S. captain and CSA captain have to share a tent during a storm, they sleep with revolvers on their laps.
- The only thing they agree on is that the raiders have to die.

### Result by Spring 1869

- Organised Northern cells are **exterminated**.
- Leaders publicly hanged in joint ceremonies (one in Richmond, one in Washington).
- The continent breathes a sigh of relief and pretends the whole thing never happened.

### Key Details

#### Border Pacification Act (July 1867)
- Identical law passed by both Congresses within 48 hours of each other
- Establishes legal framework for joint operations

#### Joint Border Commission
- 3 U.S. officers
- 3 CSA officers
- 1 rotating neutral chair (usually a Sequoyah marshal)

#### Battle of the Red River Ford (12 April 1868)
- 400 raiders cornered by 600 joint troopers
- 341 raiders killed
- 59 captured and hanged the next morning
- Most infamous joint action

#### Public Executions
- Leaders publicly hanged in joint ceremonies
- One ceremony in Richmond
- One ceremony in Washington

---

## SECTION 7: HOLD-OUT STATES (1905)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

There are no true state hold-outs after 1905.

Mississippi tried to be the last rebel  
and got publicly spanked by its own Supreme Court  
for the crime of making the rest of the country look bad.

1894 = the last slave child is born.

1905 = the last legal fiction is finally buried.

Mississippi's Perpetual Slavery Act is the dying scream of the fire-eaters  
and the birth certificate of Confederate Jim Crow.

### The Answer

The entire Confederacy is the hold-out until 1905, with one spectacular exception that gets slapped down hard.

### The Timeline

| Year | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **1867–1894** | Slavery is legal nationwide under the Toombs Act (national constitutional amendment). |
| **1892** | Mississippi, in a final act of fire-eater defiance, passes the **Perpetual Slavery Act**, declaring slavery permanent and irrevocable in Mississippi, even against future Confederate amendments. |
| **1894** | Slavery becomes functionally dead (no new imports, no new slave births, raids + boycott have killed it). **"The Last Chain Falls"** – the emotional, moral, and practical end. |
| **1894** | Mississippi Supreme Court "clarifies" the Act in the most humiliating way possible: **"The Perpetual Slavery Act shall apply only as punishment for crime…"** (Instantly turns Mississippi slavery into convict leasing while keeping the original law technically on the books.) |
| **1905** | National convention repeals the Toombs amendment → slavery is legally abolished everywhere. The Mississippi Act dies with it (the clarification already gutted it). |

### Mississippi's Perpetual Slavery Act (1892)

#### The Act
Mississippi, in a final act of fire-eater defiance, passes the **Perpetual Slavery Act**, declaring slavery permanent and irrevocable in Mississippi, even against future Confederate amendments.

#### The Supreme Court Clarification (1894)
Mississippi Supreme Court "clarifies" the Act in the most humiliating way possible:

**"The Perpetual Slavery Act shall apply only as punishment for crime…"**

This instantly turns Mississippi slavery into convict leasing while keeping the original law technically on the books.

## SECTION 8: NIGHT RIDERS & FORREST (1875-1877)

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING - NOT LOCKED

### The Night Riders (1875-1877)

#### What They Are
The Klan analogue in your NTL (New Timeline). Called the Night Riders, the Torch Watch, or the Regulators (name flexible).

#### When They Rise
**1875-1877** - The desperate, vicious response of the hardest-line planters and ex-soldiers who refuse to accept that the raids have made slavery unprofitable.

#### Why They Form
- Economic desperation
- Widespread armament
- Ready-made mythology of "Yankee invasion and negro betrayal"
- Refusal to accept that slavery is dying

#### Nathan Bedford Forrest's Role
- Becomes the charismatic, terrifying face of the movement for two brutal years
- Leads the organization during its peak

### Forrest's Death (Summer 1877)

#### The Scene
**Summer 1877:** Nathan Bedford Forrest dies bleeding out under a cypress tree, shot by the very "Yankee ghosts" and Black defenders he swore to exterminate.

#### The Result
The organization splinters immediately:
- Some cells keep riding for another season or two, but without Forrest's name and reputation they're just scattered bushwhackers
- Joint USA–CSA "anti-bandit" posses (ironically using the same tactics the raiders pioneered) hunt them down by 1880
- By 1885 the Night Riders are a ghost story told to scare children: "Be good or the Regulators will get you… except they're all dead now."

### The Moral Victory

#### What You Get
1. The Klan is born (as Night Riders)
2. Everyone sees exactly what it is
3. It dies ugly, early, and with its founder in the dirt
4. It never gets the chance to:
   - Cloak itself in sheets
   - Invent a romantic mythology
   - Terrorize generations

#### In the 2025 CSA
The word "Klan" is just a footnote in high-school textbooks:
> "A short-lived terrorist movement (1875–1879) crushed during the final phase of the Raider War."

**No parades. No statues. No legacy.**  
Just a cautionary tale about what happens when you let pride and terror write the next chapter.

### The Academic Footnote (1985)

#### In Dr. General Fairfax-Lockwood's Paper
A single paragraph that becomes the darkest, most chilling footnote:

> Had General Forrest survived his 1877 encounter on the Hatchie River, or had the Night Rider cells persisted another five years under unified leadership, it is not difficult to imagine the movement metastasizing into a permanent, quasi-official apparatus of racial terror across the lower Confederacy. The combination of economic desperation, widespread armament, and a ready-made mythology of "Yankee invasion and negro betrayal" provided fertile soil for precisely the sort of hooded, nocturnal order that plagued the United States in our own history under a different name. That it was extinguished in its infancy owes less to moral enlightenment than to the fortunate coincidence of a bullet and the rapid collapse of the institution the Riders were formed to protect. Future historians would do well to remember that monsters are not born immortal; they are merely allowed to live.

## SECTION 9: RACISM IN THE ALTERNATE TIMELINE

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING - NOT LOCKED

### Core Principle

**Racism would endure** – it's too deeply woven into human nature, economic structures, and cultural habits to "burn out" completely, even without the KKK's organized horror.

### Southern Racism (CSA)

#### As Institutional Habit
- The CSA's victory cements white supremacy as a founding principle
- The 1861 Constitution's slavery protections linger in spirit
- Even after emancipation, laws like vagrancy codes, poll taxes, and segregated labor keep Blacks as second-class citizens

#### By 2025
- **Less overt** (no lynch mobs in the streets)
- **But systemic:**
  - Higher Black incarceration (convict leasing never fully dies)
  - Wage gaps in oil/tech jobs
  - Cultural taboos on interracial mixing

#### The "Siege Mentality" Factor
- Raids create a "siege mentality" blaming Blacks as "raider accomplices"
- Victory hardens attitudes ("We proved our way works")
- **Overall:** Probably 60-70% chance it's worse in the South than OTL

#### But the Gap Narrows Faster
- Economic interdependence with the USA forces reforms
- Native states provide models of sovereignty without hierarchy
- By 2025, CSA race relations "burn out" to our real 1990s level

### Northern Racism (USA)

#### As Complacent Superiority
- The USA pats itself on the back for "ending" slavery via raids
- But its own racism (de facto segregation in cities, anti-immigrant nativism) festers unchecked
- Without the South as an "anchor" for national guilt, Northern whites feel less compelled to confront it

#### By 2025
- **Subtler** (algorithmic bias, housing redlining)
- **But no less real**
- Think modern Europe's "we're post-racial" vibe masking subtle biases

### Without KKK Terror: More Black "Spine" and Less White Guilt Reliance

#### Black Assertiveness Grows Earlier
**Without the KKK's lynching peak (1868-1920s OTL), violence is localized:**
- Raids spark reprisals, but no national terror network
- This creates breathing room

**Freed from KKK's shadow, Black Southerners:**
- Arm up (from anti-raider patrols)
- Migrate to cities
- Build institutions (churches, unions, mutual-aid societies) faster

**By 1920s:**
- Bolder figures: Black CSA congressmen demanding wages
- WWII veterans refusing segregated buses
- Less terror means more "spine"
- Think real OTL Tulsa/Black Wall Street energy, but scaled up without the 1921 massacre equivalent

**Black Assertiveness:**
- Southern Blacks assert equality through economic power (oil jobs, certified farms)
- Rather than white guilt appeals

#### Less Reliance on White Guilt
**Without OTL Reconstruction's "forced equality" backlash:**
- White guilt is weaker
- Southern whites see emancipation as "our pragmatic choice," not Yankee imposition

**Blacks "level balances" via leverage:**
- "Pay us fair or watch your fields burn"
- By 2025, tensions exist, but Blacks wield more independent power:
  - Stronger voting blocs
  - Business ownership
  - Without begging for white benevolence

### The "Burn-Out" Process

#### How It Happens
**Racism doesn't vanish, but it "burns out" to a more manageable level:**
- Less violent (no KKK terror)
- More economic (systemic inequality, not lynch mobs)
- More localized (regional tensions, not national terror)

#### The Timeline
- **1865-1894:** Racism is violent and systemic (slavery, raids, reprisals)
- **1894-1905:** "Zombie Years" - legal slavery dies, but racism persists
- **1905-1920:** Racism becomes more economic/systemic, less violent
- **1920-1945:** Racism "burns out" to 1990s OTL level
- **By 2025:** Tensions exist, but Blacks have more independent power

### The Key Distinction

#### What Changes
- **No KKK terror** - no national lynching campaign
- **More Black assertiveness** - economic power, not white guilt
- **Less violent racism** - more systemic/economic

#### What Doesn't Change
- **Racism persists** - it's too deeply woven in
- **Systemic inequality** - still exists, just in different forms
- **Cultural biases** - still present, just less overt

#### The Result
**By 2025:**
- Racism is alive and well, but "burned out" to a more manageable level
- Less violent, more economic
- Blacks have more independent power
- But still fighting for full equality

**Last Updated:** December 5, 2025
