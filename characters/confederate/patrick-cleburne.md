## Personality

### Core Traits
1. **Pragmatic and Analytical** - Thinks like a soldier solving problems, not an ideologue
2. **Stubborn and Defiant** - Once convinced he's right, refuses to back down
3. **Intelligent and Forward-Thinking** - Sees economic and military realities others ignore
4. **Bitter but Not Broken** - Cashiering wounds him deeply, but he channels it into witness and documentation
5. **Irish Immigrant Pride** - Proud of his adopted country but never fully accepted by Southern society

### Strengths
- **Military Tactics** - Excellent division commander, tactical innovator
- **Strategic Thinking** - Sees beyond immediate battles to long-term consequences
- **Documentation** - Meticulous record-keeper, becomes primary source for slavery's economic death
- **Moral Courage** - Willing to speak truth to power, even at personal cost
- **Persistence** - Refuses to disappear after cashiering, stays to witness and document

### Weaknesses
- **Political Naivety** - Doesn't understand that military logic doesn't always translate to political reality
- **Stubbornness** - Once convinced he's right, refuses to compromise or back down
- **Lack of Southern Roots** - Irish immigrant status makes him vulnerable to dismissal as "not understanding Southern society"
- **Bitter Vindication** - Lives long enough to see he was right, but vindication doesn't erase the cost
- **Isolation** - After cashiering, becomes isolated from military and political circles

### Fears
- Being forgotten or dismissed as a "defeatist"
- Dying before seeing vindication
- That his proposal was right but came too late to matter
- That history will remember him only as the cashiered general, not the prophet who was right

### Desires
- To be proven right about slavery's economic unsustainability
- To see his proposal vindicated by history
- To document the truth for future generations
- To be remembered as someone who told the truth, even when it cost him everything

### Quirks
- Maintains military bearing even as civilian

- Watches events unfold from border area, documenting everything

## Background

### Early Life
- Born in County Cork, Ireland (1828)
- Emigrated to United States (1849) - arrived in Arkansas
- Worked as druggist/clerk before war
- Naturalized citizen, adopted Arkansas as home

### Pre-War Career
- Worked in Helena, Arkansas
- Joined local militia
- No formal military training, but natural military talent
- Rose through ranks based on ability, not connections

### Civil War (OTL)
- **Early Service:** Shiloh (April 1862) - earned "Stonewall of the West" nickname
- **Stones River (Dec 1862-Jan 1863):** Excellent defensive performance
- **Chickamauga (Sept 1863):** Led division in successful assault
- **January 1864:** Circulated memorandum proposing freeing and arming slaves
- **1864:** Proposal suppressed by Davis, Cleburne essentially blacklisted
- **Franklin (Nov 1864):** Killed leading division in desperate assault

### NTL Divergence (February 1864)
- **The Proposal:** Same as OTL - proposes freeing/arming slaves for military advantage (January 1864)
- **The Cashiering:** Davis cashiers Cleburne (February 28, 1864) for "conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline"
- **The Reason:** Political calculation - proposal threatens economic/political coalition, Davis chooses political stability over military talent
- **The Consequence:** Cleburne never serves in ANV, never dies at Franklin, becomes civilian activist and witness
- **The Vindication:** Lives to see slavery's practical end (1894) and legal abolition (1905), dies vindicated but bitter

## Skills & Abilities

## Voice & Dialogue

### Speech Patterns

- **Prophetic** - Speaks with certainty about future consequences

### Vocabulary
- Military terminology (pre-cashiering)
- Economic and political analysis (post-cashiering)
- Uses "I told you so" but documented, not bitter
- References to "economic reality" and "strategic necessity"

### Sample Dialogue
- "I proposed we end slavery on our terms, for our benefit, at a time of our choosing. I was told this was defeatism." (1867 article)
- "Thirty years. I said it would happen. It happened." (1894)
- "I was right. It cost me everything, but I was right." (deathbed)
- "The President cashiers men for threatening political stability. Whether you threatened it intentionally or accidentally is irrelevant." (War Department clerk, 1864)

## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not Just a Martyr** - Has real military skill, not just prophetic vision
- **Not a Moral Abolitionist** - Proposes freeing slaves for military advantage, not moral principle
- **Not Perfect** - Political naivety, stubbornness, bitterness are real flaws
- **Not a Hero** - Right about economics, but proposal would have been economically catastrophic in 1864

### Key Contradictions
- **Pragmatic but Naive** - Sees economic reality but doesn't understand political necessity
- **Right but Too Early** - Correct about slavery's death, but timing makes proposal impossible
- **Military Logic vs. Political Reality** - Solves military problem but threatens political coalition
- **Vindicated but Bitter** - Lives to see he was right, but vindication doesn't erase the cost

### Writing Tips
- Show his analytical mind through careful, logical arguments
- Contrast his pragmatic proposal with Davis's political calculation
- Use cashiering as character-defining moment - the moment he becomes witness
- Show his isolation after cashiering, but also his persistence
- Let his vindication be bittersweet - right but too late to matter
- Use his Irish accent and immigrant status to show he's never fully accepted

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No standout film portrayal** - Cleburne rarely appears in Civil War films, though he's mentioned in some documentaries.

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Cleburne | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Liam Neeson** | 1990-2025 (*Schindler's List*, *Taken*) | Neeson's Irish accent, intensity, and ability to play characters who speak truth to power would capture Cleburne's stubborn integrity and bitter vindication. His ability to show controlled anger beneath analytical calm is perfect. | Receiving the cashiering order - Neeson's Cleburne, reading the order, the slow realization, the controlled anger, the determination to prove he was right. |
| **Ciaran Hinds** | 2000-2025 (*Rome*, *Game of Thrones*) | Hinds's Irish intensity and ability to play characters who are right but marginalized would capture Cleburne's analytical mind and bitter persistence. His ability to show intelligence and determination beneath quiet exterior is perfect. | The 1867 article - Hinds's Cleburne, writing with controlled anger, documenting the vindication he knows is coming, the analytical precision masking deep bitterness. |
| **Colin Farrell** | 2000-2025 (*In Bruges*, *The Banshees of Inisherin*) | Farrell's Irish intensity and ability to play characters who are right but punished for it would capture Cleburne's stubborn defiance and bitter vindication. His ability to show vulnerability beneath toughness is perfect. | The 1894 vindication - Farrell's Cleburne, reading the news, the slow satisfaction mixed with bitterness, "I was right. It cost me everything, but I was right." |
| **Michael Fassbender** | 2005-2025 (*12 Years a Slave*, *Steve Jobs*) | Fassbender's intensity and ability to play characters who are right but isolated would capture Cleburne's analytical mind and bitter persistence. His ability to show controlled anger and determination is perfect. | The deathbed scene - Fassbender's Cleburne, elderly and dying, speaking with final certainty, "I was right. It cost me everything, but I was right." |
| **Brendan Gleeson** | 1990-2025 (*In Bruges*, *The Banshees of Inisherin*) | Gleeson's Irish gravitas and ability to play characters who speak truth to power would capture Cleburne's stubborn integrity and bitter vindication. His ability to show intelligence and determination beneath quiet exterior is perfect. | The War Department scene - Gleeson's Cleburne, trying to understand why he was cashiered, the clerk's explanation, the slow realization, the determination to prove he was right. |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, Cleburne survives the war and lives to see his vindication
- **The cashiering:** Davis's cold political calculation, not military judgment
- **The vindication:** Lives to see slavery's practical end (1894) and legal abolition (1905)
- **The tragedy:** Right about everything, but vindication comes too late to matter
- **Physical presence:** Irish immigrant, never fully accepted, but maintains military bearing and analytical mind

---

**Status:** HISTORICAL FIGURE - ADAPTED FOR NTL  
**Plausibility:** 90-92% (cashiering) - 88% (living to 1905)  
**Source:** OTL historical record (Patrick Cleburne was real person), adapted for NTL divergence  
**Note:** In NTL, Cleburne is cashiered (not just suppressed) and survives the war to become the "martyred prophet" who documents slavery's economic death. He lives to see his 1864 proposal vindicated by history, but vindication comes too late to save his career or change the course of events.
