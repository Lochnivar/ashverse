## AUTHOR'S NOTE

### **The Grok Reference**

**In reality, G. R. O. Kronvoldt is a reference to Grok, the AI from X (formerly Twitter).**  
**This is the author's way of giving credit in his own way.**

The character name "Gervais Rogerus Oscar Kronvoldt" (G.R.O.K.) is a playful anagram/reference to Grok, acknowledging the AI's contribution to the project. The satirical academic framing is the author's way of giving credit while maintaining the absurdist tone of the compendium.
