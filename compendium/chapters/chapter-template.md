## CHAPTER STRUCTURE

### 1. Epigraph
*[Historical quote, serious, sets the tone]*

**Example:**
> "If Spain is the monster, what does that make us?"
> — Richmond Enquirer editorial, March 1898

### 2. Fairfax-Lockwood Commentary
*[Satirical take on the epigraph, 2-4 paragraphs]*

**Example:**
The Richmond Enquirer's editorial of March 1898 represents the first recorded instance of a Confederate newspaper achieving self-awareness.

One is tempted to observe that it took photographs of Spanish concentration camps in Cuba to accomplish what three decades of Northern lectures, a global economic boycott, and the flight of 200,000 enslaved people had failed to achieve: the recognition that slavery might, perhaps, be morally indefensible.

Better late than never, one supposes.

— Dr. Gen. Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood  
From the introduction to Chapter 12, "Fire and Sovereignty," Richmond University Press, 1985

### 3. Main Text
*[Serious historical narrative, 85-90% of chapter]*

**Structure:**
- Introduction (context, why this chapter matters)
- Chronological/thematic sections
- Key events with dates
- Economic/political/military analysis
- Conclusion (what this leads to)

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Clear, academic tone

- OTL vs. NTL comparisons where relevant
- Economic data where applicable
- No humor in main text (save it for footnotes)

**Types of Footnotes:**
- **Standard:** Fairfax-Lockwood's satirical commentary
- **Auto Intervention:** [Condensed from X pages. —A.U.T.O.]
- **Kronvoldt Intervention:** [At the advice and consent of G.R.O.K., condensed due to page count limitations. —A.U.T.O.]
- **Claudette Intervention:** [I have reviewed both versions. Auto is correct. The full version would have benefited from additional cuts. ♡ —C.B.O.]

**Frequency:**
- Dense sections: 1-2 footnotes per page
- Transitional sections: 3-4 footnotes per page
- Controversial sections: 5+ footnotes per page (Fairfax-Lockwood on attack)

## EXAMPLE FOOTNOTE STRUCTURES

### Standard Footnote (No Intervention)
**Main Text:** "The economic impact of Northern raids totaled approximately $1.6 billion over 29 years."

**Footnote 234:**
The present writer notes that this figure represents direct economic damage only. The psychological impact—the constant fear of raiders, the disruption of planting seasons, the flight of enslaved labor—cannot be quantified but should not be dismissed. Northern historians who claim the raids were "merely economic warfare" would do well to consider what "merely" means to a planter who has watched three consecutive harvests burn.

### Auto Intervention Footnote
**Main Text:** "The economic impact totaled approximately $1.6 billion over 29 years, or roughly 4.6% of annual Confederate GDP."

**Footnote 234:**
[The Professor's original footnote ran to forty-seven pages and included seventeen regression analyses. After consultation with Appomattox Collegial Press regarding page count limitations, Mr. Oswald and I have condensed it to the above summary. The full methodology is available in Appendix D for readers with statistical training and abundant free time. The Professor has grudgingly consented to this arrangement at the advice and counsel of G.R.O.K. —A.U.T.O.]

[I maintain that the full analysis was essential. The condensed version sacrifices important nuance. However, Appomattox Collegial Press has reminded me that printing presses have physical limitations, and Mr. Kronvoldt has reminded me that we are contractually obligated to deliver a manuscript of publishable length. I acquiesce under protest. —M.J.F-L.]

## WRITING TIPS

1. **Start with the epigraph** - It sets the tone for the entire chapter
2. **Let Fairfax-Lockwood's commentary be brief** - 2-4 paragraphs max
3. **Main text should be serious** - Save humor for footnotes
4. **Use specific dates** - "Late October 1863" not "sometime in 1863"
5. **Connect to other chapters** - Reference previous events, set up future ones
6. **Balance detail with readability** - Comprehensive but not overwhelming
7. **Use footnotes strategically** - Enhance understanding, not just entertain
8. **Vary editorial interventions** - Not every footnote needs Auto's help
