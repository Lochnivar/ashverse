## THE STRATEGIC SITUATION (March 1865)

### Grant's Position

**Time Pressure:**
- McClellan elected November 1864, takes office March 4, 1865
- Peace negotiations will begin within weeks
- Grant has one last chance to salvage the war

**Northern Desperation:**
- Food riots in New York, Boston, Chicago
- Draft resistance collapsing
- Copperhead victories in mid-terms
- Pickett's Raid (June 1864) still fresh in memory
- Hancock wounded (July 1864) - last Northern hero fallen

**Grant's Decision:**
- Abandon methodical Overland Campaign approach
- Assemble every available unit (Western armies, garrisons, everything)
- Launch one massive, all-or-nothing strike at Richmond
- No feints, no diversions, no second chances

### Longstreet's Position

**Defensive Master:**
- Longstreet has spent 1864-1865 fortifying Richmond approaches
- Rapidan-Rappahannock line is a killing ground
- Supply lines intact, army well-fed and positioned
- Knows Grant is desperate - expects the gamble

**Strategic Advantage:**
- Interior lines (can shift forces quickly)
- Prepared positions (every ford, ridge, crossroads)
- Cavalry superiority (Fitzhugh Lee, Hampton, Rosser)
- Time is on his side (just need to hold until peace talks)
