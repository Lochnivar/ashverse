## LOCKED ASSUMPTIONS

- **Meade sacked August 1, 1863** for "want of aggression" after failing to trap Longstreet
- **Warren appointed August 3, 1863** - young (33), aggressive, politically clean (engineer, topographical corps veteran)
- **Union Army of the Potomac:** ~110,000 men after reorganization, but exhausted, mutinous, full of green bounty men
- **Confederate Army of Northern Virginia:** ~55,000 men under Longstreet, dug in on Rappahannock-Rapidan line, rested and resupplied from Pennsylvania raids
- **Political Pressure:** Lincoln/Stanton demand a fall offensive "to erase the stigma of 1863" - Warren has no choice but to attack
- **Outcome:** Disastrous "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder" (October 10-23, 1863) - three separate killing grounds, ~45,600 Union losses, ~13,260 Confederate losses (3.4:1 ratio)
- **Warren relieved January 1, 1864** after the disaster; Hancock takes command January 3, 1864

### HISTORICAL BASIS: THE THREE-MONTH FORTIFICATION PERIOD

**OTL Historical Precedent (May 1863):**

In the Original Timeline, General Lee issued explicit written orders in May 1863 for the Rappahannock-Rapidan line to be fortified in case the army was forced to retire from Pennsylvania:

- **15 May 1863** - Lee to Secretary of War Seddon (*OR*, Series I, Vol. 25, Part 2, p. 802):
  > "I have for some time been aware that the enemy might attempt to turn our left flank… I have therefore directed General D. H. Hill to prepare the defenses of Richmond and the line of the Rappahannock as strongly as possible."

- **20 May 1863** - Lee to President Davis (*OR*, Series I, Vol. 25, Part 2, p. 809):
  > "I have instructed General Hill to fortify the line of the Rappahannock from Fredericksburg to the mountains, so that if we are compelled to fall back we will have a strong position to retire upon."

**NTL Difference:**

In the Original Timeline, these orders were partially executed and then abandoned when Lee returned south after Gettysburg. In the New Timeline, General Lee's untimely death on July 1, 1863 ensured the orders were never countermanded. D.H. Hill's detachment (12-15,000 men) continued fortifying the line throughout July-October 1863 while Longstreet conducted the Pennsylvania raid. The line was therefore waiting, ready and complete, when General Longstreet returned from his Pennsylvania expedition in late October 1863.

**Locked Canon Statement:**

> General Lee, in May 1863, issued explicit written orders for the Rappahannock-Rapidan line to be fortified in case the army was forced to retire from Pennsylvania.  
>  
> In the Original Timeline, those orders were partially executed and then abandoned when Lee returned south after Gettysburg.  
>  
> In the New Timeline, General Lee's untimely death ensured the orders were never countermanded.  
>  
> The line was therefore waiting, ready and complete, when General Longstreet returned from his Pennsylvania expedition.  
>  
> One is almost tempted to call it Providence.  
>  
> "Insurance" comes rather closer.

## COMPLETE CHRONOLOGICAL TIMELINE

### AUGUST 1863: MEADE SACKED, WARREN APPOINTED

**August 1, 1863**

- **Washington:** Lincoln summons Meade, Halleck, Stanton, and the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War to the White House.
- **Outcome:** Meade scapegoated for the 36-hour freeze and failure to trap Longstreet. Relieved "for want of aggression."
- **Meade's Reaction:** Bitter resignation. Private letter to wife: "They needed a scapegoat, and I was the one who let him get away."

**August 3, 1863**

- **Washington:** Gouverneur K. Warren appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac.
- **Written Orders from Lincoln:** "Restore the offensive spirit of the army or we lose the war this winter."
- **Warren's Profile:** 33 years old, aggressive engineer, topographical corps veteran, politically clean (no Copperhead ties).
- **Initial Actions:** Warren arrives at army HQ near Warrenton, VA. Begins immediate reorganization: purges "Meade conservatives," promotes aggressive officers, brings up new regiments from Washington defenses.

**August 4–15, 1863**

- **Union:** Frantic rebuilding. Army swells to ~110,000 with fresh troops, but quality mixed (many bounty men, short-term enlistees). Warren drills relentlessly, focusing on rapid maneuvers and offensive spirit.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet fortifies every ford and ridge from Fredericksburg to Gordonsville. Army rests, refits from Pennsylvania spoils.

**August 16–31, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren probes Longstreet's lines with cavalry raids (Hampton/Fitzhugh Lee repulse them). Warren's scouts report: "The Rebs are dug in like ticks." Warren delays major action, citing need for more artillery.
- **Washington:** Stanton wires Warren: "The President expects results before the leaves fall."
- **Confederate:** Longstreet launches small counter-raids to keep Union off-balance.

---

### SEPTEMBER 1863: THE PROBING PHASE

**September 1–15, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren conducts limited offensives across the Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford and Culpeper Court House. Minor gains, but Longstreet's defenses hold. Union losses: ~3,000.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet cedes outer positions but bleeds Warren at every river crossing.

**September 16–30, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren pushes to the Rapidan line. Probes at Raccoon Ford and Somerville Ford. Longstreet's fortifications prove impregnable. Union losses mount to ~5,000 in skirmishes.
- **Washington:** Lincoln to Stanton: "Warren must attack before winter. The country demands it."

---

### OCTOBER 1863: THE "FOURTEEN DAYS' MEAT-GRINDER"

**October 10, 1863 – Campaign Begins**

- **Union:** Warren launches full offensive in three columns:
  - Left: I/II Corps cross Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford
  - Center: V/VI Corps at Culpeper
  - Right: III/XI Corps at Germanna Ford
- **Confederate:** Longstreet anticipates; has pre-dug positions at every crossing.

**October 10–12: The Rappahannock Killing Ground**

- **Union:** Left column smashed at Kelly's Ford (Marye's Heights-style defense). ~20,600 casualties.
- **Confederate:** Ewell's corps holds with ~5,010 losses.

**October 14–17: The Rapidan Killing Ground**

- **Union:** Center column bled out at Culpeper (North Anna-style entrenchments). ~15,200 casualties.
- **Confederate:** Hill's corps repulses attacks (~4,770 loss).

**October 18–23: The Occoquan Killing Ground**

- **Union:** Right column shattered at Germanna Ford (combined artillery/crossfire slaughter). ~9,800 casualties.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet's reserve crushes final push (~3,480 loss).

**Total Union Losses:** ~45,600 in 14 days (the "Meat-Grinder")  
**Confederate Losses:** ~13,260  
**Casualty Ratio:** 3.4:1 in favor of defense

**Outcome:** Warren's army staggers back north a "bloody stump." Northern newspapers coin "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder." Morale collapses.

**October 24–31, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren digs in north of the Occoquan. Mutinies in three regiments. Desertions skyrocket.
- **Washington:** Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War begins investigation. Stanton to Lincoln: "The army is broken."

---

### NOVEMBER 1863: AFTERMATH AND INQUIRY

**November 1–30, 1863**

- **Union:** Warren digs in north of the Occoquan. Mutinies continue. Desertions reach epidemic levels. Congressional inquiry begins.
- **Washington:** Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War investigates the disaster. Warren's command under scrutiny.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet fortifies winter lines. Army rests, morale high.

---

### DECEMBER 1863: THE WINTER OF DESPAIR

**December 1–31, 1863**

- **Union:** Morale collapses. Desertions reach epidemic levels. Copperhead papers declare "the war is lost." Midterm elections swing heavily anti-war. Peace talks whispers begin.
- **Confederate:** Longstreet launches small winter raids to keep pressure on. Army winters fat in Culpeper/Orange Counties.
- **Washington:** Lincoln to Stanton: "We have lost the year. God help us in 1864."

---

### JANUARY 1864: THE SACKING

**January 1, 1864**

- **Washington:** Lincoln issues a 1,400-word public letter "after mature consideration of all relevant reports and testimonies" relieving Warren "with regret" and praising his "distinguished service as an engineer and topographical officer."
- **Official Order:** "Relieved for want of results and loss of offensive spirit."
- **Reality (locked behind closed doors):**
  - Stanton had the relief order drafted on October 24
  - The Joint Committee voted to sack Warren on November 12
  - Lincoln sat on it for nine weeks so it wouldn't look like panic
  - Every Northern editor knew Warren was already dead the moment the army limped north of the Occoquan

**January 2, 1864**

- **Washington:** Lincoln's letter released to the press. Northern newspapers respond with scathing headlines (see "The Mature Consideration Farce" below).

**January 3, 1864**

- **Washington:** Winfield Scott Hancock appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac (after brief consideration of John Reynolds - but he's dead at Gettysburg).
- **Hancock's Orders:** "Rebuild the army's morale and effectiveness. The war depends on it."
- **Union:** Hancock begins reorganization. Army remains in winter quarters north of the Occoquan.

## KEY NOTES

- **Warren's Command:** August 3, 1863 – January 1, 1864 (151 days)
- **Hancock's Command:** Begins January 3, 1864
- **The "Meat-Grinder":** Three separate killing grounds (Rappahannock, Rapidan, Occoquan) — not one continuous battle
- **Why Warren Fails:** Political pressure forces attack; Longstreet has 3 months to fortify (D.H. Hill's detachment continues Lee's May 1863 orders while Longstreet is in Pennsylvania); Union army exhausted/mutinous
- **Strategic Impact:** Union morale shattered; Copperheads gain power; path to McClellan's election cleared

**Status:** Canon-Locked

**Next:** Hancock's command (January 1864) → Pickett's Lightning Raid (June-July 1864)

### Reality (Locked Behind Closed Doors)

- Stanton had the relief order drafted on October 24.
- The Joint Committee voted to sack Warren on November 12.
- Lincoln sat on it for nine weeks so it wouldn't look like panic.
- Every Northern editor knew Warren was already dead the moment the army limped north of the Occoquan.

### Northern Newspaper Headlines (January 2-4, 1864)

| Paper                  | Headline                                      | Tone |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------|
| New York Herald        | "WARREN RELIEVED AFTER MATURE CONSIDERATION" | Dripping sarcasm |
| Chicago Tribune        | "Nine Weeks to Discover What Every Soldier Knew in October" | Fury |
| New York World (Copperhead) | "Lincoln Finally Admits His War Is Lost"      | Gloating |
| Harper's Weekly        | Cartoon: Lincoln as a tortoise labelled "Mature Consideration" carrying Warren's severed head | Savage |

### Fairfax-Lockwood's Footnote (1985)

> "President Lincoln's letter of 1 January 1864 relieving General Warren is a masterpiece of bureaucratic procrastination. One is almost tempted to admire the artistry with which nine weeks of political necessity were disguised as solemn deliberation. Almost."

**Locked.**  
The farce is now canon.  
And still not apologising.
