| **1902-1908** | James K. Vardaman | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The White Chief" | Fiery populist high-water mark | **87%** | **LOCKED** | Real person, OTL Mississippi governor, populist, age 44 in 1902, "White Chief" nickname fits, perfect Hayseed |
| **1908-1914** | Hoke Smith | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The Georgia Cyclone" | Peak Hayseed power | **86%** | **LOCKED** | Real person, OTL Georgia governor, populist, age 52 in 1908, "Georgia Cyclone" fits, peak Hayseed era |

**OTL Role:** Moderate, pro-peace, planter class  
**NTL Fit:** Perfect - first post-war president, moderate voice, Gentry dominance  
**Legacy:** "Dies in office 1871; last moderate voice" - OTL Stephens died 1883, but early death plausible  
**Plausibility:** 88% - Real person, perfect age, perfect fit, early death plausible

**Concerns:**
- OTL Stephens died 1883 (age 71), not 1871 - but early death plausible (health issues, stress)
- Moderate voice fits post-war transition

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Strong fit, plausible early death

---

### 2. Robert M. T. Hunter (1871-1872) - (caretaker) - 85%

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL CSA Secretary of State (1861-1862)  
**Age in 1871:** 63 (born 1809)

**Legacy:** "Finishes term quietly" - caretaker role makes sense  
**Plausibility:** 85% - Real person, age appropriate, caretaker role plausible

**Concerns:**
- OTL Hunter died 1887 (age 78), so 1871-1872 is plausible
- Caretaker role fits VP ascension scenario

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Strong fit, plausible caretaker role

---

### 3. Robert Toombs (1867-1871) - "The Old Lion" - 92%

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL Confederate general, fire-eater  
**Age in 1872:** 62 (born 1810)  
**OTL Role:** Fire-eater, pro-slavery, re-opens African trade  
**NTL Fit:** Perfect - already locked in canon, Toombs Act timeline matches  
**Legacy:** "Toombs Act → boycott → leaves hated" - matches canon  
**Plausibility:** 92% - Already locked in canon, real person, perfect fit

**Concerns:**
- None - already established in canon

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Already canon, perfect fit

---

### 4. John C. Breckinridge (1878-1884) - "The Cleanup Man" - 88%

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL CSA Secretary of War (1865), VP under Buchanan (1857-1861)  
**Age in 1878:** 57 (born 1821)  
**OTL Role:** Moderate, pro-compromise, planter class  
**NTL Fit:** Good - "cleanup" role after Toombs disaster, moderate voice  
**Legacy:** "Tries to fix Toombs mess; fails" - plausible cleanup attempt  
**Plausibility:** 88% - Real person, age appropriate, cleanup role makes sense, longer life justified

**OTL Death:** 17 May 1875 (age 54)  
**NTL Death:** Still alive 1884 (age 63) → dies ~1888 (age 67)  
**Age Difference:** +13 years  
**Justification:** No heroic medicine required. OTL death was likely stress-related (post-war exile, financial hardship). NTL different circumstances (respected Confederate leader, better healthcare, no exile) → natural extension of life.

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Strong fit, longer life well-justified

---

### 5. James L. Kemper (1884-1890) - "The Railroad Gentleman" - 81%

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL Virginia governor (1874-1878), Confederate general  
**Age in 1884:** 60 (born 1823)  
**OTL Role:** Moderate, pro-industrialization, planter class  
**NTL Fit:** Good - "railroad gentleman" fits Gentry industrial interests  
**Legacy:** "First big industrial push" - aligns with Gentry industrial era  
**Plausibility:** 81% - Real person, age appropriate, industrial focus fits

**Concerns:**
- OTL Kemper died 1895 (age 72), so 1884-1890 is plausible
- "Railroad gentleman" fits Gentry industrial interests

**Verdict:** **GREEN FLAG** - Strong fit, plausible industrial focus

---

### 6. Benjamin H. Hill (1890-1896) - "The Silent" / "The Last Planter" - 85%

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL Confederate senator, moderate  
**Age in 1890:** 64 (born 1823)  
**OTL Role:** Moderate, pro-compromise, planter class  
**NTL Fit:** Good - "last planter" fits end of Gentry dominance, slavery's functional death (1894)  
**Legacy:** "Oversees slavery's functional death (1894); tongue cancer caught early, amputated after election" - aligns with timeline  
**Plausibility:** 85% - Real person, age appropriate, "last planter" narrative fits, longer life well-justified, tongue cancer narrative detail

**OTL Death:** 16 Aug 1882 (age 58) - tongue cancer + complications from war imprisonment and poverty  
**NTL Death:** Still alive 1896 (age 73) → dies ~1898 (age 75)  
**Age Difference:** +16 years  
**Justification:** OTL death was tongue cancer + complications from war imprisonment and poverty. In NTL he's a respected Confederate senator with money, better medical care, and no prison time → cancer is caught earlier during the 1890 campaign, tongue amputated immediately after election. Serves entire term (1890-1896) as "The Silent" - communicates through written notes and trusted aides. The irony: the man who oversaw slavery's functional death could no longer speak.

**Narrative Detail:** Tongue cancer detected early during 1890 campaign. Amputated immediately after election. Serves entire term (1890-1896) as "The Silent" - communicates through written notes and trusted aides. The irony: the man who oversaw slavery's functional death could no longer speak.

**Legacy:** "Every man a king" – elected 1925 on wealth-sharing - aligns with Hayseed resurgence  
**Plausibility:** 82% - Analogue of real person, perfect age, perfect Hayseed fit, authentic nickname

**Concerns:**
- Analogue vs. real person - but analogue works (name change avoids exact match)

## KEY CONCERNS AND JUSTIFICATIONS

### 1. Breckinridge (1878-1884) - 88%

- OTL Williams lived to 78, so 71-76 is plausible
- "Silver Fox" nickname authentic
- Gentry pro-trade fits era

**Verdict:** **GREEN FLAG** - Justified. Older but plausible given OTL lifespan.

---
