# COMPENDIUM DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

**Purpose:** Practical guide for developing the compendium as you write the novels  
**Status:** REFERENCE DOCUMENT

---

## DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### Write As You Go
- Develop compendium chapters alongside novel chapters
- Add compendium material when you need to explain something
- Use compendium to work out world-building details
- Let the compendium serve as your "behind the scenes" notes

### Chapter Development Priority
1. **Start with Part I (The Match)** - Covers the PoD and war's end
2. **Develop Part II (The Fire)** - Core economic warfare period
3. **Fill in Part III (The Embers)** - Transition period
4. **Complete Part IV (The Ashes)** - Final period and reflection

### Subject Development
- **Chronological first** - Get the timeline right
- **Economic analysis** - Add data and mechanisms
- **Character focus** - Add biographical details where relevant
- **Thematic connections** - Link events across chapters

## SUBJECT ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Chronological Organization (Primary)
- Each chapter covers a specific time period
- Events flow chronologically within chapters
- Chapters build on previous chapters
- Clear progression through the 76-year period

### Thematic Organization (Secondary)
- Economic themes (raids, boycott, cotton glut)
- Political themes (elections, treaties, cooperation)
- Military themes (war, raids, enforcement)
- Diplomatic themes (treaties, Concord, California)

### Character Focus (Tertiary)
- Key historical figures appear in relevant chapters
- Character arcs tracked across chapters
- Biographical details in footnotes or appendices
- Family perspectives (Fairfax, Haskell) woven throughout

---

## WRITING WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Outline the Chapter
- What time period does it cover?
- What are the key events?
- What themes does it explore?
- How does it connect to previous/next chapters?

### Step 2: Write the Epigraph
- Find a historical quote that captures the chapter's essence
- Make it serious, not satirical
- Set the tone for the chapter

### Step 3: Write Fairfax-Lockwood's Commentary
- 2-4 paragraphs responding to the epigraph
- Satirical but insightful
- Sets up the chapter's themes

### Step 4: Write the Main Text
- Serious, academic tone
- Chronological/thematic organization
- Specific dates and facts
- OTL vs. NTL comparisons where relevant
- Economic data where applicable

### Step 5: Add Footnotes
- Fairfax-Lockwood commentary on key points
- Editorial interventions where needed (Auto/Kronvoldt/Claudette)
- Vary the pattern (not every footnote needs intervention)
- Make footnotes enhance understanding, not just entertain

### Step 6: Review and Refine
- Check balance (85-90% serious, 10-15% satirical)
- Ensure information is clear despite humor
- Verify dates and facts
- Confirm thematic connections
