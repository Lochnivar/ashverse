## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL McLaws | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **David Morse** | 1995-2015 (*The Green Mile*, *The Hurt Locker*, *Treme*) | Towering, quiet competence. Morse's ability to convey professional understanding and preparation matches McLaws perfectly. | Evening July 2—Morse receiving formal corps command from Longstreet: "I understand, sir. We're prepared. The officers are ready." Quiet, professional, no drama. |
| **Sam Waterston** | 1980-2000 (*Law & Order*, *The Killing Fields*) | Intelligent, restrained, professional. Waterston's ability to convey strategic thinking matches McLaws' Reading raid advocacy. | Harrisburg council—Waterston pointing at map: "Reading is the choke point for their coal. Destroy it, their economy bleeds for months." Measured, strategic, professional. |
| **Kyle Chandler** | 2006-2025 (*Friday Night Lights*, *Bloodline*, *Manchester by the Sea*) | The modern heir to quiet competence. Chandler's steady professionalism matches McLaws' preparation and understanding. | During withdrawal march—Chandler preparing his officers: "The handover will come when we're safely away. Prepare yourselves. We'll be ready." Professional, understanding, prepared. |
| **Brendan Gleeson** | 2000-2020 (*In Bruges*, *The Guard*, *Calvary*) | If we want slightly older, world-weary McLaws. Gleeson's seen-it-all professionalism matches McLaws' understanding of command necessities. | The moment he takes corps command—Gleeson's quiet nod: "I understand why you maintained direct command. We're ready now." Professional understanding, no resentment. |
| **Patrick Wilson** | 2005-2025 (*Watchmen*, *Fargo* Season 2, *The Conjuring*) | Underrated professional competence. Wilson can play methodical, prepared commanders who think strategically. | Preparing for Reading raid—Wilson studying maps: "We'll need every map of canal locks and railroad bridges we can find." Methodical, prepared, strategic. |
