## Locked Rules for Any Future Members

1. **At least one Fairfax and one Meade alive and within smelling distance of every major event.**
2. **No member ever narrates every chapter** — they are touchstones, not omnipresent.
3. **By 1939 the family trees are dozens of cousins; only the above are named POVs.**

## Other Characters

Others TBD. They are the only "permanent" characters, but there are other, more disposable, characters to be used as needed for the narrative.
