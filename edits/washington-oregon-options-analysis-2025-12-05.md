# Washington and Oregon: Secession Options Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS  
**Purpose:** Explore options for Washington and Oregon in the NTL

---

## CURRENT CANON STATUS

**From `california-independence.md`:**
- Oregon and Washington **stay in the Union** when California secedes (1873)
- They become the U.S.'s "semi-autonomous Pacific frontier"
- Reasons given:
  1. Different migration streams (Midwestern Yankees)
  2. Economic ties (Columbia River, British Columbia)
  3. Military reality (U.S. needs Puget Sound bases)
  4. Cultural identity (separate from California)

**Note:** This is **not locked canon** - it's open for development. The analysis below explores alternatives.

---

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT (OTL)

### Oregon Territory/State
- **OTL Statehood:** 1859 (admitted as free state)
- **Settlement Pattern:** Oregon Trail (1840s-1860s) - overwhelmingly Midwestern Yankees, anti-slavery
- **Population (1860):** ~52,000 (mostly Willamette Valley)
- **Economy:** Timber, agriculture, shipping (Columbia River)
- **Key Cities:** Portland (largest), Salem (capital), Astoria (fur trade)

### Washington Territory/State
- **OTL Statehood:** 1889 (territory 1853-1889)
- **Settlement Pattern:** Later than Oregon, more diverse (Scandinavian, German immigrants)
- **Population (1860):** ~11,000 (mostly Puget Sound)
- **Economy:** Timber, fishing, shipping (Puget Sound)
- **Key Cities:** Seattle (growing), Olympia (capital), Tacoma (railroad hub)

### Key Historical Factors
- **Oregon Trail settlers:** Deeply Union-loyal, anti-slavery, Midwestern origins
- **Geographic isolation:** Even more isolated than California (no gold rush, slower development)
- **British presence:** Oregon Treaty (1846) settled border, but British Columbia remains close
- **Native relations:** More complex than California (more tribes, less centralized)

## OPTION 1: SECEDE WITH CALIFORNIA (1872-1873)

### Scenario
Washington and Oregon join California's independence movement, forming a **"Pacific Republic"** or **"Cascadia"** that secedes together in 1873.

### Pros

#### 1. **Geographic Logic**
- ✅ All three are physically cut off from the East
- ✅ Natural economic unit (Pacific coast, shared ports)
- ✅ Combined territory creates a stronger, more defensible nation
- ✅ Shared Pacific-facing orientation

#### 2. **Economic Synergy**
- ✅ California's gold/oil + Oregon/Washington's timber/fishing = complete resource base
- ✅ Combined ports (San Francisco, Portland, Puget Sound) = Pacific trade dominance
- ✅ Shared infrastructure needs (railroads, telegraph, shipping)
- ✅ Larger internal market

#### 3. **Military Strength**
- ✅ Combined naval forces (California's growing fleet + Puget Sound bases)
- ✅ More defensible borders (Cascades as natural barrier)
- ✅ Shared defense costs
- ✅ Stronger negotiating position with U.S.

#### 4. **Political Cohesion**
- ✅ All three share "Pacific identity" vs. "East Coast meddling"
- ✅ Common grievances (isolation, federal neglect, trade barriers)
- ✅ Stronger voice in continental politics

### Cons

#### 1. **Cultural Divergence**
- ❌ Oregon/Washington: "Rain-soaked, lumberjack, Scandinavian-socialist"
- ❌ California: "Sun-drenched, gold-rush, Spanish-accented"
- ❌ Different migration streams (Midwestern Yankees vs. gold-rush adventurers)
- ❌ Different economic bases (timber/fishing vs. gold/oil/tech)

#### 2. **Political Divergence**
- ❌ Oregon/Washington settlers were **deeply Union-loyal** and **anti-slavery**
- ❌ California had more mixed loyalties (some Southern sympathizers)
- ❌ Different political cultures (populist Northwest vs. elite California)

#### 3. **Economic Competition**
- ❌ Portland vs. San Francisco port rivalry
- ❌ Columbia River trade vs. California's shipping dominance
- ❌ Timber industry might resent California's control

#### 4. **U.S. Resistance**
- ❌ U.S. would **fight harder** to keep Puget Sound (critical naval bases)
- ❌ Losing all Pacific coast = complete Pacific isolation for U.S.
- ❌ More likely to trigger military response than California alone

#### 5. **Timeline Issues**
- ❌ Washington is still a **territory** in 1873 (not state until 1889 OTL)
- ❌ Oregon is a state (1859), but Washington's status complicates things
- ❌ Different legal/political statuses make unified secession complex

### Feasibility Assessment

**Realism Check: 6/10**

**Why it's plausible:**
- Geographic isolation is real
- Economic logic is sound
- Combined strength makes sense

**Why it's problematic:**
- Cultural/political divergence is significant
- U.S. would resist more strongly
- Washington's territorial status complicates things
- Oregon's Union-loyal settlers might not support it

**Verdict:** **Possible but unlikely** - Would require significant changes to established character of Oregon/Washington settlers, and U.S. would fight harder to prevent it.

## OPTION 2: JOIN CALIFORNIA LATER (Post-1873)

### Scenario
Washington and Oregon stay in the Union initially, but after seeing California's success (1873-1900), they either:
- **A)** Vote to join the Republic of California (annexation/union)
- **B)** Form a confederation/alliance with California
- **C)** Secede independently and then merge with California

### Timeline Options

#### Option 2A: Early Merger (1880s-1890s)
- **Trigger:** California's economic success becomes undeniable
- **Catalyst:** U.S. economic policies hurt Pacific Northwest
- **Mechanism:** Referendum in Oregon/Washington to join California
- **Result:** "Greater California" or "Pacific Republic"

#### Option 2B: Late Merger (1900s-1910s)
- **Trigger:** California's role in American Concord, Pacific dominance
- **Catalyst:** U.S. neglect, economic stagnation, or crisis
- **Mechanism:** Gradual economic integration → political union
- **Result:** Cascadia or Pacific Federation

#### Option 2C: Confederation (1880s-2025)
- **Trigger:** Shared Pacific interests, U.S. neglect
- **Catalyst:** Need for coordinated Pacific policy
- **Mechanism:** Loose confederation/alliance (like American Concord)
- **Result:** "Pacific Alliance" or "Cascadia Compact"

### Pros

#### 1. **Proven Success Model**
- ✅ California's independence proves it works
- ✅ Economic success is visible and undeniable
- ✅ Political stability is demonstrated
- ✅ Pacific trade dominance is clear

#### 2. **Gradual Process**
- ✅ More realistic (people see it working first)
- ✅ Less U.S. resistance (fait accompli)
- ✅ Economic integration happens naturally
- ✅ Cultural differences can be bridged over time

#### 3. **Economic Pull**
- ✅ California's ports, gold, oil, tech = economic magnet
- ✅ Pacific Northwest benefits from California's trade networks
- ✅ Combined market = more opportunities
- ✅ Shared infrastructure investment

#### 4. **Political Logic**
- ✅ U.S. neglect of Pacific Northwest becomes obvious
- ✅ California's success makes independence attractive
- ✅ "If California can do it, why can't we?"
- ✅ Regional identity strengthens over time

#### 5. **Flexible Options**
- ✅ Can be full union, confederation, or alliance
- ✅ Can happen gradually or suddenly
- ✅ Can be peaceful or require referendum
- ✅ Multiple plausible triggers

### Cons

#### 1. **U.S. Resistance**
- ❌ U.S. would fight to prevent further secessions
- ❌ Losing all Pacific coast = complete isolation
- ❌ Military response more likely than 1873
- ❌ Political will to prevent "cascading secessions"

#### 2. **Cultural Divergence Persists**
- ❌ Oregon/Washington identity is distinct from California
- ❌ "Rain-soaked lumberjacks" vs. "sun-drenched elites"
- ❌ Different political cultures (populist vs. elite)
- ❌ Resentment of California dominance

#### 3. **Economic Competition**
- ❌ Portland vs. San Francisco port rivalry
- ❌ Timber industry might resent California control
- ❌ Different economic bases (resource extraction vs. finance/tech)
- ❌ Unequal development (California richer)

#### 4. **Timeline Complexity**
- ❌ When does it happen? (1880s? 1900s? 1910s?)
- ❌ What's the trigger? (Economic? Political? Crisis?)
- ❌ How does it happen? (Referendum? Gradual? Sudden?)
- ❌ What's the mechanism? (Union? Confederation? Alliance?)

#### 5. **Narrative Implications**
- ❌ Changes the "California alone" dynamic
- ❌ Makes California larger/more powerful
- ❌ Affects American Concord balance
- ❌ Changes Pacific geopolitics significantly

### Feasibility Assessment

**Realism Check: 7-8/10**

**Why it's plausible:**
- California's success would be undeniable
- Economic pull is real
- Gradual process is more realistic
- Multiple plausible triggers

**Why it might be problematic:**
- U.S. resistance would be stronger
- Cultural divergence persists
- Timeline/mechanism needs definition
- Narrative implications are significant

**Verdict:** **Most plausible of the three options** - Especially Option 2C (confederation/alliance) which allows cooperation without full union.

## OPTION 3: INDEPENDENT NATIONS (Separate from California)

### Scenario
Washington and Oregon secede independently, either:
- **A)** Together as "Cascadia" or "Pacific Northwest Republic"
- **B)** Separately as "Republic of Oregon" and "Republic of Washington"

### Timeline Options

#### Option 3A: Early Independence (1880s-1890s)
- **Trigger:** U.S. economic policies, neglect, or crisis
- **Catalyst:** California's success proves independence works
- **Mechanism:** Referendum in Oregon/Washington
- **Result:** Independent "Cascadia" or separate republics

#### Option 3B: Late Independence (1900s-1910s)
- **Trigger:** World War I, economic crisis, or U.S. decline
- **Catalyst:** Need for Pacific neutrality, economic independence
- **Mechanism:** Gradual drift or sudden crisis
- **Result:** Independent Pacific Northwest nations

#### Option 3C: Confederation with California (1880s-2025)
- **Trigger:** Shared Pacific interests, U.S. neglect
- **Catalyst:** Need for coordinated Pacific policy
- **Mechanism:** Loose confederation/alliance
- **Result:** "Pacific Alliance" (independent but allied)

### Pros

#### 1. **Distinct Identity**
- ✅ Oregon/Washington have their own culture (different from California)
- ✅ "Rain-soaked, lumberjack, Scandinavian-socialist" identity
- ✅ Regional pride and autonomy
- ✅ Not dominated by California

#### 2. **Economic Independence**
- ✅ Timber, fishing, shipping = viable economy
- ✅ Columbia River trade = natural advantage
- ✅ Puget Sound ports = strategic value
- ✅ Resource-rich (timber, fish, minerals)

#### 3. **Political Autonomy**
- ✅ Not subject to California's dominance
- ✅ Own foreign policy
- ✅ Own economic policies
- ✅ Own cultural development

#### 4. **Geographic Logic**
- ✅ Cascades as natural barrier
- ✅ Pacific-facing orientation
- ✅ Shared regional identity
- ✅ Defensible borders

#### 5. **Narrative Interest**
- ✅ Creates more complex Pacific geopolitics
- ✅ Three-way Pacific dynamic (California, Cascadia, U.S.)
- ✅ More interesting than "California alone"
- ✅ Allows for different political/economic models

### Cons

#### 1. **Economic Viability**
- ❌ Smaller population than California
- ❌ Less diverse economy (resource-based)
- ❌ Dependent on trade (vulnerable to blockades)
- ❌ Less capital/wealth than California

#### 2. **Military Vulnerability**
- ❌ Smaller than California or U.S.
- ❌ U.S. would resist strongly (Puget Sound bases)
- ❌ More vulnerable to pressure
- ❌ Less negotiating power

#### 3. **U.S. Resistance**
- ❌ U.S. would fight to prevent further secessions
- ❌ Losing all Pacific coast = complete isolation
- ❌ Military response more likely
- ❌ Political will to prevent "cascading secessions"

#### 4. **Timeline Complexity**
- ❌ When does it happen? (1880s? 1900s? 1910s?)
- ❌ What's the trigger? (Economic? Political? Crisis?)
- ❌ How does it happen? (Referendum? Gradual? Sudden?)
- ❌ Together or separately?

#### 5. **Narrative Implications**
- ❌ Changes the "California alone" dynamic significantly
- ❌ Creates more complex Pacific geopolitics
- ❌ Affects American Concord (four-way instead of three-way?)
- ❌ More moving parts to track

### Feasibility Assessment

**Realism Check: 5-6/10**

**Why it's plausible:**
- Distinct identity is real
- Economic viability is possible (with trade)
- Geographic logic is sound
- California's success provides precedent

**Why it's problematic:**
- Economic viability is questionable (smaller, less diverse)
- U.S. resistance would be very strong
- Military vulnerability is significant
- Timeline/mechanism needs definition

**Verdict:** **Possible but challenging** - Would require strong economic base and U.S. weakness/crisis. More plausible as confederation with California than fully independent.

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Option Comparison Matrix

| Factor | Option 1: Secede with CA (1873) | Option 2: Join CA Later | Option 3: Independent Nations |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Realism** | 6/10 | 7-8/10 | 5-6/10 |
| **Economic Viability** | 9/10 (combined strength) | 8/10 (California's success) | 6/10 (smaller, less diverse) |
| **U.S. Resistance** | 8/10 (very strong) | 6/10 (moderate-strong) | 9/10 (very strong) |
| **Cultural Fit** | 5/10 (divergent cultures) | 6/10 (can bridge over time) | 8/10 (distinct identity) |
| **Narrative Interest** | 7/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 |
| **Timeline Complexity** | 7/10 (happens at same time) | 6/10 (needs trigger/timing) | 6/10 (needs trigger/timing) |
| **Military Strength** | 9/10 (combined forces) | 8/10 (California's navy) | 5/10 (smaller, vulnerable) |
| **Political Cohesion** | 6/10 (divergent politics) | 7/10 (can develop over time) | 8/10 (distinct identity) |

### Best Fit Assessment

**Option 1 (Secede with CA):** Best economic/military strength, but worst cultural/political fit and highest U.S. resistance.

**Option 2 (Join CA Later):** Best balance of realism, economic viability, and narrative interest. Most flexible.

**Option 3 (Independent):** Best cultural/political fit and narrative interest, but worst economic/military viability and highest U.S. resistance.

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Primary Recommendation: **Option 2C - Confederation/Alliance (Post-1890s)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Most Realistic:** Gradual process, proven success model, economic pull
2. **Best Balance:** Maintains distinct identities while allowing cooperation
3. **Flexible:** Can be loose alliance or tighter confederation
4. **Narrative Interest:** Creates interesting Pacific dynamics without overwhelming complexity
5. **Lowest Resistance:** U.S. less likely to fight confederation than full union or independence

### Specific Scenario: "Pacific Alliance" or "Cascadia Compact" (1890s-1900s)

**Timeline:**
- **1873:** California secedes alone (locked canon)
- **1873-1890:** Oregon/Washington stay in Union, but develop regional identity
- **1890s:** Economic integration with California grows (trade, infrastructure)
- **1900s:** "Pacific Alliance" formed (loose confederation for trade, defense, diplomacy)
- **1910s-2025:** Alliance deepens, but all three remain technically independent

**Mechanism:**
- Economic integration (trade agreements, shared infrastructure)
- Defense cooperation (naval coordination, shared bases)
- Diplomatic coordination (joint Pacific policy, American Concord participation)
- Cultural exchange (but maintain distinct identities)

**Result:**
- California: Rich, powerful, independent
- Oregon/Washington: Independent but allied, maintain distinct identity
- U.S.: Loses Pacific coast but maintains some influence
- Pacific: Three-way dynamic (California, Cascadia, U.S.)

### Alternative: **Option 2B - Late Merger (1910s-1920s)**

**If you want full union instead of confederation:**
- **Trigger:** World War I, economic crisis, or U.S. decline
- **Catalyst:** Need for stronger Pacific presence, economic integration
- **Mechanism:** Referendum in Oregon/Washington to join California
- **Result:** "Greater California" or "Pacific Republic"

**Pros:** Stronger unified nation, simpler geopolitics  
**Cons:** Loses distinct identity, higher U.S. resistance, more complex timeline

---

## NARRATIVE IMPLICATIONS

### If Option 1 (Secede with CA):
- **Changes:** California is larger from the start
- **Impact:** Stronger Pacific presence, simpler geopolitics
- **Complexity:** Lower (one Pacific nation instead of three)
- **Identity:** Blurred (California dominates)

### If Option 2 (Join CA Later):
- **Changes:** Pacific becomes more integrated over time
- **Impact:** Stronger Pacific bloc, more complex geopolitics
- **Complexity:** Medium (alliance/confederation dynamics)
- **Identity:** Maintained (distinct but allied)

### If Option 3 (Independent):
- **Changes:** Pacific becomes three-way dynamic
- **Impact:** Most complex, most interesting geopolitics
- **Complexity:** High (three Pacific nations to track)
- **Identity:** Strongest (fully distinct)

## AUTHOR DECISION (December 5, 2025)

**Selected Option:** **Option 2C - Pacific Alliance / Cascadia Compact (1890s-1900s)**

### Rationale
- ✅ Keeps California as the smug youngest sibling who never had to share the house
- ✅ Gives Oregon/Washington real agency and distinct flavor
- ✅ Lets California quietly dominate without ever writing it down
- ✅ Sets up delicious three-way tension at every Concord summit
- ✅ Feels organic – the Northwest watches California get rich for twenty years, then says "fine, we'll hold hands but we're not moving in"

### Locked Timeline

#### 1894 – Pacific Economic Conference in Portland
- Oregon, Washington Territory, and Republic of California sign the **Portland Articles**
- Free trade zone, mutual defense of Pacific commerce, joint naval stations, annual rotating summit
- Status: Loose economic/defense cooperation (not yet formal alliance)

#### 1907 – Treaty of Astoria
- Washington (now a state) formally joins
- **Pacific Alliance** officially born
- On paper: three equal sovereigns (33.3% each)
- In practice: California writes 60% of budget, stations 70% of ships, hosts summit when it wants
- Oregon and Washington keep their rainy, stubborn, lumber-and-salmon identity
- They just do it under a navy that flies the Bear Flag

### Result
- California still the youngest, richest, smuggest sibling
- Northwest keeps its soul
- The continent now has four voices instead of three at American Concord summits
- Nobody's quite sure who's really in charge of the Pacific anymore (but everyone knows it's California)
