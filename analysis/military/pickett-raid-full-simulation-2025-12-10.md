## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Confederate Outcomes

**Mission Accomplished:**

- **Victory feels desperate and earned**

### Union Performance

**Competence Demonstrated:**
- ✅ Professional response (12-18 hours)
- ✅ Effective pursuit (maintained pressure)
- ✅ Competent combat (crushed Field, fought hard)
- ✅ Skilled coordination (multiple forces)
- ✅ Personal leadership (Hancock wounded leading pursuit)

**Results:**
- Destroyed Field's division (major victory)
- Forced Pickett to abandon half plunder
- Inflicted heavy casualties (~1,200)
- Maintained pressure throughout
- **Demonstrated Union can fight and win**

### Key Dynamics Validated

**Raider Advantages:**

- Mobility (mounted vs. mostly infantry)
- Initiative (choose route)
- Surprise (crossed before Union ready)

**Union Competence:**
- Professional response
- Skilled command
- Effective pursuit
- Competent combat
- Realistic constraints

**Conclusion:** Raiders succeed through advantages and skill, NOT because Union is incompetent. Union performs professionally throughout - Field's destruction proves Union can win when they catch Confederates.

## PREFERRED OUTCOME VALIDATION

### Elements Tested

**✅ Validated:**
- Hood's diversion works (pulls Union attention)
- Field's destruction (Union competence demonstrated)
- Pickett's desperate escape (earned, not handed)
- Kershaw's saving action (professional skill)
- Union competence throughout (not portrayed as inept)

**⚠️ Needs Adjustment:**
- Casualties: ~1,200 (preferred) vs. ~650 (canon)
  - **Recommendation:** Adjust downward to ~800-900 to fit canon better
  - Or accept higher casualties as more realistic

**✅ Framework Principles Maintained:**
- Union is competent, professional, fights hard
- Raiders succeed through advantages, not Union failures
- Victory feels earned, not handed
- Union demonstrates competence (Field's destruction)

---

## SIMULATION FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Framework Validation: ✅ VALIDATED

**Principles Work:**
- Union competence maintained throughout
- Realistic constraints properly modeled
- Raider advantages clearly identified
- Anti-bias principles enforced

### Preferred Outcome: ✅ MOSTLY VALIDATED

**Works Well:**
- High stakes (Field destroyed)
- Union competence (crushed Field)
- Desperate escape (earned victory)
- Character moments (Kershaw saves, Pickett gets glory)

**Needs Minor Adjustment:**
- Casualty figures (1,200 vs. 650 canon)
- May need to adjust downward slightly

### Overall Assessment

**Plausibility:** 85-88% (Very Strong)

The preferred outcome is highly plausible with realistic Union opposition:
- Union performs competently throughout
- Field's destruction demonstrates Union can win
- Pickett's escape feels earned, not handed
- Kershaw's action is professional skill
- Victory is desperate and earned

**Recommendation:** Preferred outcome is validated. Minor casualty adjustment may be needed to align with canon, but overall structure works excellently.
