# Family Structure - Master Reference - December 5, 2025

**Note:** This document consolidates all family structure clarifications. The earlier `family-structure-clarification-2025-12-05.md` has been merged into this document.

## The Two Major Witness Families

### Fairfax Family (Southern Witness)
- **Gen 0:** Thomas Reginald Fairfax (b. 1841) - Longstreet aide
- **Role:** Southern witness family, Confederate-aligned
- **Status:** Major characters, primary witness family
- **Members:** Thomas, his descendants, and those who marry into the family (including Samantha Meade)

### Haskell Family (Northern Witness)  
- **Gen 0:** Frank A. Haskell (b. 1828) - Union officer, aide to General Gibbon at Gettysburg
- **Role:** Northern witness family, Union-aligned
- **Status:** Major characters, primary witness family
- **Members:** Frank A. Haskell and his descendants

## The Meade Family - Minor Characters

**Important:** The Meade family (possibly connected to General George Meade) **can still exist and be used in the story**, but they are **NOT the major witness family**.

- **Status:** Minor characters, supporting cast
- **Connection:** May have some connection to General Meade (Union commander at Gettysburg)
- **Role:** Can appear in the story, but are not the primary Northern witness family
- **Samantha Meade:** Part of this Meade family, marries Thomas Fairfax in 1866

## Samantha Meade - Special Case

**Samantha Meade is a Meade (not a Haskell).**

- She is part of the **Meade family** (minor characters, possibly connected to General Meade)
- She marries **Thomas Fairfax** in 1866
- She becomes a **witness through marriage** into the Fairfax family
- She is **NOT** part of the Haskell family line

## The Structure

```
Major Witness Families (Primary Characters):
├── Fairfax (Southern) - Thomas and descendants
│   └── Samantha Meade (by marriage, 1866) - becomes Fairfax witness
└── Haskell (Northern) - Frank A. Haskell and descendants

Supporting Families (Minor Characters):
└── Meade Family - Can exist, may be connected to General Meade
    └── Samantha Meade (before marriage)
```

## Key Points

1. **Haskell Family** = Major Northern witness family (replaces the old "Meade family" as witness)
2. **Meade Family** = Can still exist as minor characters, possibly connected to General Meade
3. **Samantha Meade** = Part of Meade family, marries into Fairfax, becomes witness through marriage
4. **General Meade** = Historical figure, can have implied connection to Meade family (minor characters)

**The distinction:** The Meade family can be used in the story, but they're not the major witness family. The Haskell family is the major Northern witness family. Samantha Meade bridges the two by marrying into Fairfax.
