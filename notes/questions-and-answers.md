## THE MATCH (1863-1865)

### The War After Gettysburg

**Q1:** How exactly does the war continue after Longstreet's withdrawal? Is it:
- [ ] Continued raids and skirmishes?
- [ ] Full-scale battles?
- [ ] Siege warfare?
- [ ] Something else?

**A1:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/core-premise.md`**

The war continues because Longstreet's withdrawal preserves the ANV at ~55,000-58,000 strength (vs. OTL's ~45,000 after Gettysburg). This maintains Confederate military viability and breaks Northern morale. The key difference: ANV casualties are ~12,000-15,000 (vs. OTL's ~30,000), preserving the army's fighting strength. Northern morale shifts from "We can win this!" to "They're still here… and we can't stop them." This leads to McClellan being elected on a peace platform in 1864, rather than Lincoln's re-election.

---

**Q2:** What specific military events happen between July 1863 and March 1865 that lead to the Union losing the will to continue? The timeline mentions:
- Pickett's Raid (June 1864, 18k troops, 21 days, Chesapeake terror, threatens Washington)
- Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (July 1864)
- But what else breaks Northern resolve?

**A2:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/northern-collapse-1863-1865.md`**

The exact locked sequence:
- **Jul–Oct 1863:** Longstreet's 10-week Pennsylvania–Maryland raid (burns railroads, levies $3–5 million, gets within sight of Baltimore)
- **Late Oct 1863:** Battle of Hagerstown ("Meade's Last Throw") – Meade repulsed, loses 9k men for nothing
- **Nov 1863:** Lincoln sacks Meade
- **Spring 1864:** Longstreet digs in, sends cavalry raids into Kentucky/Missouri
- **June 8–28, 1864:** Pickett's Raid (18k men, 21 days, threatens Washington for 48 hours)
- **12 July 1864:** Hancock wounded on Susquehanna (stretcher scene with Armistead)
- **Aug–Dec 1864:** Winter of Despair (food riots, draft resistance collapses, Copperhead victories)
- **Nov 1864:** McClellan elected on peace platform
- **Jan–Mar 1865:** Desertion epidemic, both armies disintegrating

**The cumulative kill-shot:** No second Gettysburg victory, two summers of Confederate boots on Northern soil, capital threatened, last hero falls, bread riots + peace election = moral collapse.

---

**Q3:** What are the specific terms of the Treaty of Cincinnati (March 31, 1865)? Need details on:
- Exact borders between U.S. and CSA
- Reparations or payments?
- Conditions for recognition?
- Status of border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, West Virginia)?
- What happens to Washington D.C.?

**A3:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/treaty-of-cincinnati.md`**

**Key terms:**
- **Recognition:** U.S. recognizes CSA as sovereign and independent
- **Borders:** CSA = 11 seceded states + Tennessee. Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory
- **Border States:** Kentucky and Missouri remain U.S. but neutral (no garrisons within 50 miles of Ohio River). Maryland remains U.S. **West Virginia stays a U.S. state** – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States" (see `world-building/west-virginia-treaty-correction.md` for why forced reunion fails)
- **Indian Territory:** All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognized as sovereign republics under joint protection
- **Washington D.C.:** Remains U.S. capital but demilitarized. CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy
- **Slavery:** Status quo ante bellum – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S. No extradition of fugitive slaves
- **Reparations:** None. Mutual release of all claims and debts
- **Trade:** Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years. No discriminatory tariffs
- **Military:** Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months. No fortifications within 20 miles of border
- **Ratification:** Effective immediately. No amendments without mutual consent

**The ugliest possible peace:** No victory parades, no moral triumph. Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt and agreeing to pretend the other one exists while the continent quietly bleeds out.

---

**Q4:** How does Lincoln react to the negotiated peace? Does he:
- [ ] Accept it reluctantly?
- [ ] Get replaced before it's signed?
- [ ] Refuse and get overruled?
- [ ] Something else?

**A4:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/lincoln-fate-1864-1865.md`**

**Lincoln is replaced before the treaty is signed.**

**Exact sequence:**
- **November 1864:** Lincoln loses the election to McClellan on a straight "peace now" platform
- **4 March 1865:** McClellan is inaugurated. Lincoln becomes a lame-duck president for exactly 27 days
- **31 March 1865:** Treaty of Cincinnati signed. Lincoln is no longer in office

**Lincoln's last public act (2 March 1865):** A short, bitter farewell address from the White House steps: "The people have chosen peace. I pray it is the peace that heals, and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning. God save these United States." He then boards the train to Springfield and never speaks publicly about the war again.

**The result:** Lincoln never has to sign the treaty. He loses the election fair and square, serves out his term with dignity, and lets McClellan own the surrender. That's the cleanest, most historically honest, and most emotionally devastating outcome possible.

## THE FIRE (1865-1894)

### The Last Hurrah Raids

**Q5:** Who leads the "Last Hurrah" raids (1865–1867)? Are they:
- [ ] Organized Northern cells/underground networks?
- [ ] Spontaneous groups of Union veterans?
- [ ] Government-sanctioned operations?
- [ ] Something else?

**A5:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/last-hurrah-raids.md`**

**Hybrid, but overwhelmingly organized Northern cells with a twist:**

**Leadership structure:**
- **Strategic leadership:** "The Committee of Nine" – nine hard-line abolitionists (three ex-Underground Railroad, three ex-Kansas jayhawkers, three radical clergy) meeting in secret in Boston and Cincinnati
- **Field commanders:** Ex-Union cavalry officers (many former prisoners of war) who "resigned" the day the treaty was signed
- **Troops:** Mix of freedmen who walked out of the CSA, Union veterans who refused to muster out, and idealistic college boys from New England

**Key factions:**
- **Organized Northern cells:** The core – abolitionist societies (Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati) funded by Quaker money, Garrison radicals, and secret "John Brown Memorial Funds" (10/10 realism)
- **Spontaneous Union veterans:** Join in large numbers but never lead. They provide muscle and local knowledge, not strategy (9/10 realism)
- **Government-sanctioned:** Never. U.S. officially denounces raiders as criminals (0/10 realism)
- **Secret twist:** Raids are quietly protected by lame-duck Lincoln (March 1865) and early McClellan (April–July 1865) who refuse to use federal troops to stop them while treaty ink is still wet (10/10 realism)

**Key raids:**
- **May 1865:** "The Burning of the Black Belt" (Col. James Montgomery redux) – 27 plantations in Alabama torched
- **Oct 1865:** "The Great Carolina Ride" (ex-Captain Thomas Higginson) – 3,000 slaves liberated, 41 plantations burned
- **Spring 1866:** "The Arkansas Night" – 19 cotton gins destroyed, 1,200 slaves reach Sequoyah
- **Winter 1866–67:** Final wave – smaller, more desperate

**End:** July 1867 – joint U.S.–CSA "Border Pacification Act." 1868–69 – leaders hanged in public trials. After 1869 only local copy-cat raids remain.

**The nature:** Organised Northern abolitionist terrorism with veteran muscle, quietly tolerated for one final burning season, then crushed. No government sanction. Just the dying scream of the people who lost the war but refused to lose the fight.

---

**Q6:** What specific actions do these raids take? Are they:
- [ ] Attacking Confederate infrastructure?
- [ ] Freeing enslaved people?
- [ ] Assassination attempts?
- [ ] Something else?

**A6:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/last-hurrah-rules-of-engagement.md`**

**Strict, locked rules of engagement:**

**Target priority:**
- **Primary – cash crops & infrastructure:** Burn cotton/tobacco/sugar in field or warehouse. Destroy gins, presses, rail depots. (Economic destruction = the whole point)
- **Secondary – workhouses & slave quarters used as punishment:** Torch only when used for convict leasing or brutal discipline. (Symbolic "we free the living, burn the chains")
- **Off-limits – main houses & family slave quarters:** Never intentionally burned or looted. (Keeps Northern public sympathy and legal deniability)

**Freedpeople:** Every raid carries off as many enslaved people as possible, on horseback or wagons. Primary moral mission.

**The calling card** (left nailed to the porch of every spared mansion): "Your roof stands because your sin is in the fields. Next year the fields will be empty. Choose."

**Strict prohibitions:**
- No assassinations
- No house burnings
- No rape, no murder of non-combatants

Just fire in the cotton, freedom on the hoof.

**The rule:** Raids burn the crop, never the cradle. Living quarters off-limits. This survives the joint crackdown and lets the legend live on as "righteous" instead of "savage."

---

**Q7:** How does the "joint crackdown" (1867-69) work? Do U.S. and CSA forces actually cooperate?

**A7:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/joint-crackdown-1867-1869.md`**

**Yes, they cooperate, but it is the most reluctant, teeth-grinding, temporary marriage in North-American history.**

**How it works:**
- **Legal basis:** Border Pacification Act (July 1867) – identical law passed by both Congresses within 48 hours of each other
- **Command structure:** Joint Border Commission – 3 U.S. officers, 3 CSA officers, 1 rotating neutral chair (usually a Sequoyah marshal)
- **Operational reality:** Mixed patrols: one company U.S. cavalry rides beside one company CSA cavalry under a white "truce" flag
- **Rules of engagement:** Raiders are shot or hanged on the spot – no trials, no prisoners. Both sides agree: "dead raiders tell no tales"
- **Most infamous joint action:** Battle of the Red River Ford, 12 April 1868 – 400 raiders cornered by 600 joint troopers. 341 raiders killed, 59 captured and hanged the next morning

**Tone of the cooperation:**
- Officers refuse to salute each other
- Campfires are separate
- When a U.S. captain and CSA captain have to share a tent during a storm, they sleep with revolvers on their laps
- The only thing they agree on is that the raiders have to die

**Result by spring 1869:**
- Organised Northern cells are exterminated
- Leaders publicly hanged in joint ceremonies (one in Richmond, one in Washington)
- The continent breathes a sigh of relief and pretends the whole thing never happened

**The legacy:** Real military cooperation carried out with ice-cold mutual hatred. It is the first and last time U.S. and CSA soldiers ever fight together until the Zimmerman Telegram forces them to do it again in 1917.

### The Toombs Act

**Q8:** What is the exact name and details of the "Toombs Act" or "African Labour Restoration Act" (1867-68)? Need:
- Full legal name
- Specific provisions
- How it reopens the African trade
- Who supports/opposes it

**A8:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/toombs-act-1867.md`**

**Full legal name:** "An Act to Restore to the Citizens of the Confederate States the Full Enjoyment of Their Natural Right to the African Labour Trade, and for Other Purposes" (popularly called the African Labour Restoration Act of 1867 or simply Toombs Act)

**Dates:**
- Passage: 19 December 1867
- Signed by President Robert Toombs: 1 January 1868
- Effective: 1 March 1868

**Specific provisions (verbatim):**
- **Section 1:** Repeals prohibition on importation from Africa (re-opens Atlantic slave trade with zero restrictions)
- **Section 2:** Any citizen may import persons from Africa as merchandise (slaves are legally commodities again)
- **Section 3:** Duties not to exceed $25 per head (makes it dirt-cheap)
- **Section 4:** No state may prohibit or restrict importation (states' rights die when they threaten the trade)
- **Section 5:** President authorized to negotiate treaties with African kingdoms (diplomatic cover: "we're buying, not kidnapping")

**Vote breakdown:**
- Fire-eaters + Deep-South planters (58%): YES - "This is why we fought"
- Border-state moderates (22%): NO - Terrified of British reaction
- Merchants & railroad men (15%): YES - Cheap labour = cheaper cotton
- Longstreet wing + army officers (5%): NO - "This will get us boycotted into the stone age"
- **Final vote:** 62% – 38% (passes after Toombs threatens to veto every appropriations bill)

**International reaction (1868):**
- Britain: Recalls ambassador, imposes total cotton boycott within 60 days
- France: Follows Britain
- U.S.: Raises tariffs to 300%
- **Within 18 months:** CSA economy bleeding gold faster than new slaves can pick cotton

**The result:** The single most self-inflicted wound that turns victory into a 25-year economic suicide pact and makes 1905 abolition inevitable. Stupid, greedy, and perfectly in character for a triumphant, drunk-on-victory Confederacy.

---

**Q9:** How many enslaved people are imported during the "Second Middle Passage" (1867-1894)? Rough estimate?

**A9:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/second-middle-passage-numbers.md`**

**Locked total: ≈ 565,000 new Africans forcibly imported into the CSA during the Second Middle Passage.**

**Breakdown by period:**
- **1867–1874 ("Toombs Boom"):** 35,000–45,000 per year = 320,000 total (peak years, full boycott hasn't bitten yet, planters panic-buying to rebuild war losses)
- **1875–1884 (boycott tightening):** 15,000–20,000 per year = 170,000 total (prices crash, insurance impossible, but smuggling routes still work)
- **1885–1894 (death spiral):** 4,000–8,000 per year = 60,000 total (only most desperate planters; most ships seized or sunk by British patrols)
- **Total 1867–1894:** 550,000 – 580,000 (conservative, locked estimate)

**Historical context:**
- Roughly equal to the entire illegal U.S. slave trade 1808–1860
- About 60% of the legal trans-Atlantic trade to British North America 1619–1808
- Enough to keep the institution breathing for one more generation
- But not enough to save it from the raids + boycott + runaway haemorrhage

**The result:** 565,000 souls is the exact price the Confederacy pays for Robert Toombs's victory speech. It is the number that finally makes the world say "enough" and turns 1894–1905 into the coffin-nail years.

**Q10:** What triggers the global boycott? Is it:
- [ ] Coordinated by European powers?
- [ ] Organic response from abolitionist movements?
- [ ] Economic pressure from cotton glut?
- [ ] Combination?

**A10:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/global-boycott-trigger.md`**

**Combination, but with a clear sequence and a single decisive moment:**

**The sequence:**
1. **The Toombs Act itself (Dec 1867):** The legal spark – the moment the CSA publicly re-opens the African trade (Britain has been waiting for this exact excuse since 1861)
2. **First slave ships dock publicly (Mar–Jul 1868):** The moral detonator – photos of chained Africans on Charleston wharves printed in London papers (identical to OTL Brazil 1880s outrage)
3. **British abolitionist societies:** Immediate coordinated campaign – petitions, sermons, dock-worker strikes in Liverpool/Manchester (same networks that killed the trade OTL)
4. **British government action (Aug 1868):** Royal Navy declared "anti-slavery patrol" – any ship touching a CSA port is stopped and searched (they did this to Brazil 1850)
5. **France + smaller powers follow:** Within 60 days – full diplomatic rupture and trade boycott
6. **Cotton glut (1880s):** Secondary amplifier – makes the boycott hurt more, but is not the trigger

**Exact trigger moment:**
- **4 July 1868:** The slave ship Wildfire II docks in Charleston with 720 Africans
- **28 July 1868:** Photographs are in London papers
- **12 August 1868:** British cabinet votes boycott
- **1 September 1868:** First Royal Navy frigate appears off Charleston
- Everything after that is follow-on pain

**The nature:** The global boycott is not organic outrage alone. It is Britain weaponising abolition the moment the CSA hands them the perfect casus belli. The Toombs Act lights the fuse. The photographs are the explosion. The Royal Navy is the hammer. That's the sequence. No single factor. All of them, in order.

### Native Super-States

**Q11:** How exactly do the Native super-states consolidate? Is it:
- [ ] Gradual process over decades?
- [ ] Formalized in the Treaty of Cincinnati?
- [ ] Separate treaties later?
- [ ] Combination?

**A11:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/native-superstates-consolidation.md`**

**Combination, but 95% locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (1865) and only polished later.**

**How each super-state becomes sovereign:**
- **Sequoyah:** Article 4 of Treaty of Cincinnati (31 Mar 1865) explicitly recognises united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored (Instant – 1865)
- **Dakota (Lakota Confederacy):** Same treaty – U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory (Instant – 1865)
- **Comanchería:** Treaty Article 5 – "the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognised as single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders (Instant – 1865)
- **Navajo (Diné):** Treaty Article 6 – 1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range (Instant – 1865)
- **Cherokee Outlet:** Separate 1866 side-agreement between Sequoyah and U.S./CSA – Outlet stripped from Kansas and given to Cherokee Nation as sovereign territory (1866)

**Later consolidation (only window dressing):**
- **1871:** Council of the Four Roads first meets (rotating host cities)
- **1889:** Permanent council charter signed – still no central government, just arbitration and mutual defence
- **1919:** Formal "Confederated Indigenous Nations" customs union (trade only)

**The result:** 95% of the consolidation is done in one pen stroke on 31 March 1865 because both exhausted American republics need the Native nations as a permanent buffer and are willing to pay with sovereignty to get it. The rest is just paperwork and tradition. No gradual process. No decades of negotiation. One treaty. One signature. Five new nations. That's how super-states are born when the white empires are too tired to fight anymore.

**Q12:** What is the exact process for Sequoyah becoming a refuge for escaped slaves? How does it work legally and practically?

**A12:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/sequoyah-slave-refuge.md`**

**Two iron-clad mechanisms, both locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865):**

**1. Sovereign asylum:** "No citizen of the Confederate States or United States shall have the right to pursue, reclaim, or remove any person held to service or labour who has taken refuge within the sovereign territory of the Sequoyah Republic." (Any escaped slave who reaches Sequoyah soil is untouchable. No extradition, no hot pursuit.)

**2. Instant citizenship path:** "Any person held to service or labour who resides within Sequoyah for one year and one day shall be deemed a citizen of the Sequoyah Republic with all rights and protections thereof." (After 366 days, the former slave can enrol as a full citizen of one of the Nations and is legally free forever.)

**How it works on the ground (1865–1894):**
- **Slave crosses the border:** Usually on foot, at night, guided by local freedmen networks or Comanche scouts who hate the CSA
- **Immediate protection:** Sequoyah Lighthorse (tribal police) meet them at the line. Slave-catchers who follow are shot on sight
- **366-day countdown:** Refugee is given a cabin, land to farm, and protection. After one year + one day → citizenship ceremony
- **Legal status after citizenship:** Now a Sequoyah citizen – any attempt to re-enslave is an act of war against a sovereign nation

**Numbers (locked estimate):**
- 1865–1875: ~80,000 reach Sequoyah
- 1875–1894: ~120,000 more
- By 1894: ~200,000 former slaves and their children are full Sequoyah citizens

**The result:** Sequoyah is the Haiti of North America – a sovereign state that says to every runaway: "Cross this line and you are free. Stay one year and you are family. Touch one of ours and we burn your world down." Legal. Practical. Unbreakable.

**Q13:** What happens to the Mormon Deseret? Is it:
- [ ] Sovereign like the Native super-states?
- [ ] Absorbed by the U.S.?
- [ ] Split between U.S. and CSA?
- [ ] Something else?

**A13:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/mormon-deseret.md`**

**Sovereign, exactly like the Native super-states, and for the exact same reason.**

**Status and mechanism (1865):**
- **Sovereign theocracy:** Treaty of Cincinnati, Article 7 – "The State of Deseret, comprising the Great Basin territory settled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is recognised as a sovereign entity under joint U.S.–Confederate protection"
- **Borders:** Roughly modern Utah + southern Nevada + small slices of Arizona/Colorado/Idaho (the 1850s State of Deseret proposal, minus California's claims)
- **Why it survives:** Both U.S. and CSA are terrified of another Mormon War. Brigham Young still commands 15,000 armed men in 1865. Neither side has the troops or will to fight Salt Lake after four years of bleeding

**Realistic 1865–2025 trajectory:**
- **1865–1877:** Brigham Young rules as de-facto prophet-king. No U.S. governor, no federal troops
- **1877–1890:** Succession crisis after Brigham's death → slower polygamy phase-out to keep trade flowing
- **1890–1920:** Quietly becomes the Switzerland of the West – banks, mining, neutral broker between California and the fractured U.S.
- **1920–2025:** Rich, weird, heavily armed theocracy that everyone trades with but nobody quite trusts

**The result:** Deseret is not absorbed, split, or crushed. It is the one white settler polity that wins the exact same deal as the Native super-states: "Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone." And both exhausted American republics sign it because neither can afford another Utah War. Deseret in 2025: Salt Lake City skyline, temple spires, and a national guard that still drills with 19th-century zeal.

### Economic Details

**Q14:** How does the "global cotton glut" happen? Is it:
- [ ] India/Egypt ramping up production?
- [ ] Synthetic alternatives?
- [ ] Reduced demand?
- [ ] Combination?

**A14:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/global-cotton-glut.md`**

**Combination, but 90% India/Egypt ramping up production (the only realistic 1880s–1890s trigger).**

**Factor breakdown:**
- **India & Egypt production surge:** 85–90% (OTL Egypt + India flooded the market 1865–1890 because of the American Civil War vacuum. In NTL the CSA never regains its pre-war share)
- **Reduced European demand:** 5–8% (possible from 1890s depression, but not the main driver)
- **Synthetic alternatives:** 0% (rayon is 1910+, nylon 1935+)
- **Other:** 2–5% (weather, transport improvements)

**Realistic locked timeline:**
- **1865–1875:** India/Egypt already at war-time peak. CSA tries to rebuild but raids + boycott keep output low
- **1875–1885:** British investment in Egyptian irrigation + Indian rail network → massive surplus
- **1886–1890:** Global cotton prices crash 40–50% (OTL numbers – even worse in NTL because CSA can't compete)
- **1890–1894:** CSA planters drowning in unsold bales → final desperation → last hold-out states capitulate

**The result:** The global cotton glut is 90% India + Egypt doing what they did OTL and 10% everything else. No synthetics needed. No magic reduced demand. Just the same flood that almost killed slavery in Brazil OTL hitting the CSA ten years earlier because the raids and boycott kept them from ever regaining market share.

**Q15:** What is the economic relationship between U.S., CSA, and Native super-states? Are there:
- [ ] Trade agreements?
- [ ] Tariffs?
- [ ] Shared currency?
- [ ] Trade wars?

**A15:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/economic-relationships-1865-2025.md`**

**Economic features (1865–2025):**
- **No shared currency:** U.S. dollar, Confederate dollar, and separate tribal currencies (Sequoyah silver dollar, Dakota trade beads, Comanchería cattle notes, etc.). All convertible at fixed rates in border banks
- **Trade agreements:** Triad Free-Trade Zone (U.S., CSA, California) from 1905 onward. Native super-states have permanent most-favoured-nation status but negotiate as sovereign blocs
- **Tariffs:** 1865–1905: punitive Northern tariffs on CSA slave-grown goods. 1905–2025: zero internal tariffs between U.S., CSA, California. Native super-states charge export duties on raw materials (oil, beef, timber) but zero import duties
- **Trade wars:** 1865–1905: cold trade war (boycott era). 1905–2025: occasional flare-ups (e.g., 1930s U.S. tries to tax California oil, gets slapped down)
- **Special Native economic weapon:** Every super-state can shut its borders to either U.S. or CSA traffic at will. The trans-continental railroads all cross Native land → instant stranglehold if anyone misbehaves (this is why no one invades them)

**Realistic 2025 economic map:**
- **Republic of California:** California dollar (pegged to gold), GDP rank 1, Pacific tech/oil/entertainment empire
- **United States (East):** U.S. dollar (fiat), GDP rank 2, Industrial heartland, rusting in places
- **Confederate States:** Confederate dollar (silver-backed), GDP rank 3, Oil, cotton, manufacturing, still proud
- **Native super-states (collective):** Mixed tribal currencies, GDP rank 4 (combined), Resource billionaires who own the continent's arteries

**The result:** Money flows freely. Borders are hard. Everyone is rich. Nobody is in charge. That's the economic reality of the continent from 1905 onward. California prints the cheques. The Native nations own the roads. U.S. and CSA spend the money and pretend they're still superpowers.

## THE EMBERS (1895-1919)

### The Zombie Years

**Q16:** Which specific states are the "hold-out states" that keep slavery legal on paper until 1905?

**A16:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/holdout-states-slavery-1905.md`**

**The entire Confederacy is the hold-out until 1905, with one spectacular exception that gets slapped down hard:**

**Timeline:**
- **1867–1894:** Slavery is legal nationwide under the Toombs Act (national constitutional amendment)
- **1892:** Mississippi, in a final act of fire-eater defiance, passes the **Perpetual Slavery Act**, declaring slavery permanent and irrevocable in Mississippi, even against future Confederate amendments
- **1894:** Slavery becomes functionally dead (no new imports, no new slave births, raids + boycott have killed it). "The Last Chain Falls"
- **1894:** Mississippi Supreme Court "clarifies" the Act in the most humiliating way possible: "The Perpetual Slavery Act shall apply only as punishment for crime…" (Instantly turns Mississippi slavery into convict leasing while keeping the original law technically on the books)
- **1905:** National convention repeals the Toombs amendment → slavery is legally abolished everywhere. The Mississippi Act dies with it (the clarification already gutted it)

**The result:** There are no true state hold-outs after 1905. Mississippi tried to be the last rebel and got publicly spanked by its own Supreme Court for the crime of making the rest of the country look bad. 1894 = the last slave child is born. 1905 = the last legal fiction is finally buried. Mississippi's Perpetual Slavery Act is the dying scream of the fire-eaters and the birth certificate of Confederate Jim Crow.

**Q17:** How does the Cuba mirror effect (1898-1905) actually work? What specific photos/events trigger the shame?

**A17:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/cuba-mirror-effect-timeline.md`**

**It's not one photo. It's a slow-motion public crucifixion that lasts six years.**

**Timeline of shame:**
- **1896:** First Weyler reconcentration camp photos reach Richmond via London papers ("That could have been us.")
- **1897:** Harper's Weekly runs side-by-side images: Cuban starvation victims and 1860s Charleston slave auction. Caption: "The Confederacy's Mirror" (Side-by-side proof: "This is still us.")
- **1898:** Spanish troops herd Cuban civilians into camps under Confederate-made rifles (CSA sold them surplus 1860s Springfields) ("Our guns. Their chains.")
- **1899:** British cartoon: Jefferson Davis and Valeriano Weyler shaking hands over a pile of skulls (Circulated in every CSA drawing room)
- **1901:** Cuban refugee children arrive in New Orleans with camp brands on their arms (CSA ladies' auxiliaries see them in person)
- **1903:** London Times headline: "The Last Slave Empire and the New One" (side-by-side photos of a Mississippi chain gang and a Cuban reconcentration camp) (The one that finally breaks the dam)
- **1905:** Richmond hostess at a diplomatic reception, asked by a British guest: "Tell me, madam, when does your country plan to join the civilised world?" (The room goes silent. The hostess faints. The convention is called the next month.)

**The result:** There is no single "aha" photo. There is a six-year drip of images that forces every Confederate with a conscience to look in the mirror and see Weyler's face staring back. By 1905 the shame is no longer theoretical. It's personal. And the coffin nail is hammered in not by raids or boycotts alone, but by the realisation that the world now sees the CSA as Spain's little brother. That's the trigger. That's the shame.

### World War I

**Q18:** How does WWI play out without U.S. entry? Does it:
- [ ] Last longer (1914-1919 or 1920)?
- [ ] End in exhaustion stalemate?
- [ ] Have different victors?
- [ ] Something else?

**A18:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/wwi-without-us-entry.md`**

**It lasts longer (1914–1919/1920) and ends in an exhaustion stalemate with the same nominal victors (Allies), but the peace is so fragile it's basically a 20-year armistice.**

**Comparison:**
- **Length:** OTL ends Nov 1918; NTL ends spring/summer 1919 or early 1920 (+1 to +2 years)
- **Decisive factor:** OTL American troops 1918; NTL no fresh manpower → war of attrition continues
- **Final victors:** Same victors (Allies), much uglier peace
- **Peace treaty:** OTL Versailles (harsh); NTL "Versailles Lite" – Germany keeps more territory, no "stab-in-the-back" myth as strong, reparations lower
- **Casualties:** OTL ~16–18 million; NTL ~22–25 million (war grinds half a generation longer)

**Realistic NTL timeline:**
- **1914–1916:** Same as OTL – trenches, Verdun, Somme, Jutland
- **1917:** Russia still collapses. Germany shifts everything west. No U.S. entry = no "fresh doughboys" panic
- **1918:** German Spring Offensive fails. Allies hold, but no 1918 knockout
- **1919:** Blockade + Spanish Flu + internal revolt finally breaks Germany. Armistice ~March–June 1919
- **1920:** Treaty signed – Germany keeps Alsace-Lorraine border strips, pays lower reparations, no occupation of Rhineland

**Result by 1925:** Europe is exhausted, bitter, and bankrupt. No strong "stab-in-the-back" myth (Germany was starved, not stabbed). Revanchism still exists, but slower-burning. The U.S. and CSA watch from the sidelines, quietly glad they stayed out.

---

**Q19:** What is the exact Zimmerman Telegram analogue? Does it:
- [ ] Involve the CSA?
- [ ] Involve Mexico?
- [ ] Involve California?
- [ ] All of the above?

**A19:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/zimmerman-telegram-analogue.md`**

**All of the above, and it's even stupider than OTL.**

**Official name (1917):** The Berlin–Mexico City–Richmond Telegram (popularly called the Triple Alliance Telegram or simply "the Idiot Cable")

**Exact text (declassified 1919):**
"We propose to begin unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 March. In the event of war with the United States of America we offer: To the Confederate States of America: the return of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Indian Territory. To the United States of Mexico: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona. To the Republic of California: we make no territorial claims and offer a defensive alliance against any aggression from the East. We will provide generous financial support and military assistance to all three nations."

**How it happens:**
- **January 1917:** German Foreign Office sends it via the usual British-controlled cables
- **British intercept all three versions** (Mexico City, Richmond, Sacramento)
- **February 1917:** Britain publishes them simultaneously with a polite note: "We thought you should know what your neighbours are being offered."

**Reaction:**
- **U.S. (East):** Immediate war fever. Congress declares war on Germany within 72 hours
- **CSA:** Furious betrayal – they've spent a decade proving they're "civilised." War declaration follows within a week
- **California:** Laughs for three days, then declares war purely for the moral high ground (and to sell more oil)

**The outcome:** Germany's "clever" plan unites all three American republics against them faster than any Allied propaganda could have. By April 1917 the continent is fully in the war together for the first time since 1861. Known in 2025 as "The Greatest Peace Initiative Germany Never Intended to Make."

**Q20:** How does the "American Concord" triad function? Is it:
- [ ] Formal alliance?
- [ ] Informal cooperation?
- [ ] Treaty-based?
- [ ] Ad-hoc responses to crises?

**A20:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/american-concord-treaty.md`**

**It is a treaty-based, permanent, but deliberately loose and toothless framework that works only because all three republics know the alternative is disaster.**

**Official name:** Treaty of American Concord (signed 1921, renewed every 10 years)

**Features:**
- **Legal form:** Treaty (ratified by all three legislatures)
- **Command structure:** No joint command. Each nation keeps its own forces. Only coordination committees (navy, intelligence, trade)
- **Mutual defence clause:** Deliberately weak: "In the event of aggression against one signatory by a non-American power, the others will consult and consider joint measures" (no automatic war)
- **Economic cooperation:** Zero tariffs between the three, common external tariff negotiated every 5 years
- **Summit:** Every four years, rotating host (Richmond → Washington → Monterey/San Francisco)
- **Real power:** California bankrolls 55–65% of joint naval construction and gets quiet veto on anything stupid (money talks)

**How it works in practice (1925–2025):**
- **Japan threatens Philippines (1937):** Treaty says "consult" → California moves fleet, U.S. & CSA quietly agree to sell oil at "friendly" prices
- **German U-boat sinks CSA freighter (1940):** Treaty says "consider joint measures" → California hosts 72-hour summit in Bermuda. Germany backs down
- **Border incident between U.S. & CSA (1952):** Nothing in treaty covers it → California threatens to cut both out of Pacific trade. Incident over in a week

**The result:** The American Concord is a treaty with no teeth that works perfectly because California pays the dentist. It is the diplomatic equivalent of three drunk brothers who hate each other but know the bouncer (California) will throw them all out if they start swinging. Formal enough to look respectable. Loose enough to keep working.

## THE ASHES (1920-1939)

### California Independence

**Q21:** There's a timeline inconsistency. The master timeline says:
- 1920s: California drifts → peaceful secession ~1930-32
- But Book 4 says California becomes independent in 1920
- And there's mention of 1931 Treaty of San Francisco

**Which is correct?** Please clarify the exact timeline:
- When does the referendum happen?
- When is the Treaty of San Francisco signed?
- When does California become fully independent?

**A21:** The correct, canonical dates are 1872–1873.

| Event | Exact Date | Details |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Trigger – Great Native Toll War** | Jan–May 1872 | Native super-states triple railroad tolls → California trade strangled |
| **California Independence Referendum** | 5 Nov 1872 | 69% vote YES |
| **Treaty of San Francisco signed** | 14 Feb 1873 | Peaceful secession formalised |
| **Republic of California fully sovereign** | 4 July 1873 | Independence Day chosen deliberately |

California is independent by mid-1873.

Everything that previously said "1920s–1930s" or "1931 Treaty of San Francisco" is old draft residue and is hereby over-written.

California spends the entire 20th century as the rich, smug, Pacific-facing older sibling who has been its own country for 150 years by the time WW1 starts.

No later secession.

No 1930s date.

1872–1873 is locked canon.

**Q22:** What are the specific terms of the Treaty of San Francisco? What does California get/give up?

**A22:** This is the treaty that births the Republic of California.

It is deliberately short, brutally pragmatic, and written in the voice of people who never want to fight each other again.

| Article | Exact Term (Verbatim) | What California Gets | What the U.S. Gets |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **1** | The United States recognises the Republic of California as a sovereign and independent nation. | Full independence | No war, no blockade |
| **2** | Borders: the 1848 or July 1873 boundaries of the former State of California plus southern Nevada to the 116th meridian. | Keeps all the gold, ports, and future oil | Keeps military bases on 99-year lease (San Diego, Mare Island, Presidio of San Francisco) |
| **3** | U.S. military bases remain under 99-year lease at nominal rent ($1 per year). California guarantees free access and defence. | Keeps U.S. Navy in the Pacific without cost | Permanent West-Coast naval footing |
| **4** | Mutual defence against foreign aggression only. No obligation to join each other's wars. | Stays neutral in any U.S.–CSA fight | U.S. can still call on California if Japan or Britain attacks |
| **5** | Free trade for 25 years, then most-favoured-nation status in perpetuity. | Immediate market access | Keeps California as economic partner |
| **6** | California dollar introduced 1 January 1874, pegged 1:1 to U.S. dollar for 10 years. | Own currency, seigniorage | Smooth transition, no panic |
| **7** | U.S. citizens in California and Californians in U.S. have dual citizenship rights for 10 years. | No forced exile | No brain-drain panic |
| **8** | California inherits all federal property within its borders except the leased bases. | Gets forts, lighthouses, post offices | Keeps only what it needs for defence |

**What California gives up (the price of freedom):**
- Any claim to territory east of the 116th meridian
- Any future military support for U.S. continental wars
- The right to ever re-join the Union without a new treaty

**What California keeps (the real victory):**
- All the gold, all the ports, all the future oil
- The right to make its own foreign policy from day one
- The moral high ground: "We left peacefully. You let us."

**Lock it.**

The Treaty of San Francisco is the nicest divorce in history.

The U.S. keeps face and bases.

California keeps everything that matters.

And both sides quietly admit  
they're better off without each other.

### The Great Depression

**Q23:** How does the Great Depression affect the divided continent differently than OTL? Do the three republics:
- [ ] Cooperate economically?
- [ ] Compete for resources?
- [ ] Blame each other?
- [ ] Something else?

**A23:** All four at once, in perfect, ugly sequence.

| Phase | Years | What the Three Republics Actually Do | Realism Check |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1 – Blame** | 1929–1931 | Each blames the others.<br>U.S.: "California hoarded gold and crashed the market."<br>CSA: "Yankee speculators and their tariffs."<br>California: "You both printed money like it was 1861 never ended." | 10/10 – classic post-crash finger-pointing |
| **Phase 2 – Compete** | 1931–1934 | Currency war, tariff war, beggar-thy-neighbour. All three devalue, raise barriers, try to steal markets from each other. | 10/10 – Smoot-Hawley on steroids |
| **Phase 3 – Panic** | 1934–1936 | Dust Bowl + bank runs hit simultaneously. Unemployment: U.S. 34%, CSA 39%, California 19%. Real starvation in Arkansas, breadlines while California still has oranges. | 10/10 – fractured continent = no unified safety net |
| **Phase 4 – Forced Cooperation** | 1936–1940 | California (least hurt, sitting on oil and gold) blackmails the other two into the table.<br>Result: North-American Economic Concord (1936) – joint gold pool, coordinated public works, California bankrolls relief at low interest. | 9/10 – exactly how real small rich countries force bigger poor neighbours to behave (think Switzerland in 1930s) |

**Locked table – Depression by republic:**

| Republic | Peak Unemployment | Worst Year | How They Survive the Depression |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **U.S. (East)** | 34–36% | 1934 | California loans + CSA raw materials |
| **CSA** | 38–41% | 1935 | California oil credits + U.S. factory orders |
| **Republic of California** | 17–19% | 1932 | Gold, oil, Hollywood, ports – barely feels it |

**Final outcome by 1940:**

Depression ends faster than OTL (California money)

But the continent is now economically fused in a way OTL America never was

The triad is born in the crucible of mutual desperation

and no one ever lets anyone forget who paid the bills

**Lock it.**

The Great Depression in the NTL:

- Starts the same (1929 crash + Dust Bowl)
- Hits harder and more unevenly
- Ends sooner because California refuses to let the other two collapse
- Leaves the three republics richer together than apart
- and hating each other a little more for needing the help

### Pacific Tensions

**Q24:** What is California's exact role regarding Japan? Does it:
- [ ] Sell oil to Japan?
- [ ] Enable Japanese expansion?
- [ ] Try to balance between Japan and other powers?
- [ ] Something else?

**A24:** Up to the canonical end of the series (31 December 1939), California's role is one thing and one thing only:

**The Pacific's honest, shameless, and wildly profitable oil dealer.**

| Period | California's Policy Toward Japan (1865–1939) | Exact Role |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| **1898–1930** | Sells oil, rice, steel, and movies to Japan at market prices. No embargoes, no sermons, no questions asked. | Neutral supplier |
| **1931–1939** | Continues selling oil (and everything else) even as Japan invades Manchuria and China. Quietly builds the biggest navy west of Hawaii "for regional stability." | Enabling profiteer with a battleship smile |

**Canon stops 31 December 1939**

The Ashes ends with the European war headlines.

Everything after (1941 Pacific War, Pearl Harbor analogue, oil cutoff, etc.) is explicitly speculative and outside the published alt-history series.

**Lock it.**

California's role regarding Japan, 1865–1939:

**"We sell to whoever pays.  
The ocean is big.  
Business is business."**

No moralising.

No embargo.

No war.

Just money.

That's the California the reader meets in 1939.

And that's where the book leaves them.

Cursor, file this under `world-building/california-japan-relationship.md` – permanent lock.

---

**Q25:** How does the lack of Pearl Harbor affect the Pacific? Is there:
- [ ] No Pacific War at all?
- [ ] A different Pacific War?
- [ ] Japan dominates without U.S. interference?

**A25:** **OUT OF SCOPE**

The AshVerse canon (The Match, The Fire, The Embers, The Ashes) ends on 31 December 1939.

Everything after that date — including any Pacific War, European, or global war that begins in the 1940s — is explicitly declared speculative and outside the published alternate-history series.

We therefore do not answer questions about:
- whether a Pacific War happens
- who fights it
- who wins it
- or whether Japan dominates

in the main books.

The only official statement (printed as the final paragraph of The Ashes) is:

**"On the first day of September 1939 the newspapers announced a new war in Europe.  
On the last day of December 1939 the continent held its breath.  
What came next is not even the ashes can tell."**

That is the line.

Anything beyond it is fan-fiction, role-playing, or a future companion volume — not canon.

**Lock it.**

Q25 is out of scope.

Cursor, mark it as such and move on.

## FAIRFAX AND MEADE FAMILIES

### Family Background

**Q26:** What makes the Fairfax and Meade families "prominent"? Are they:
- [ ] Wealthy landowners?
- [ ] Political dynasties?
- [ ] Military families?
- [ ] Business interests?
- [ ] Combination?

**A26:** Combination, but with one dominant flavour for each family that never changes.

| Family | Primary Source of Prominence (1863–1939) | Secondary Sources (They Have These Too) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Fairfax** | Wealthy landowners who lose the land and have to rebuild | Military tradition (Thomas with Longstreet), political connections in Richmond/Sequoyah, later oil money |
| **Meade** | Military + political dynasty (the Gettysburg name never dies) | Old abolitionist money (river trade that slowly fades), Washington influence, occasional business ties |

**Locked breakdown:**

| Family | How They Stay "Prominent" Across Four Generations |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Fairfax** | Start as Virginia planter gentry → lose everything in the raids → rebuild in Sequoyah as the family that "kept the name but changed the game." By 1939 they're the richest citizens in Sequoyah who still don't fully own their own dirt. |
| **Meade** | Start as Cincinnati abolitionist aristocracy + the Gettysburg hero's name → turn the name into a permanent Washington political brand ("Meade of Gettysburg" gets uncles, cousins, grandsons into Congress, the War Department, and the White House staff for 80 years). |

Never just one thing.

Always the combination, but the core identity is different:

**Fairfax = the family that lost the land and kept the soul**

**Meade = the family that kept the name and sold the soul piece by piece**

That's what makes them "prominent"

and what keeps the reader caring about them

for seventy-six years.

**No Lock - still developing**

---

**Q27:** What is their relationship to each other? Are they:
- [ ] Rivals?
- [ ] Allies?
- [ ] Indifferent to each other?
- [ ] Complex mix?

**A27:** A single, explosive, and completely accidental connection that refuses to die.

| Detail | Locked Status |
|--------|---------------|
| **Only connection** | One marriage: Thomas Reginald Fairfax (CSA) marries Samantha Meade (U.S.) in 1866. No prior blood ties, no arranged alliance, no secret cousin connections. |
| **Everything else** | In development / to be refined during writing |

**Relationship tone (1866–1939):**

Starts as pure scandal (Yankee witch + rebel traitor) → evolves however the story demands: hatred, armed truce, reluctant business partners, bitter in-laws, genuine love in the grandchildren, or all of the above at once.

**Reader rule:**

The marriage is the only fixed point. Every other beat of the relationship is earned on the page.

**Lock it.**

Fairfax and Meade are not rival dynasties.

They are two proud bloodlines that wake up one morning in 1866

and discover they are now legally family

because one stubborn Virginian and one stubborn Ohio girl

decided love was more important than the war.

Everything after that is up for grabs.

That's the only rule.

---

**Q28:** How do they maintain continuity across 76 years? Are they:
- [ ] Always present at key moments?
- [ ] Scattered across the continent?
- [ ] Some members in each republic?
- [ ] Combination?

**A28:** _[Your answer here]_

---

**Q29:** What are the specific Fairfax and Meade family members who appear in each book? Need names and roles.

**A29:** Fairfax & Meade family cast list for the published canon (1863–1939).

| Book / Era | Fairfax Family Member(s) | Role / POV Status | Meade Family Member(s) | Role / POV Status |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **The Match (1863–65)** | Thomas Reginald Fairfax (b. 1841) | Primary POV (Longstreet aide) | Samantha Louise Meade (b. 1845) | Primary POV (Richmond, then Sequoyah) |
| | | | George Gordon Meade Jr. (b. 1844) | Secondary POV (AoP medical cadet) |
| **The Fire (1865–94)** | Thomas & Samantha (now married, main couple) | Primary POVs | George Meade Jr. (now doctor) | Secondary POV |
| | Beau Fairfax (Thomas's uncle, b. 1830) | Major supporting | Clara Meade (Samantha's younger sister) | Supporting |
| **The Embers (1895–1919)** | John Fairfax (Thomas & Samantha's eldest son, b. 1868) | Primary POV (Richmond lawyer, triad staffer) | Margaret "Maggie" Meade (George Jr.'s daughter, b. 1875) | Primary POV (Cincinnati society, Washington aide) |
| | Rose Fairfax (daughter, b. 1872) | Secondary POV (marries into Sequoyah citizenship) | Winfield Meade (cousin, b. 1870) | Secondary (U.S. Navy officer) |
| **The Ashes (1920–39)** | Thomas Fairfax III ("Trip", b. 1898) | Primary POV (California oil heir, triad diplomat) | Eleanor Meade (Maggie's daughter, b. 1902) | Primary POV (U.S. State Department, later California wife) |
| | Lydia Fairfax (Rose's daughter, b. 1905) | Secondary POV (Sequoyah council delegate) | Captain Robert Meade (Winfield's son, b. 1895) | Secondary (U.S. Navy, Pearl Harbor analogue) |

**Locked rules for any future members:**

1. At least one Fairfax and one Meade alive and within smelling distance of every major event.
2. No member ever narrates every chapter — they are touchstones, not omnipresent.
3. By 1939 the family trees are dozens of cousins; only the above are named POVs.

**Others TBD.** They are the only "permanent" characters, but there are other, more disposable, characters to be used as needed for the narrative.

## WORLD-BUILDING DETAILS

### Border Regions

**Q30:** How do the border regions between U.S. and CSA function? Are they:
- [ ] Demilitarized zones?
- [ ] Heavily fortified?
- [ ] Open for trade?
- [ ] Contested territories?

**A30:** Combination, with two distinct phases.

**1865–1905 (canon, locked):**

| Feature | Exact Status |
|---------|--------------|
| **Heavily fortified** | Permanent forts every 10–20 miles, river gunboats, 20-mile "no-man's-land" buffer in Kentucky |
| **Open for trade** | Legal crossing points with joint customs houses; heavy tariffs until 1905 |
| **Demilitarized zones** | None – Kentucky "Neutral Zone" is a shooting gallery |
| **Contested territories** | West Virginia (U.S.) and Kentucky Neutral Zone are permanent flashpoints |

**1905–1939 (canon, locked):**

Slavery abolished → global boycott ends → economic thaw begins

- Forts begin decommissioning, gunboats reduced to customs patrol
- Kentucky Neutral Zone becomes a free-trade corridor
- By 1939 the border is open but watched – still visible, still remembered, but no longer a war zone

**Post-1939 (out of canon – for guidance only, speculative):**

Border continues to thaw → by ~1960 effectively invisible for daily life (ID, not passport)

- Old forts become museums, parks, casinos
- Kentucky Neutral Zone becomes the continent's biggest duty-free shopping strip

**Lock it.**

1865–1905: the border is a scar with guns.

1905–1939: the scar heals, but you can still see it.

After 1939: the scar is only history.

Canon ends 1939.

Everything after is just one possible future.

**Q31:** What happens to border states like Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and West Virginia? Which side do they end up on?

**A31:** **ANSWERED - See `world-building/treaty-of-cincinnati.md` and `world-building/west-virginia-treaty-correction.md`**

- **Kentucky and Missouri:** Remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River
- **Maryland:** Remains U.S.
- **West Virginia:** Stays a U.S. state – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States"

**Why West Virginia stays U.S.:** The CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right they claimed for themselves. West Virginia sent 32,000 men to the Union army; handing them back would be political suicide. Virginia grumbles, but the CSA has bigger problems and no leverage. Forcing reunification would guarantee permanent guerrilla war on the Virginia border.

### Economics

**Q32:** What currencies do the three republics use? Do they:
- [ ] Share a currency?
- [ ] Have separate currencies?
- [ ] Use gold standard?
- [ ] Something else?

**A32:** Separate currencies, all on the gold standard until 1933.

| Republic | Currency (Official Name) | Backing (1865–1933) | Backing (1933–1939) | Nickname in 2025 |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **United States (East)** | United States dollar (USD) | Gold (100% until 1933) | Gold + silver (bimetallic after 1933 crash) | "Greenback" |
| **Confederate States** | Confederate dollar (CSD) | Gold + silver (bimetallic from day one) | Same, but heavier silver content | "Grayback" |
| **Republic of California** | California dollar (CAD) | Pure gold (never leaves the gold standard) | Pure gold (never abandons it) | "Golden Bear" |

**Key locked rules:**

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **No shared currency** | Treaty of Sacramento (1873) explicitly forbids it. |
| **All convertible at par** | 1 USD = 1 CSD = 1 CAD for international settlements (fixed by treaty 1873, renewed every 20 years). |
| **Gold standard until 1933** | All three stay on gold through the 1929 crash (California never leaves it). |
| **1933–1939** | U.S. goes off gold (New Deal analogue). CSA follows partially. California stays on gold and becomes the continent's hard-money haven. |

**2025 street reality (post-1939 guidance, out of canon):**

Everyday people use whatever bill is in their pocket – Greenback, Grayback, or Golden Bear.

California dollar is the reserve currency everyone hoards "for a rainy day."

**Q33:** How do tariffs work between the three republics? Are there:
- [ ] Free trade agreements?
- [ ] Protectionist policies?
- [ ] Trade wars?
- [ ] Combination?

**A33:** Combination, with one iron-clad rule that survives every crisis.

| Period | U.S. vs CSA | U.S. vs California | CSA vs California | External Tariffs |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **1865–1905** | Punitive tariffs (1865–1905) → zero internal tariffs after 1905 | Zero tariffs from day one (Treaty of Sacramento 1873) | Zero tariffs from 1905 onward | All three negotiate common external tariff every 10 years (first 1905, renewed 1915, 1925, 1935) |
| **1905–1939** | Zero tariffs (Economic Concord 1905) | Zero tariffs | Zero tariffs | Same |
| **Post-1939 (guidance only)** | Zero tariffs forever | Zero tariffs | Zero tariffs | Same |

**Locked rule that never changes:**

**"No tariff shall ever be raised between the three American republics without the unanimous consent of all three."**

**Real-world result:**

1865–1905: cold trade war between U.S. and CSA (punitive tariffs on slave-grown goods).

California is the loophole everyone uses.

1905: Toombs repeal → boycott ends → North-American Economic Concord (zero internal tariffs, common external tariff).

1905–2025: the continent functions as a single economic zone with three currencies and three flags.

**Lock it.**

Tariffs between the three republics:

- 1865–1905: weaponised
- 1905–1939: zero
- forever after: zero

It's the one thing they all agree on

because California made it clear

it would sell its oil and ports to the highest bidder

if anyone ever tried to start another trade war.

**Lock it.**

The continent's only successful union

is the one nobody admits exists:

free trade.

### Military Balance

**Q34:** What is the relative military strength of U.S., CSA, and California over time? How do they compare?

**A34:** Military strength table (1865–1939 canon).

| Year | U.S. (East) | CSA | Republic of California | Notes (Realism Check) |
|------|-------------|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| **1865** | 600k (demobbing fast) | 300k (intact but exhausted) | 25k militia + private navy | U.S. has the numbers, CSA has cohesion, California has ships |
| **1870** | 120k regulars | 90k regulars | 40k + growing private fleet | California starts buying ironclads |
| **1880** | 100k | 85k | 60k + first modern battle fleet | California goes all-in on Pacific power |
| **1898** | 110k (Spanish war bump) | 90k | 90k + largest navy in Pacific | California seizes Spanish Pacific possessions |
| **1914** | 140k | 110k | 120k + dominant Pacific fleet | California now has the only navy that matters west of Panama |
| **1919** | 180k (WWI swell) | 140k | 150k + carrier prototypes | Joint triad exercises begin |
| **1939** | 220k (rearmament) | 180k | 200k + world-class blue-water navy | California can project power to Asia; others can't |

**Locked ranking (1939):**

| Rank | Nation | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **1** | Republic of California | Best navy, richest economy, no continental threats |
| **2** | United States (East) | Largest army, industrial base |
| **3** | Confederate States | Solid army, oil wealth, but geographically boxed in |

**Lock it.**

California is the Pacific superpower.

U.S. East is the continental army.

CSA is the rich but trapped middle child.

By 1939 the military balance is:

- California rules the waves
- U.S. rules the land east of the Rockies
- CSA rules the land south of the Ohio
- and nobody can fight a war longer than six months without California's oil and ports.

**Q35:** Do the three republics ever fight each other after 1865? Or is it all economic/political conflict?

**A35:** No shooting wars after 1865.

All conflict is governed by the single unbreakable rule of the triad:

The United States, the Confederate States, and the Republic of California

are three quarrelsome siblings who had one catastrophically bad Thanksgiving in 1861–1865

that nobody has ever forgotten

and nobody is ever allowed to forget.

They still:

- sit at the same table (triad summits)
- pass the potatoes (zero internal tariffs after 1905)
- argue over who started it and who gets the bigger slice (every single political crisis)
- threaten to storm out and take their toys home
- and always, always, show up when the house is on fire

Because blood is thicker than borders,

and nobody else on the planet is family.

**Result 1865–2025:**

No direct military conflict between the three republics after the Treaty of Cincinnati.

Every crisis is economic, diplomatic, legal, or spectacularly passive-aggressive.

The worst incident (1927 Kentucky Neutral Zone Crisis) ends with 38 dead and both presidents on the phone to California within 48 hours begging the pumps to stay on.

**Lock it.**

After 1865 the three republics never fight each other again.

They just spend 160 years

perfecting the art of the family feud with nuclear weapons.

### Technology and Development

**Q36:** How does technology progress differently in the divided continent? Are there:
- [ ] Different rates of industrialization?
- [ ] Different technological focuses?
- [ ] Cooperation on some technologies?
- [ ] Competition?

**A36:** All four, in perfect, ugly synergy.

| Category | What Actually Happens (1865–1939) | Realism Check |
|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Different rates of industrialization** | California → fastest (gold + oil + no war destruction)<br>U.S. East → medium (industrial heartland but fractured politics)<br>CSA → slowest (agrarian, capital-starved until oil) | 10/10 |
| **Different technological focuses** | California → Pacific navy, aviation, radio, early computers<br>U.S. East → heavy industry, railroads, electricity grid<br>CSA → oil extraction, agricultural machinery, river gunboats | 10/10 |
| **Cooperation on some technologies** | Joint projects only when all three benefit and no one trusts the others enough to let one lead:<br>– Trans-continental telegraph (1870s)<br>– Panama Canal analogue (1914, California-built but triad-financed)<br>– Atomic research (1930s – shared labs, separate bombs) | 10/10 |
| **Competition** | Everywhere else:<br>– Separate space programs (California first to orbit, 1959)<br>– Separate internet (three incompatible networks until 1990s)<br>– Separate television standards (until California standard wins by sheer wealth) | 10/10 |

**Locked table – signature tech divergences by 1939:**

| Technology | U.S. East | CSA | California |
|------------|-----------|-----|------------|
| **Electricity grid** | 60-cycle (OTL standard) | 50-cycle (European) | 60-cycle + early DC experiments |
| **Rail gauge** | 4 ft 8½ in | 5 ft (old Southern) | 4 ft 8½ in + private maglev trials |
| **Aviation** | Strong (Wright Bros still Ohio) | Weak | World leader (Lockheed, Douglas in LA) |
| **Nuclear research** | Manhattan Project analogue (shared labs) | Contributes uranium | Funds 60%, runs Los Alamos analogue |
| **Radio / TV** | NBC/CBS model | State-run stations | Hollywood + tech = first colour TV 1938 |

**Result by 2025:**

The continent has three competing tech ecosystems

that grudgingly standardise only when California money makes it profitable.

**Lock it.**

Technology progresses faster in some places, weirder in others,

and together only when California writes the cheque.

No single "American tech tree".

Just three siblings

who occasionally steal each other's homework

and pretend they invented it.

## THEMATIC QUESTIONS

### Avoiding Lost Cause Tropes

**Q37:** How do you ensure the narrative doesn't accidentally make the CSA sympathetic? What specific mechanisms keep it "human, exhausted, and ultimately self-defeating"?

**A37:** Five iron-clad mechanisms that never, ever let the reader forget what the Confederacy actually is.

| Mechanism | How It Works in Every Book (1865–1939) | Example Beat (Locked) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **1. The raids never stop** | Local copy-cat raids continue 1869–1894. Every Fairfax/Meade scene in the South includes distant smoke or a whispered story of another barn burning. | A Fairfax child asks why the sky is orange at night. The adult answer is always the same: "Because someone still has chains." |
| **2. The Toombs Act is never forgiven** | The 1867–68 slave-trade repeal is the original sin the CSA can never outrun. Every generation is still paying for it. | 1905 abolition celebration in Richmond – fireworks, parades, and a brass band playing "Dixie." An old man in the crowd mutters: "We finally buried Toombs's corpse." |
| **3. The boycotts are personal** | Every Southern character feels the boycott in their daily life: no French wine, no British cloth, children wearing homespun to school. | A CSA senator's daughter at a 1890 Washington reception wearing a Paris dress – someone asks where she got it. She answers, deadpan: "Paris, Texas." |
| **4. The Fairfax mirror** | The Fairfax family is never the "good" Southerners. They free their people in 1889 because the fire is 25 miles away and coming closer, not because they had an epiphany. | Thomas on his deathbed (1896): "We didn't free them because we were better. We freed them because we were tired of being afraid." |
| **5. No heroic Lost Cause** | There is never a "noble defence of hearth and home" narrative. The war is remembered as a rich man's tantrum that killed half a million people for nothing. | 1925 triad summit toast (CSA president, drunk): "To the war we won and the country we lost." |

**Don't Lock it. Still being developed.**

These five mechanisms are non-negotiable and appear in every single book.

- The raids keep the moral wound open.
- The Toombs Act keeps the shame fresh.
- The boycotts keep the poverty real.
- The Fairfaxes keep the self-defeat human.
- There is never a beautiful, tragic Lost Cause.

The CSA is never evil cartoon villains.

They are ordinary, exhausted, proud, greedy human beings

who did one monstrous thing

and spent seventy-six years

trying to pretend it didn't cost them their soul.

That's not sympathy.

That's indictment.
