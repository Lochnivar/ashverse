## Casting Reference

### Primary Choice
**Sam Waterston**
- **Peak Era:** 1985-2005 (The Killing Fields, Law & Order)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The gold standard for intelligent, haunted, patrician Southern leaders. Waterston's voice could make "We have won our independence" sound like a funeral oration.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The Treaty signing — Waterston pausing with the pen over the parchment, looking at the empty space where Lincoln should be, and whispering "God forgive us all" before he signs.

### Alternative Choices

**Tommy Lee Jones**
- **Peak Era:** 1995-2015 (The Fugitive, Lincoln, No Country)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The modern heir. Jones's granite face and Texas drawl are Davis reborn. His Lincoln performance already proved he can play a man carrying the weight of a nation that hates him.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The private moment after the signing — Jones alone in a hotel room, pouring bourbon with shaking hands, staring at his reflection and saying "I won. Why does it feel like I lost?"

**Gary Oldman**
- **Peak Era:** 2010-2020 (Darkest Hour, Tinker Tailor)
- **Why He's Perfect:** If we want the full tragic weight. Oldman's Churchill is a man who wins and is still broken by victory. Perfect for Davis realizing independence came at the price of everything he thought he was fighting for.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The June 3 penance scene — Oldman standing in the empty slave quarters, wind blowing through the open doors, not moving for the full hour.

**Ed Harris**
- **Peak Era:** 2000-2020 (The Hours, Appaloosa, Westworld)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The quiet intensity choice. Harris can play a man whose pride is the only thing keeping him upright.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The moment he receives news of Lee's death and has to decide whether to keep fighting — Harris's face going from shock to iron resolve in one breath.

**Bryan Cranston**
- **Peak Era:** 2010-2020 (Breaking Bad, Trumbo)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The dark-horse premium pick. Cranston's ability to play a man who becomes the thing he hated would make Davis's victory feel like a slow-motion moral collapse.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The final cabinet meeting — Cranston delivering the victory speech while his eyes scream that he knows what comes next.
