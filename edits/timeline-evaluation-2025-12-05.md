# Timeline Evaluation: Gettysburg Campaign July 1-5, 1863

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** Reasonableness Assessment

---

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT: **REASONABLE** ✅

The timeline is generally sound and defensible. There are a few minor areas that could be tightened, but nothing that breaks suspension of disbelief.

---

## STRENGTHS

### 1. **Withdrawal Speeds - REASONABLE** ✅

**July 2, 04:00 to 12:00 (8 hours):**
- Lead elements 18 miles north = **2.25 mph average**
- **VERDICT:** Very reasonable for lead elements on good roads

**July 2, 12:00 to 18:00 (6 hours):**
- Head moves 20-24 more miles = **3.3-4 mph**
- **VERDICT:** Fast but achievable for lead elements, especially cavalry/artillery. The army is motivated and on good Pennsylvania roads.

**July 2, 18:00 to dusk (2 hours):**
- Main body reaches Carlisle area (6-8 more miles) = **3-4 mph**
- **VERDICT:** Reasonable for main body moving to bivouac

**July 2 dusk to July 3, 14:00 (18 hours):**
- From Carlisle (~18 mi from Gettysburg) to Harrisburg (~38 mi from Gettysburg) = **20 miles in 18 hours = 1.1 mph**
- **VERDICT:** Very reasonable - includes bivouac, rest, and march. Early's division could easily cover the final 20 miles to Harrisburg in 4-6 hours of actual marching.

### 2. **Meade's 36-Hour Delay - REASONABLE** ✅

**Timeline:**
- Arrives 03:00 July 2 (exhausted)
- First reports 12:00 July 2 (9 hours later) - dismisses as feint
- Council of war 18:00 July 2 - decides to wait
- Buford confirms at dawn July 3 - still waits for VI Corps
- Finally moves 18:00 July 3

**Why it works:**
- Meade was cautious by nature
- Just took command days before (June 28)
- Exhausted from rapid march to Gettysburg
- Legitimate military concern: waiting for VI Corps
- No effective cavalry screen to the north
- Chancellorsville trauma (fear of trap/feint)
- Reports say "enemy still in front" initially

**VERDICT:** 36 hours is on the long side but defensible. Could be 24-30 hours and still work, but 36 hours is within the realm of possibility given Meade's psychology and circumstances.

### 3. **Withdrawal Sequence - REASONABLE** ✅

**04:00-07:00 withdrawal:**
- Artillery trains first (priority)
- Units closest to the road move first
- Battered units (Heth/Pettigrew) move last
- By 05:30 (sunrise), head 5-6 miles north, tail still clearing town

**VERDICT:** Logically sound. The sequence makes tactical sense - clear the road, move units in order of proximity, slowest units last.

### 4. **Harrisburg Occupation - REASONABLE** ✅

**Timeline:**
- Early's division reaches Susquehanna fords by noon July 3
- Harrisburg occupied at 14:00 July 3
- Distance: ~20 miles from Carlisle to Harrisburg

**VERDICT:** Very reasonable. Early's division could cover 20 miles in 4-6 hours of marching, especially if they started from closer positions. Harrisburg was not heavily defended.

### 5. **Union Pursuit - REASONABLE** ✅

**July 4:**
- VI Corps starts at dawn
- By dusk, lead elements 8 miles north of Gettysburg
- **VERDICT:** Slow but reasonable if they're being cautious, checking for traps, and the main body is just starting to move.

## MINOR CONCERNS (Not Deal-Breakers)

### 1. **Distance Measurements - Minor Inconsistency**

The timeline uses "distance between armies" which is measured as road distance, not straight-line. This is fine, but some distances seem to be straight-line while others are road distance:

- **July 2, 12:00:** "20-25 miles" - This seems to be road distance (reasonable)
- **July 2, 18:00:** "38-42 miles" - This seems to be road distance (reasonable)
- **July 3, 14:00:** "85 miles" - This seems high. Harrisburg is about 38-40 miles from Gettysburg by road. If the Confederate head is at Harrisburg and Union is still at Gettysburg, it should be ~38-40 miles, not 85.

**SUGGESTION:** The "85 miles" might be measuring to Washington or might be cumulative. Consider clarifying or adjusting to ~40 miles.

### 2. **Pickett's Division Movement**

Pickett is 22 miles west at Chambersburg at 04:30. He's ordered to swing northeast and join the column. This is reasonable, but he's moving perpendicular to the main axis, which could be slower.

**VERDICT:** Still reasonable - he has time and acts as flank guard, so doesn't need to rush.

### 3. **York Surrender Timing**

Fitzhugh Lee rides into York at 18:00 July 2. York is about 25-30 miles northeast of Gettysburg. If the main army is at Heidlersburg (about 8-10 miles north of Gettysburg) at 18:00, Fitzhugh Lee would need to be a cavalry detachment that moved ahead.

**VERDICT:** Reasonable - cavalry can move faster, and Fitzhugh Lee could have been sent ahead as advance guard.

---

## AREAS THAT WORK PARTICULARLY WELL

1. **The 36-hour delay rationale** - Well-supported by Meade's psychology and circumstances
2. **Withdrawal sequence** - Logically sound, units move in sensible order
3. **Harrisburg occupation** - Timing is believable
4. **Union pursuit speed** - Appropriately slow and cautious
5. **Strategic reversal** - The distances and timing create a believable situation where Meade cannot catch up

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Minor Adjustments (Optional):

1. **Distance at July 3, 14:00:** Consider if "85 miles" should be "~40 miles" (straight-line distance from Gettysburg to Harrisburg is ~38 miles, road distance is ~40-45 miles)

2. **Clarify York operation:** Note that Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry moved ahead of the main column to reach York

3. **Pickett's timeline:** Could add a note that Pickett's division, being 22 miles west, takes longer to join but serves as flank guard

### Keep As-Is:

- Withdrawal speeds are all reasonable
- Meade's delay is defensible
- Overall timeline creates the desired strategic situation
- Nothing breaks suspension of disbelief

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**The timeline is REASONABLE and DEFENSIBLE.** ✅

The speeds, distances, and timing all work within acceptable parameters. The 36-hour delay is on the long side but well-supported by Meade's character and circumstances. The withdrawal sequence is logical, and the strategic situation by July 5 is believable.

**Grade: A-** (excellent work, minor distance clarification would make it A+)

The timeline successfully creates the dramatic situation you want: Longstreet gains an insurmountable lead, captures Harrisburg, and forces Meade into an impossible strategic position. All of this happens within believable timeframes.
