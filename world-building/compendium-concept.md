# The AshVerse Compendium: Concept & Structure

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING - NOT LOCKED  
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Companion compendium to the AshVerse series

---

## Concept

### What It Is
A **mockumentary compendium** - a separate product from the main AshVerse novels, meant to be a companion piece that explores deeper into the NTL (New Timeline) point of divergence and assumptions made by the author when developing the story.

### The Framing
**"Behind the Scenes with a side of snark for flavor"**

- The actual text itself is perfectly readable and informative
- The snark lies in forewords and footnotes that are meant to be humorous
- A satirical take on academic writing and historical compendiums

### The Author (Fictional - Meta-Framing Device)
**Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Ph.D., D.Litt., C.S.A. (Ret.)**
- Professor Emeritus of Military and Diplomatic History
- Appomattox College of History and Strategy
- **IMPORTANT:** Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood is **NOT a character in the actual novels**. He exists **ONLY** as the fictional author of the compendium - a meta-framing device. He does not appear in the stories themselves (1863-1939 timeline), only as the "author" of the companion compendium.
- Satirical framing device - the humor comes from his voice

## Structure

### Main Text
- **Serious, readable, informative**
- Explores the NTL point of divergence in detail
- Examines authorial assumptions
- Provides world-building context
- Historical analysis (legitimate)

### Forewords
- **Snarky, satirical, humorous**
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's voice
- Sets the tone
- Establishes the satirical framing

### Footnotes
- **Where most of the humor lives**
- Academic snark
- Genealogical jabs (especially at the Meades)
- Inside jokes
- Satirical commentary

### Example: The Famous Meade Footnote
> * One is continually struck, in the course of this research, by the curious contrast in the archival discipline exhibited by the two principal families under examination. The Fairfax-Lockwood line, descending as it does from the unimpeachable Northern Neck proprietary and subsequently reinforced by the Sequoyah cadastral records, presents a pedigree of almost monastic clarity: every birth, marriage, and land patent attested in triplicate, with marginalia in the hand of no fewer than three county clerks.  
> 
> The Meades of Philadelphia, by contrast, appear to have treated their family tree with the same cavalier disregard they once displayed for Confederate property rights. One encounters, with distressing frequency, individuals who are simultaneously recorded as deceased in 1849 and remarried in 1857, or listed as the son of two different fathers depending upon which branch of the clan one consults.  
> 
> It is perhaps unsurprising that a family so practiced in the art of creative reorganization should have produced the very men who, in the 1860s and 1870s, excelled at reorganizing other people's barns with kerosene.  
> 
> The present author, secure in the knowledge that his own descent may be traced without ambiguity from Lord Fairfax's land office to the present day (and, one might add, without the necessity of inventing any additional grandfathers), feels no compulsion to pursue the matter further.
> 
> M.J.F.L.

**This is the perfect example:** Serious academic tone, but the content is satirical and humorous.

## Tone & Style

### The Main Text
- Academic, serious, informative
- Legitimate historical analysis
- Readable and engaging
- Provides real value to readers

### The Framing (Forewords/Footnotes)
- **Rowan Atkinson-style humor:** Straight-faced, earnest delivery that becomes absurdist
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's voice - completely serious, never breaks character
- Academic pretension delivered with deadpan earnestness
- Genealogical obsessions treated with utmost seriousness
- Pointed jabs at other families (especially Meades) delivered with straight-faced academic rigor
- **The humor comes from the contrast:** Serious tone + absurd content = absurdist comedy

### The Balance
- **70% serious content, 30% snark (Rowan Atkinson-style)**
- The humor enhances rather than detracts
- **Humor style:** Straight-faced, earnest delivery that becomes absurdist through contrast
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood never breaks character - completely serious, which makes it funnier
- Readers can skip the snark if they want
- But the snark makes it more entertaining
- **Key:** The more serious and earnest he is about absurd topics, the funnier it becomes

---

## Examples of Snark

### In Forewords
- Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's obsession with genealogical purity (delivered with deadpan seriousness)
- His defensive stance about the Fairfax-Lockwood line (completely earnest, never breaks character)
- His dismissive attitude toward other families (straight-faced academic rigor)
- His academic pretensions (Rowan Atkinson-style: the more serious, the funnier)

### In Footnotes
- The Meade family genealogical jabs (delivered with straight-faced academic seriousness)
- The Jacobus incident reference (earnest defense that becomes absurd)
- Academic rivalries (treated with deadpan seriousness)
- Inside jokes (wrapped in earnest academic language)
- Satirical commentary on historical events (completely serious tone, absurd content)
- **Rowan Atkinson-style:** Never breaks character - the earnestness makes the absurdity funnier

### The Jacobus Incident (1986)
- The moment Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood's scholarly serenity is shattered
- A graduate student asks about the "Atrocious Lockwood Blunder"
- Lockwood chokes, sprays water, and dismisses it as a "distant branch"
- Perfect comedic moment

## Relationship to Main Series

### Standalone Product
- Can be read independently
- Provides context for the novels
- But not required reading

### Companion Piece
- Enhances the main series
- Provides "Behind the Scenes" content
- Explores assumptions and choices
- Adds depth to the world-building

### Separate Tone
- **Novels:** Serious alternate history (1863-1939 timeline)
- **Compendium:** Serious content with satirical framing (1985 "publication")
- The humor doesn't undermine the novels
- It adds a layer of entertainment

### Important Distinction
- **Dr. Gen. Fairfax-Lockwood does NOT appear in the novels**
- He exists only as the fictional "author" of the compendium
- The compendium is a meta-text - a book "written" by a fictional character about the fictional timeline
- Think of it like a "historical analysis" of the alternate history, written by a character from that alternate history

- **Satirical Framing:** Humor in forewords/footnotes, serious content in main text
