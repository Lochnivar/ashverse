# Lincoln's Fate: The 1864 Election and the Treaty

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Lincoln never has to sign the treaty.

He loses the election fair and square,  
serves out his term with dignity,  
and lets McClellan own the surrender.

That's the cleanest, most historically honest,  
and most emotionally devastating outcome possible.

No reluctant acceptance.  
No dramatic overruling.  
No lame-duck sabotage.

Just a defeated president  
who hands the pen to the man the voters chose  
and walks away.

## The Exact Sequence (March 1864 – March 1865)

| Date | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **November 1864** | Lincoln loses the election to McClellan on a straight "peace now" platform. |
| **4 March 1865** | McClellan is inaugurated. Lincoln becomes a lame-duck president for exactly 27 days. |
| **31 March 1865** | Treaty of Cincinnati signed. Lincoln is no longer in office. |

## Lincoln's Last Public Act (2 March 1865)

A short, bitter farewell address from the White House steps:

**"The people have chosen peace.  
I pray it is the peace that heals,  
and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning.  
God save these United States."**

He then boards the train to Springfield  
and never speaks publicly about the war again.

## The Result

Lincoln does not have to sign the treaty.

He loses the election fair and square,  
serves out his term with dignity,  
and lets McClellan own the surrender.

That's the cleanest, most historically honest,  
and most emotionally devastating outcome possible.
