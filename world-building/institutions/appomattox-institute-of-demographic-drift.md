# Institute of Demographic Drift — Appomattox College Annex

**Established:** 1934  
**Location:** Institute Hall, Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy  
**Status:** Neutral empirical observatory (no policy role)  
**Date Created:** December 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Optional depth document — tracks population movements and mixing across shard borders

## Core Concept

The Institute of Demographic Drift serves as a neutral tracker of continental population movements and mixing. Founded after observing the pattern of "Appomattox marriages" (inter-nation unions between alumni), it measures how economic opportunity and personal choice are reshaping demographics across shard boundaries.

## Founding and Mission

**Founding (1934):**  
Proposed by Appomattox alumni tracking their own marriages and career moves. Faculty realize that cross-border migration and intermarriage are creating demographic patterns that no one is systematically measuring. California funds as "demographic awareness tool."

**Charter Mission Statement:**  
> "The Institute of Demographic Drift exists to measure movement, not manage it. We track where people go and who they become; we do not direct migration or enforce borders. Our data reflects the reality that economics and opportunity reshape populations regardless of political boundaries."

## Structure

- **Faculty:** Rotating 50/50 USA/CSA split; California overseer enforces neutrality
- **Output:** Annual **Drift Report** — maps, tables, and charts of:
  - Cross-border migration flows (temporary and permanent)
  - Inter-nation marriage rates and trends
  - Mixed-heritage household distributions
  - Career cross-border moves (especially Appomattox alumni)
  - Projected demographic shifts over 10/20/30 year horizons
- **Distribution:** Mailed free to census bureaus, statistical offices, and alumni on January 1 each year

---

## Key Metrics

**The Drift Report tracks:**
- **Migration Flows:** Annual cross-border moves (temporary workers, permanent resettlement, refugees)
- **Marriage Patterns:** Inter-nation marriage rates, trends over time, geographic distribution
- **Mixed Households:** Households with members from multiple shards (parents, children, extended family)
- **Alumni Tracking:** Career moves of Appomattox graduates across borders
- **Demographic Projections:** 10/20/30 year forecasts based on current trends

**Example Finding (1936):**  
"Estimated cross-border population: ~2.1M (1.8% of total continental population). Inter-nation marriage rate: 4.2% of all marriages (up from 2.1% in 1910). Appomattox alumni: 23% live/work outside home shard by age 40."

## Disclaimers Against Misuse

**Disclaimer Example (1937):**  
> The Institute protests citation of Drift Report data by shard governments as justification for isolation policies or border restrictions. Our data measures demographic reality; it is not a prescription for population control. To use it as such undermines its neutrality and misrepresents our mission as observers, not directors.

---

## Significance and Ironies

- Illustrates economic pulls reshaping demographics — people move for opportunity, not ideology
- "Appomattox marriages" become measurable trend, proving that proximity breeds understanding
- No prescription for "correct" demographics — just measurement of what's happening
- Demonstrates that borders are political fictions that people navigate pragmatically

**Ashverse Fit:**  
Reinforces pragmatic theme — people vote with their feet, and economics drives mixing regardless of political rhetoric. The Drift Report proves that real reconciliation happens at the personal level, one marriage and one career move at a time.

---

**Plausibility:** 82–86% (1930s demographic tracking natural; pragmatic focus avoids moral prescription)
