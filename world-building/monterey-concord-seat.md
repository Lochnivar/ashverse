# Monterey: The Neutral Salon of the American Concord

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Monterey is the neutral salon, not the throne room.

It's the North-American equivalent of Geneva or The Hague.

## Why Monterey?

### The Official Line
(Printed in every Concord program:)

**"The City of Monterey, by its central location on the Pacific coast and its historic role as the cradle of Californian independence, is honored to serve as the permanent seat of the American Concord."**

### The Unofficial Line
(Whispered in the hotel bar by every aide who's been there before:)

**"They picked Monterey because California wanted it, and nobody else had the votes or the cash to argue."**

## The Perfect Neutral Ground

### Geographic Advantages
- **Gorgeous weather** - Perfect for summits year-round
- **Perfectly neutral historic ground** - First capital of California under Mexican rule, raised the Bear Flag in 1846
- **Hotels, ballrooms, and deep-water harbor** - All owned by Californians, naturally
- **Far enough from San Francisco** - Presidents feel like they're "away from politics"
- **Close enough to San Francisco** - California controls every road, rail line, and telegraph cable in or out

### California's Control
- Owns the building
- Owns the harbor
- Owns the wine
- Owns every journalist who writes the headlines
- Controls every road, rail line, and telegraph cable

But it's presented as **neutral historic ground**.

## The Reality

No one ever says California "leads" the Concord.

They don't have to.

They just own the building, the harbor, the wine, and every journalist who writes the headlines.

## The Vibe

Monterey is where:
- The temperature drops ten degrees the moment you step off the plane
- The wine is cold, the view is perfect
- Everyone suddenly remembers there is a **much bigger world** outside their 1861 grudge match
- California makes it **embarrassing** to act like children when the adults (Beijing, Tokyo, London, Berlin) are watching

It's not neutrality.

It's **enlightened self-interest with perfect weather**.
