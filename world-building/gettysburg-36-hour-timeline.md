# Gettysburg 36-Hour Timeline - Meade's Hesitation

**Date Created:** December 5, 2025  
**Book:** The Match (Book 1)  
**Status:** Reference Document  
**Key Point:** Meade freezes for 36 hours (until 18:00, July 3, 1863)

---

## RATIONALE FOR 36-HOUR DELAY

**Why 36 hours is believable:**
- Meade is exhausted
- Terrified of a Chancellorsville rerun
- Has no cavalry screen to the north
- Every report on July 2 says "the enemy is still in our front"
- Gives Meade plausible deniability: "I needed to wait for VI Corps and the trains"

**Why 36 hours works dramatically:**
- Long enough for Longstreet to do something truly dramatic
- Gives Longstreet a 65–70 mile head start
- Perfect balance of dramatic and defensible

## COMPLETE 36-HOUR TIMELINE

| Date / Time (1863) | Union Army of the Potomac | Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (Longstreet commanding) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2 July 04:00** | Meade asleep on Cemetery Hill after arriving at 03:00 | Longstreet's order issued; countermarch north begins |
| **2 July 12:00** | First Union scouts report "enemy appears to be gone" – Meade thinks it's a feint | Head of column (Rodes + artillery) 18 mi north of Gettysburg; tail (Heth) clearing Mummasburg |
| **2 July 18:00** | Meade holds council of war – "It must be a trap" – decides to wait until morning | Entire army north of Carlisle; Fitzhugh Lee rides into York unopposed |
| **3 July dawn** | Buford finally confirms the Mummasburg/Carlisle roads are packed with Confederate traffic – Meade still waits for VI Corps to close up | Lead elements (Early & Johnson) reach Susquehanna fords west of Harrisburg |
| **3 July 12:00** | Harrisburg mayor sends white-flag delegation – panic in Washington begins | Harrisburg formally summoned to surrender (terms generous) |
| **3 July 18:00** | **Meade finally issues march orders** – VI Corps to move at first light 4 July, rest of army to follow | Entire army across the Susquehanna except rearguard (Hampton) at Carlisle. Harrisburg occupied at 14:00. Capitol, arsenal, treasury, and all rail bridges now in Confederate hands. Longstreet's headquarters in the state capitol building. |
| **4 July dawn** | VI Corps steps off north on the Carlisle Pike – fastest possible vanguard | Longstreet already deciding which city to threaten next: Baltimore (70 mi), Lancaster/Philadelphia (60 mi), or simply fortify the west-bank heights and dare Meade to cross a 1,200-yard-wide river against 270 guns |

## WHAT LONGSTREET HAS ACHIEVED BY 18:00, JULY 3

At the exact moment Meade finally says "go," Longstreet has:

- **The Susquehanna at Meade's back instead of his own**
- **30,000 extra rifles** and millions in Pennsylvania state funds
- **A 65–70 mile head start**
- **Three separate rail lines** to live off
- **36 hours of operational freedom** already banked

**Result:** Meade's pursuit is now a strategic foot-race he cannot possibly win.

- **Harrisburg:** Falls at 14:00 on July 3, before Meade even moves
- **Longstreet's options:** Multiple strategic choices by July 4 dawn
