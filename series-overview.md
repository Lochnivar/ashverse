## Central Conflict
July 1, 1863, ~10:30 p.m., Gettysburg. Robert E. Lee collapses dead in his tent at the Widow Leister house. Longstreet spends the long night with Lee's corpse, assuming command he already knew was his. At 4:12 a.m. on July 2, he writes the order: "The army will withdraw northwest at first light. We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us."

The course of American history changes forever. The Confederacy survives as an independent nation, but at what cost? Through the eyes of two prominent families—Fairfax and Haskell—and those caught in the fire, the continent navigates decades of uneasy peace, economic warfare, Native American sovereignty, California's secession, and the slow, painful death of slavery. As Europe burns again in 1939, North America watches, knowing their own ashes still smolder.

## Series Arc Summary
**The Match (Novella, 1 Jul 1863 – 31 Mar 1865, 21 months, 180-220 pages)** - The single heartbeat that saves the Confederacy and dooms American unity. Lee's death at ~10:30 p.m. on July 1, 1863. Longstreet's long night of decision. At 4:12 a.m. on July 2, he writes: "We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us." The Confederacy wins independence by March 31, 1865, but American unity is forever lost.

**Book 1: The Fire (1 Apr 1865 – 31 Dec 1894, 29 years 9 months, 450-500 pages)** - Raids, boycott, and Toombs's suicidal arrogance kill slavery in practice. The independent Confederacy struggles to survive economically. Native super-states rise. Slavery continues in name but dies in practice through economic pressure and international boycotts.

**Book 2: The Embers (1 Jan 1895 – 31 Dec 1919, 25 years, 450-500 pages)** - The continent learns to make money together while still hating each other. Slavery is finally abolished in 1905, twenty years after it died in practice. Economic cooperation develops even as political divisions remain.

**Book 3: The Ashes (1 Jan 1920 – 30 Sep 1939, 19 years 9 months, 450-500 pages)** - The triad is forged in German stupidity, and Europe burns again. California has been independent since 1873—the Republic of California, fully sovereign and recognized for 47 years by 1920. European events force North American cooperation, creating the triad relationship. As Europe goes to war on September 30, 1939, the continent watches, knowing their own ashes still smolder.
