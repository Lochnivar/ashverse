# Treaty of Cincinnati: Comprehensive Analysis
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete legal, structural, and political analysis of the foundational treaty

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Treaty of Cincinnati (March 31, 1865)** is the legal foundation for the entire post-1865 North American political structure. It creates the three-nation system (USA, CSA, Native super-states), establishes Deseret as a sovereign theocracy, and sets the terms that govern continental relations for the next 76 years until the American Concord (1917-1925).

**Critical Finding:** The treaty is simultaneously **legally binding** and **structurally fragile**. It relies on mutual exhaustion rather than enforcement mechanisms, creating a system where violations (like the 300% punitive tariffs) are technically illegal but practically unenforceable.

## PART 1: EXACT BORDERS

### 1.1 Confederate States of America Borders

**Article 2 - Exact Text:**
> "CSA consists of: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas. Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line."

**Analysis:**
- **11 states total:** The 10 original seceded states plus Tennessee (which fell to Union control in 1862 but is restored to CSA in the treaty)
- **Western boundary:** 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line
  - This creates a hard western limit preventing CSA expansion into the Great Plains
  - The 100th meridian runs roughly through modern-day Oklahoma/Texas border
  - North of Indian Territory, the boundary follows the Indian Territory line (exact location needs clarification)

**Gap Identified:** The exact northern terminus of the 100th meridian boundary at the Indian Territory line is not precisely defined. This could create disputes later.

### 1.2 Border States Status

**Article 3 - Exact Text:**
> "Kentucky and Missouri remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River. Maryland remains U.S. **West Virginia stays a U.S. state** – 'The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States.'"

**Kentucky:**
- **Status:** U.S. state (not CSA)
- **Neutrality provision:** No permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River
- **Enforcement:** Unclear - who monitors this? No enforcement mechanism specified
- **Implication:** Kentucky becomes a de-militarized buffer zone, but remains legally part of the USA

**Missouri:**
- **Status:** U.S. state (not CSA) - same as Kentucky
- **Neutrality provision:** Same 50-mile Ohio River buffer zone
- **Note:** Missouri's border with CSA (Arkansas) is NOT covered by the 50-mile rule - only the Ohio River border
- **Gap:** What about the Mississippi River border? No specific provision

**Maryland:**
- **Status:** U.S. state (no special provisions)
- **No neutrality clause** - remains fully under U.S. control

**West Virginia:**
- **Status:** U.S. state - **LOCKED IN**
- **Exact language:** "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States."
- **Why it works:** 
  - West Virginia sent 32,000 men to Union army
  - CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right
  - Political suicide for McClellan to hand it back
  - Virginia grumbles but has no leverage

### 1.3 Indian Territory Boundaries

**Article 4 - Exact Text:**
> "All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognised as sovereign republics under joint U.S.–CSA protection."

**What This Creates:**
- **Sequoyah (Five Civilized Tribes):** Article 4 explicitly recognizes united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored
  - Territory: All of modern Oklahoma + chunks of north Texas & SE Kansas
  - Instant sovereignty (1865)
  
- **Dakota (Lakota Confederacy):** U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory
  - Territory: Most of modern North & South Dakota + eastern Montana
  - Instant sovereignty (1865)

- **Comanchería:** Treaty Article 5 – "the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognized as single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders
  - Territory: Texas Panhandle + western Oklahoma + eastern New Mexico
  - Instant sovereignty (1865)

- **Navajo (Diné):** Treaty Article 6 – 1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range
  - Territory: Four Corners region (larger than OTL)
  - Instant sovereignty (1865)

**Critical Gap:** The treaty document shows Article 4 as general "Indian Territory" but other sources indicate Articles 4, 5, and 6 specify individual nations. This numbering discrepancy needs resolution.

### 1.4 Deseret Boundaries

**Article 7 - Exact Text (from mormon-deseret.md):**
> "The State of Deseret, comprising the Great Basin territory settled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is recognised as a sovereign entity under joint U.S.–Confederate protection."

**Boundaries:**
- Roughly modern Utah + southern Nevada + small slices of Arizona/Colorado/Idaho
- Based on 1850s State of Deseret proposal, minus California's claims
- **Realism check:** 9/10

**Critical Discrepancy:** The treaty-of-cincinnati.md document shows Article 7 as "Reparations" not "Deseret." Multiple sources confirm Deseret is Article 7. This suggests either:
1. The treaty document is missing an article, OR
2. The numbering is different than shown, OR
3. Deseret is in a separate article not listed in the main document

**Recommendation:** This needs clarification. The treaty document should be updated to show Deseret as Article 7, or the numbering should be corrected.

## PART 2: KEY ARTICLES AND PROVISIONS

### 2.1 Article 1: Recognition

**Exact Text:**
> "The United States recognises the Confederate States of America as a sovereign and independent nation."

**Legal Significance:**
- This is **irreversible** under international law
- Once recognition is granted, it cannot be withdrawn without war
- Creates the legal foundation for all subsequent relations

**Political Context:**
- McClellan's campaign promise – no choice after 1864 election
- Lincoln never signs it (he loses the election, McClellan is inaugurated March 4, 1865)

### 2.2 Article 4: Native Super-States

**Exact Text:**
> "All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognised as sovereign republics under joint U.S.–CSA protection."

**What "Sovereign Republics" Means:**
- Full sovereignty (not reservations, not protectorates)
- Joint protection = neither USA nor CSA can unilaterally violate their borders
- Creates the "third pole" of North American politics

**Legal Precedent:**
- Similar to OTL recognition of Native nations as sovereign (e.g., Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 1831)
- But goes further - these are not "domestic dependent nations" but fully sovereign

**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Joint protection means both USA and CSA must agree to any action
- In practice, this creates a veto system - neither can act alone
- This is the enforcement mechanism (mutual veto)

### 2.3 Article 7: Mormon Deseret (Sovereign Theocracy)

**Exact Text:**
> "The State of Deseret, comprising the Great Basin territory settled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is recognised as a sovereign entity under joint U.S.–Confederate protection."

**What "Sovereign Theocracy" Means Legally:**
- **Sovereignty:** Full independence, not a U.S. or CSA territory
- **Theocracy:** Church leadership (Brigham Young) is the de facto government
- **Joint protection:** Same veto system as Native super-states

**Why It Works:**
- Both U.S. and CSA are terrified of another Utah War
- Brigham Young still commands 15,000 armed men in 1865
- Neither side has troops or will to fight Salt Lake after four years of bleeding

**Legal Status:**
- Not a "state" in either USA or CSA
- Not a "territory" 
- Fully sovereign entity (like a micro-nation)
- Similar to Vatican City in OTL (sovereign theocracy)

### 2.4 Article 8: Trade Provisions

**Exact Text:**
> "Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years. No discriminatory tariffs."

**What This Means:**
- **Most-favored-nation (MFN):** Each side must give the other the same trade terms as their best trading partner
- **20-year duration:** Expires in 1885 (unless renewed)
- **No discriminatory tariffs:** Cannot impose higher tariffs on CSA goods than on other nations

**The Violation (1868-1905):**
- USA imposes 300% punitive tariffs after Toombs Act re-opens African slave trade
- USA's legal argument: "Article 8 assumes both parties are civilised nations. A state that re-opens the African trade has forfeited that status."
- **Result:** 
  - Universally condemned as illegal in CSA rhetoric
  - Universally accepted as necessary by every other country
  - CSA is powerless to stop it

**Enforcement Gap:**
- No enforcement mechanism specified
- No arbitration clause
- No penalty for violation
- In practice, might makes right

### 2.5 Article 9: Military Drawdown

**Exact Text:**
> "Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months. No fortifications within 20 miles of the border."

**Timeline:**
- Signed: March 31, 1865
- Deadline: September 30, 1866 (18 months later)
- Target: 25,000 men each (down from ~1 million+ during war)

**Enforcement:**
- No verification mechanism specified
- No penalty for non-compliance
- Relies on mutual exhaustion and economic necessity

**Border Fortifications:**
- 20-mile demilitarized zone on both sides
- Creates a 40-mile total buffer zone
- Prevents immediate rematch

---

## PART 3: LEGAL MECHANISMS

### 3.1 How It Differs from OTL Treaties

**Comparison to Treaty of Paris (1783):**
- **Similarity:** Both end major wars, recognize independence
- **Difference:** Treaty of Paris had clear enforcement (British withdrawal, U.S. payment of debts)
- **Difference:** Treaty of Cincinnati has NO enforcement mechanism - relies on mutual exhaustion

**Comparison to Treaty of Ghent (1814):**
- **Similarity:** Both are "status quo ante bellum" peace treaties
- **Difference:** Ghent restored pre-war borders; Cincinnati creates NEW borders
- **Difference:** Ghent had arbitration mechanisms; Cincinnati has none

**Comparison to Treaty of Versailles (1919):**
- **Similarity:** Both create new political structures
- **Difference:** Versailles had League of Nations enforcement; Cincinnati has nothing
- **Difference:** Versailles imposed reparations; Cincinnati has none (both sides bankrupt)

### 3.2 What Makes It Binding

**Legal Binding Mechanisms:**
1. **Recognition (Article 1):** Once granted, cannot be withdrawn without war
2. **Ratification (Article 10):** "Effective immediately upon signature" - no Senate ratification needed (McClellan has full authority)
3. **No amendments clause:** "No amendments without mutual consent" - creates permanence

**Practical Binding Mechanisms:**
1. **Mutual exhaustion:** Neither side can restart the war
2. **Economic necessity:** Both need trade (even if violated later)
3. **Geographic reality:** Borders are where armies stopped
4. **Political will:** McClellan was elected on peace platform

**What Makes It Fragile:**
1. **No enforcement mechanism:** Violations (like tariffs) go unpunished
2. **No arbitration:** Disputes have no resolution mechanism
3. **No verification:** Military drawdown not monitored
4. **Unilateral violation possible:** USA proves this with tariffs

### 3.3 What Happens If Violated

**The Tariff Violation (1868):**
- **Violation:** USA imposes 300% tariffs (violates Article 8)
- **CSA Response:** Protests, condemns as illegal
- **International Response:** Accepts USA's "civilized nations" argument
- **Result:** Violation stands, treaty is effectively partially voided
- **Enforcement:** None - CSA has no power to enforce

**Legal Precedent Created:**
- Treaties can be violated if one side claims the other has "forfeited" status
- "Civilized nations" clause becomes de facto escape hatch
- Might makes right in practice

**Other Potential Violations:**
- Military size limits (Article 9): No verification, easy to violate
- Border fortifications (Article 9): Hard to monitor, easy to violate
- Border state neutrality (Article 3): Who enforces the 50-mile rule?

### 3.4 How It Creates the Three-Nation System

**The Three Nations:**
1. **United States of America** (East Coast + Midwest)
2. **Confederate States of America** (11 states)
3. **Native Super-States** (Sequoyah, Dakota, Comanchería, Navajo, plus Deseret)

**Mechanism:**
- **Article 1:** Creates USA and CSA as separate nations
- **Article 4 (and 5, 6):** Creates Native super-states as sovereign entities
- **Article 7:** Creates Deseret as sovereign theocracy
- **Joint protection clauses:** Prevents either USA or CSA from absorbing Native territories

**Result:**
- Five (or six) sovereign entities on the continent
- None can dominate the others
- Creates permanent balance of power
- Native nations become the "third pole" - neither North nor South

---

## PART 4: POLITICAL CONTEXT

### 4.1 Who Signs for Each Side

**United States:**
- **Signatory:** President George B. McClellan
- **Date:** March 31, 1865
- **Authority:** Full presidential authority (no Senate ratification needed per Article 10)
- **Context:** Inaugurated March 4, 1865 (27 days earlier)

**Confederate States:**
- **Signatory:** NOT SPECIFIED in documents
- **Likely candidates:**
  - Jefferson Davis (CSA President) - most likely
  - Alexander H. Stephens (CSA VP, moderate) - possible
  - Other negotiator - possible
- **Gap:** This needs clarification

**Note:** Lincoln never signs it - he loses the 1864 election, serves out his term, and McClellan signs it 27 days after inauguration.

### 4.2 Where It Is Signed

**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio

**Why Cincinnati:**
- **Neutral ground:** Border city, not clearly "Northern" or "Southern" in 1865
- **Accessibility:** Major river port, railroad hub
- **Symbolism:** Ohio River is the border - signing on the border is symbolic
- **Practical:** Both sides can reach it easily

**Ceremony:**
- **NOT SPECIFIED** in documents
- **Likely:** Somber, no victory parades
- **Tone:** "The ugliest possible peace" - exhausted, bitter, necessary

**Gap:** Details of the signing ceremony are not documented. This could be developed.

### 4.3 Public Reaction

**Northern Reaction:**
- **NOT SPECIFIED** in documents
- **Likely:** Mixed - peace supporters relieved, war supporters bitter
- **McClellan's base:** Satisfied (he was elected on peace platform)
- **Radical Republicans:** Furious (slavery preserved, CSA recognized)

**Southern Reaction:**
- **NOT SPECIFIED** in documents
- **Likely:** Cautious celebration - independence won, but at what cost?
- **Planters:** Satisfied (slavery preserved)
- **Common people:** Exhausted, relieved war is over

**Gap:** Detailed public reaction is not documented. This could be developed.

## PART 5: RELATIONSHIP TO LATER EVENTS

### 5.1 California Independence (1873)

**How Treaty of Cincinnati Enables California Independence:**

1. **Geographic Isolation:**
   - Treaty creates Native super-states that block land routes
   - California becomes de facto exclave (connected only by sea)
   - No land bridge = no way to enforce Union control

2. **Precedent:**
   - Treaty proves secession is legal if you win
   - California does it "cleaner" (peaceful referendum vs. war)

3. **No Enforcement Mechanism:**
   - USA has no army within 1,500 miles
   - No political will for another civil war
   - Needs California's ports for trade

**Treaty Interaction:**
- California is a U.S. state in 1865 (not mentioned in treaty)
- Treaty doesn't prevent state secession (only deals with CSA recognition)
- California's 1873 independence is separate from Treaty of Cincinnati
- But treaty's precedent (sovereignty through victory) enables it

### 5.2 Native Super-States Rights

**What Rights They Actually Have:**

1. **Sovereignty:**
   - Full independence (not reservations)
   - Can make their own laws
   - Can conduct foreign relations
   - Can control borders

2. **Joint Protection:**
   - Neither USA nor CSA can unilaterally violate borders
   - Creates mutual veto system
   - But no enforcement if both agree to violate (unlikely but possible)

3. **Trade Rights:**
   - Can trade with both USA and CSA
   - Can set their own tariffs
   - Can control transit (creates "toll war" scenario in 1872)

4. **Citizenship:**
   - Can grant citizenship (Sequoyah does this for escaped slaves)
   - Can refuse extradition
   - Can control immigration

**Limitations:**
- No military alliance (joint protection is defensive only)
- No guarantee of support if attacked by outside power
- Economic dependence on both USA and CSA

### 5.3 Deseret Sovereignty in Practice

**What It Means:**

1. **Political:**
   - Brigham Young rules as de facto prophet-king (1865-1877)
   - No U.S. governor, no federal troops
   - Church leadership = government

2. **Legal:**
   - Deseret law applies (not U.S. or CSA law)
   - Can control borders
   - Can conduct foreign relations

3. **Economic:**
   - Controls its own economy
   - Can trade with both USA and CSA
   - Becomes "Mormon Venice" - neutral broker

4. **Military:**
   - Maintains its own militia (15,000+ men in 1865)
   - No foreign garrisons
   - Can defend itself

**Limitations:**
- Joint protection means can't expand
- Economic dependence on trade
- International recognition limited (only USA and CSA recognize it)

### 5.4 USA-CSA Trade Disputes

**What They Can Legally Do:**

1. **Under Article 8:**
   - Must give MFN status
   - Cannot impose discriminatory tariffs
   - But USA violates this in 1868

2. **After Violation:**
   - CSA can protest (does)
   - CSA can impose retaliatory tariffs (likely does)
   - But no arbitration mechanism
   - No enforcement

3. **Legal Options:**
   - **Diplomatic:** Protests, negotiations (limited effectiveness)
   - **Retaliation:** Counter-tariffs (trade war)
   - **War:** Technically possible but neither side wants it
   - **International:** Appeal to other nations (limited recognition)

**Result:**
- Trade disputes become permanent feature
- No resolution mechanism
- Economic warfare becomes norm
- Both sides suffer but continue

### 5.5 Border State Neutrality Enforcement

**How It's Enforced:**

1. **Article 3 Provision:**
   - No permanent garrisons within 50 miles of Ohio River
   - Applies to both USA and CSA

2. **Enforcement Mechanism:**
   - **NOT SPECIFIED** in treaty
   - Likely: Mutual monitoring (each side watches the other)
   - Likely: Complaints through diplomatic channels
   - No verification mechanism
   - No penalty for violation

3. **In Practice:**
   - Relies on mutual interest (neither wants border war)
   - Relies on exhaustion (neither can afford it)
   - Easy to violate if one side wants to

**Gap:** No clear enforcement mechanism. This is a structural weakness.

---

## PART 6: LEGAL PLAUSIBILITY ASSESSMENT

### 6.1 Do These Provisions Make Sense?

**✅ Plausible Provisions:**
- Recognition (Article 1): Standard international law
- Borders (Article 2): Based on military reality
- Border states neutrality (Article 3): Prevents immediate war
- Native sovereignty (Article 4): Unprecedented but plausible given exhaustion
- Military drawdown (Article 9): Standard peace treaty provision

**⚠️ Questionable Provisions:**
- Trade MFN (Article 8): Standard but no enforcement
- Deseret sovereignty (Article 7): Unprecedented but plausible
- No reparations (Article 7 in treaty doc): Unusual but both sides bankrupt

**❌ Problematic Provisions:**
- No enforcement mechanisms: Major weakness
- No arbitration: Disputes have no resolution
- No verification: Easy to violate
- Unilateral violation precedent: USA tariffs show this

### 6.2 Enforcement Mechanism Analysis

**What Exists:**
- Mutual exhaustion (practical, not legal)
- Joint protection veto (for Native states)
- Economic necessity (practical, not legal)
- Political will (temporary, not permanent)

**What's Missing:**
- International guarantor (no third party)
- Arbitration mechanism (no dispute resolution)
- Verification system (no monitoring)
- Penalty clauses (no consequences for violation)
- Enforcement body (no one to enforce)

**Verdict:** The treaty is **legally binding** but **practically unenforceable**. It works because both sides are too exhausted to violate it, not because of legal mechanisms.

### 6.3 Internal Consistency Check

**Contradictions Found:**

1. **Article Numbering:**
   - Treaty doc shows Article 7 as "Reparations"
   - Multiple sources show Article 7 as "Deseret"
   - **Resolution needed:** Update treaty document or clarify numbering

2. **Native States:**
   - Article 4 says "Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations"
   - But Articles 4, 5, 6 specify individual nations
   - **Resolution needed:** Clarify if Article 4 is general or specific

3. **Border State Neutrality:**
   - Article 3 covers Ohio River (Kentucky/Missouri)
   - But Missouri also borders CSA on Mississippi River
   - **Gap:** No provision for Mississippi River border

**No Major Contradictions:** The treaty is internally consistent except for numbering discrepancies.

### 6.4 Historical Precedent Analysis

**OTL Parallels:**

1. **Treaty of Paris (1783):** Recognition of independence ✅
2. **Treaty of Ghent (1814):** Status quo ante bellum peace ✅
3. **Native sovereignty:** Cherokee Nation cases (1830s) - partial precedent ✅
4. **Theocracy:** Vatican City (1929) - later precedent for sovereign theocracy ✅
5. **Unenforceable treaties:** Many historical examples ✅

**Unique Aspects:**
- Joint protection of third parties (Native states)
- Sovereign theocracy recognition
- No enforcement mechanisms (unusual but not unprecedented)

**Verdict:** The treaty has historical precedents for most provisions. The combination is unique but plausible.

### 6.5 Gaps That Would Cause Problems Later

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

1. **No Enforcement Mechanism:**
   - Violations go unpunished (tariffs prove this)
   - Creates precedent for unilateral action
   - **Impact:** Trade disputes become permanent

2. **No Arbitration:**
   - Disputes have no resolution
   - Leads to permanent tensions
   - **Impact:** No way to resolve conflicts peacefully

3. **No Verification:**
   - Military limits not monitored
   - Border fortifications not verified
   - **Impact:** Easy to violate, hard to prove

4. **Border State Neutrality:**
   - No enforcement mechanism
   - No verification
   - **Impact:** Easy to violate if one side wants to

5. **Native State Protection:**
   - Joint protection only works if both sides agree
   - No protection if both sides agree to violate (unlikely but possible)
   - **Impact:** Native states vulnerable to collusion

6. **Deseret Boundaries:**
   - Not precisely defined
   - "Great Basin territory" is vague
   - **Impact:** Potential border disputes

7. **Indian Territory Boundaries:**
   - "Pre-war treaties" referenced but not specified
   - Exact borders not mapped
   - **Impact:** Potential disputes over boundaries

**Recommendation:** These gaps are **features, not bugs**. They create the structural weaknesses that drive later conflicts and make the world-building more interesting. But they should be acknowledged and understood.

## PART 7: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 7.1 Summary of Findings

**The Treaty of Cincinnati is:**

1. **Legally Binding:** Recognition is irreversible, ratification is immediate
2. **Structurally Fragile:** No enforcement mechanisms, easy to violate
3. **Politically Necessary:** Both sides too exhausted to continue war
4. **Geographically Realistic:** Borders reflect military reality
5. **Historically Plausible:** Has precedents for most provisions
6. **Internally Consistent:** No major contradictions (except numbering)

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Article Numbering Discrepancy:** Article 7 is listed as "Reparations" in treaty doc but "Deseret" in multiple sources
2. **Missing Enforcement:** No mechanisms to prevent or punish violations
3. **Vague Boundaries:** Some borders not precisely defined
4. **Missing Details:** Signatories, ceremony, public reaction not fully documented

### 7.2 Recommendations

**Immediate Actions Needed:**

1. **Resolve Article Numbering:**
   - Update treaty-of-cincinnati.md to show Deseret as Article 7
   - OR clarify if there are more than 10 articles
   - OR renumber articles consistently

2. **Clarify Signatories:**
   - Document who signs for CSA
   - Document ceremony details (if desired)
   - Document public reaction (if desired)

3. **Define Boundaries Precisely:**
   - Map exact Indian Territory borders
   - Define Deseret boundaries precisely
   - Clarify 100th meridian terminus

4. **Acknowledge Gaps:**
   - Document that enforcement gaps are intentional
   - Explain how violations are handled in practice
   - Show how disputes are resolved (or not)

**Long-Term Considerations:**

1. **Treaty Evolution:**
   - How does treaty change over time?
   - Are there amendments or side agreements?
   - How does American Concord (1917-1925) interact with it?

2. **Violation Precedents:**
   - Document all violations (tariffs, military limits, etc.)
   - Show how each violation is handled
   - Create consistent pattern for future violations

3. **Dispute Resolution:**
   - How are disputes handled in practice?
   - Are there informal mechanisms?
   - Does California become arbiter later?

### 7.3 Final Assessment

**The Treaty of Cincinnati is SOLID as a foundation document:**

✅ **Legal plausibility:** High (has precedents)  
✅ **Internal consistency:** High (minor numbering issues only)  
✅ **Historical precedent:** High (most provisions have parallels)  
✅ **Structural soundness:** Medium (intentionally fragile, creates conflict)  
✅ **Enforcement mechanism:** Low (intentionally weak, creates tension)  

**The gaps are features, not bugs.** They create the structural weaknesses that:
- Enable later conflicts (tariff wars, border disputes)
- Create narrative tension (violations, disputes)
- Make the world more interesting (no easy solutions)

**The treaty does its job:** It ends the war, creates the three-nation system, and sets up 76 years of resentment that culminate in the American Concord.
