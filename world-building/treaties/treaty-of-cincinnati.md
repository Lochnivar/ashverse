# Treaty of Cincinnati

## **PERMANENT LOCK - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

**Signed:** 31 March 1865  
**Status:** The ugliest possible peace

No victory parades.  
No moral triumph.  
Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt  
and agreeing to pretend the other one exists  
while the continent quietly bleeds out.

That's the treaty that ends the war  
and starts the next seventy-six years of resentment.

## The Articles

| Article | Exact Term (Verbatim Where Possible) | Real-World Justification |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **1. Recognition** | The United States recognises the Confederate States of America as a sovereign and independent nation. | McClellan's campaign promise – no choice after 1864 election |
| **2. Borders** | CSA consists of: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas. Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line. | Locks in 11 seceded states + Tennessee (fell 1862). No further expansion |
| **3. Border States** | Kentucky and Missouri remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River. Maryland remains U.S. **West Virginia stays a U.S. state** – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States." | Prevents immediate second war; Kentucky/Missouri too divided to force. West Virginia sent 32,000 men to Union army; forcing reunion is political suicide. CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right they claimed. |
| **4. Indian Territory** | All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognised as sovereign republics under joint U.S.–CSA protection. | Turns Native nations into buffer states – neither side can afford to restart removal |
| **5. Washington D.C.** | Remains U.S. capital but demilitarised except for ceremonial guard. CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy. | Prevents CSA from claiming the old capital; keeps symbolic continuity |
| **6. Slavery** | Status quo ante bellum – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S. No extradition of fugitive slaves across the new border. | McClellan's "peace without emancipation" platform |
| **7. Reparations** | None. Mutual release of all claims and debts. | Both treasuries are bankrupt |
| **8. Trade** | Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years. No discriminatory tariffs. **NOTE:** North violates this with punitive tariffs (300%) after Toombs Act re-opens African trade. See `world-building/punitive-tariffs-1868-1905.md` | Keeps the continent economically linked (in theory). In practice, North suspends Article 8 unilaterally while African trade exists. |
| **9. Military** | Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months. No fortifications within 20 miles of the border. | Prevents immediate rematch |
| **10. Ratification** | Effective immediately upon signature. No amendments without mutual consent. | McClellan needs peace now |

## Key Provisions Summary

### Recognition
- United States formally recognizes Confederate States of America as sovereign and independent
- No choice after McClellan's 1864 election on peace platform

### Borders
- **CSA consists of:** Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas
- **Western boundary:** 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line
- Locks in the 11 seceded states plus Tennessee (which fell in 1862)

### Border States
- **Kentucky and Missouri:** Remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River
- **Maryland:** Remains U.S.
- **West Virginia:** Stays a U.S. state – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States"
- Prevents immediate second war; Kentucky/Missouri too divided to force a decision
- **Why West Virginia stays U.S.:** West Virginia sent 32,000 men to the Union army. Handing them back to the CSA is political suicide in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the entire North. The CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right they claimed for themselves. Virginia grumbles, but the CSA has bigger problems and no leverage to demand it back.

### Indian Territory
- All pre-war treaties reaffirmed
- Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognized as sovereign republics under joint U.S.–CSA protection
- Turns Native nations into buffer states – neither side can afford to restart removal

### Washington D.C.
- Remains U.S. capital but demilitarized except for ceremonial guard
- CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy
- Prevents CSA from claiming the old capital; keeps symbolic continuity

### Slavery
- **Status quo ante bellum** – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S.
- No extradition of fugitive slaves across the new border
- McClellan's "peace without emancipation" platform

### Reparations
- None
- Mutual release of all claims and debts
- Both treasuries are bankrupt

### Trade
- Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years
- No discriminatory tariffs
- Keeps the continent economically linked (in theory)
- **In practice:** North violates Article 8 with punitive tariffs (300%) after Toombs Act re-opens African trade. North's argument: "Article 8 assumes both parties are civilised nations. A state that re-opens the African trade has forfeited that status." The violation is universally condemned as illegal in CSA rhetoric but universally accepted as necessary by every other country. The CSA is powerless to stop it. See `world-building/punitive-tariffs-1868-1905.md`

### Military
- Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months
- No fortifications within 20 miles of the border
- Prevents immediate rematch

### Ratification
- Effective immediately upon signature
- No amendments without mutual consent
- McClellan needs peace now

## The Result

The Treaty of Cincinnati is the ugliest possible peace:

- No victory parades
- No moral triumph
- Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt
- Agreeing to pretend the other one exists
- While the continent quietly bleeds out

That's the treaty that ends the war  
and starts the next seventy-six years of resentment.
