## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Brigade-level detail is accurate - **Justification:** Based on historical research
- Tactical realism is maintained - **Justification:** Aligns with OTL patterns
- Discrepancies resolved correctly - **Justification:** Established canon takes precedence

**Limitations:**
- Some details might need minor adjustments
- Timeline requires careful coordination
- Brigade movements need verification

**Edge Cases:**
- What if some brigade movements differ? → **Handled:** Timeline allows for variation
- What if timeline needs adjustment? → **Handled:** Can be updated if needed
