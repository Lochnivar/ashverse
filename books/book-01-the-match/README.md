## Book Blurb
July 1, 1863, ~10:30 p.m., Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In his headquarters tent at the Widow Leister house, General Robert E. Lee collapses mid-sentence while dictating orders, still furious that Ewell failed to take Cemetery Hill. He dies within minutes, surrounded by staff officers.

Longstreet is summoned at 10:47 p.m. He spends the entire night alone with Lee's corpse, President Davis's sealed contingency envelope, and the knowledge that the Union holds the high ground, Lee's last verbal order was "attack at dawn," but his own instinct is to withdraw while the army is still intact.

At 4:12 a.m. on July 2, Longstreet opens Davis's envelope, reads the succession clause, and quietly writes the order that ends the battle that never was: "The army will withdraw northwest at first light. We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us."

The match has been struck.

Through the eyes of the Fairfax and Meade families, and those who find themselves standing closest to the fire, we witness the birth of a new North America. The Confederacy struggles to survive as a nation. Native American tribes, seeing opportunity in the continent's division, begin to consolidate into sovereign super-states. And in the West, California watches and waits, quietly planning its own path.

This is not a story about who was right. This is a story about what happens when everyone is wrong, and the continent must learn to live with the consequences.

## Core Plot
The novella opens with the exact moment of divergence: Lee's death in his tent at ~10:30 p.m. on July 1, 1863. The narrative follows Longstreet's long night of decision—alone with Lee's body, Davis's sealed envelope, and the weight of command. At 4:12 a.m. on July 2, he makes the fateful choice to withdraw, writing the order that changes everything: "We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us."

The war continues but takes a different trajectory. Longstreet's withdrawal preserves the Army of Northern Virginia, and the war continues in a different form, eventually ending with a negotiated peace on March 31, 1865 that preserves Confederate independence. The narrative follows multiple perspectives: members of the Fairfax and Meade families, Longstreet and other military leaders, politicians, and ordinary people caught in the changing tides.

This is the single heartbeat—Lee's death—that saves the Confederacy (they win independence) but dooms American unity (the continent is permanently divided). The match has been struck. The fire will follow.
