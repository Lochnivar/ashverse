# Fairfax & Haskell Family Cast List (1863–1939)

## **PREFERRED STRUCTURE - FLEXIBILITY ALLOWED**

Fairfax & Haskell family cast list for the published canon (1863–1939).

**Note:** These are preferred POV characters, not locked requirements. Other characters will be created and used as needed, but these two families are the rock that shows the effects of the PoD shift. Flexibility is allowed if narrative demands it.

## The Cast

| Book / Era | Fairfax Family Member(s) | Role / POV Status | Haskell Family Member(s) | Role / POV Status |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **The Match (1863–65)** | John Walter Fairfax (b. 1841) | Primary POV (CSA officer, likely Longstreet aide or staff) | Frank A. Haskell (b. 1828) | Primary POV (Union officer, aide to General Gibbon at Gettysburg) |
| | Samantha Louise Meade (b. 1845) | Secondary POV (Union home front, Richmond, then Sequoyah) - **marries Thomas Reginald Fairfax in 1866, becomes Fairfax by marriage** | | |
| **The Fire (1865–94)** | Thomas Reginald Fairfax (b. 1841) | Primary POV (switches from John Walter) | Frank A. Haskell (survives or his legacy continues) | Secondary POV |
| | Thomas & Samantha Meade Fairfax (now married, main couple) | Primary POVs | | |
| | Beau Fairfax (Thomas's uncle, b. 1830) | Major supporting | [Haskell family member TBD] | Supporting |
| **The Embers (1895–1919)** | John Fairfax (Thomas & Samantha's eldest son, b. 1868) | Primary POV (Richmond lawyer, triad staffer) | [Haskell family member - Frank's descendant, b. ~1875] | Primary POV (Cincinnati society, Washington aide) |
| | Rose Fairfax (daughter, b. 1872) | Secondary POV (marries into Sequoyah citizenship) | [Haskell family member, b. ~1870] | Secondary (U.S. Navy officer) |
| **The Ashes (1920–39)** | Thomas Fairfax III ("Trip", b. 1898) | Primary POV (California oil heir, triad diplomat) | [Haskell family member, b. ~1902] | Primary POV (U.S. State Department, later California wife) |
| | Lydia Fairfax (Rose's daughter, b. 1905) | Secondary POV (Sequoyah council delegate) | [Haskell family member, b. ~1895] | Secondary (U.S. Navy, Pearl Harbor analogue) |

## Preferred Rules for Any Future Members

1. **At least one Fairfax and one Haskell alive and within smelling distance of every major event.** (This is the core rule - they are the rock that shows the effects of the PoD shift.)
2. **No member ever narrates every chapter** — they are touchstones, not omnipresent.
3. **By 1939 the family trees are dozens of cousins; only the above are preferred POVs.**
4. **Other characters will be created and used as needed** — the families are the foundation, but not the only characters.

## Important Note on Samantha Meade and the Meade Family

**Samantha Meade is NOT a Haskell.** She is a Meade who marries Thomas Fairfax in 1866. She becomes a witness through marriage into the Fairfax family, not through being part of the Haskell family. The Haskell family is the separate Northern witness family, with Frank A. Haskell as Gen 0.

**Note on the Meade Family:** The Meade family (possibly connected to General George Meade) can still exist and be used as minor/supporting characters in the story. They are NOT the major witness family - that role belongs to the Haskell family. Samantha Meade is part of this Meade family and marries Thomas Fairfax, becoming a witness through marriage.

## Other Characters

Others TBD. They are the only "permanent" characters, but there are other, more disposable, characters to be used as needed for the narrative.
