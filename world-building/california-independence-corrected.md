# California Independence: Corrected Timeline

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

California is independent by mid-1873.

Everything that previously said "1920s–1930s" or "1931 Treaty of San Francisco" is old draft residue and is hereby over-written.

California spends the entire 20th century as the rich, smug, Pacific-facing older sibling who has been its own country for 150 years by the time WW1 starts.

No later secession.

No 1930s date.

1872–1873 is locked canon.

## The Correct Timeline

| Event | Exact Date | Details |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Trigger – Great Native Toll War** | Jan–May 1872 | Native super-states triple railroad tolls → California trade strangled |
| **California Independence Referendum** | 5 Nov 1872 | 69% vote YES |
| **Treaty of San Francisco signed** | 14 Feb 1873 | Peaceful secession formalised |
| **Republic of California fully sovereign** | 4 July 1873 | Independence Day chosen deliberately |

## The Sequence

### January–May 1872: Great Native Toll War
Native super-states triple railroad tolls → California trade strangled.

### 5 November 1872: California Independence Referendum
69% vote YES.

### 14 February 1873: Treaty of Sacramento Signed
Peaceful secession formalised.

### 4 July 1873: Republic of California Fully Sovereign
Independence Day chosen deliberately.

## The Result

California is independent by mid-1873.

Everything that previously said "1920s–1930s" or "1931 Treaty of San Francisco" is old draft residue and is hereby over-written.

California spends the entire 20th century as the rich, smug, Pacific-facing older sibling who has been its own country for 150 years by the time WW1 starts.

No later secession.

No 1930s date.

1872–1873 is locked canon.
