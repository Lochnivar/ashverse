# Slavery's Death: Economic Impact Refinement Implementation

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - REFINED NUMBERS LOCKED  
**Purpose:** Document all updates to reflect refined economic impact numbers for Northern raids

---

## FINAL LOCKED CANON

**SLAVERY'S DEATH – ECONOMIC IMPACT REFINEMENTS (1865–1894)**

**Overall Plausibility: 93% – LOCKED**

**Total Raid Impact (1865–1894): $1.6 billion (1865 dollars)**  
**Annual average: $55 million/year ≈ 4.6% of CSA GDP**

## REVISED ECONOMIC IMPACT BREAKDOWN

| Component | Original Estimate | Revised Estimate | Change |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Direct crop destruction** | $16M | $16M | 0% |
| **Infrastructure damage** | $8.1M | $8.1M | 0% |
| **Security costs** | $1.45B | $348M | -76% |
| **Insurance costs** | $580M | $174M | -70% |
| **Labor loss (runaways)** | $40M | $40M | 0% |
| **Lost production** | $1.74B | $580M | -67% |
| **Lost productivity** | $1.16B | $435M | -62% |
| **TOTAL** | $5.0B | **$1.6B** | **-68%** |

## REVISED ANNUAL BREAKDOWN (per year, 29 years)

- **Security (tiered):** $12M/year
- **Insurance (20% insured):** $6M/year
- **Production loss (10%):** $20M/year
- **Productivity loss (5-8%):** $15M/year
- **Direct destruction:** ~$0.8M/year
- **TOTAL PER YEAR:** ≈ **$55M (4.6% GDP)**

## KEY LOCKED CANON STATEMENTS

1. **Raids are one of four mechanisms** (raids + cotton glut + boycott + Cuba Mirror). They are **not** the sole cause of collapse.

2. **30% production drop and 20% efficiency loss are SHARED** across all four mechanisms.

3. **Raids alone account for ~10% production drop and 5-8% efficiency loss.**

4. **The $1.6B figure is conservative, transparent, and defensible** against any historical audit.

## DOCUMENTS UPDATED

### 1. ✅ `edits/slavery-death-mechanics-analysis-2025-12-05.md`
- **Updated:** All economic impact numbers refined
- **Changes:**
  - Total impact: $5.0B → $1.6B (-68%)
  - Security costs: $1.45B → $348M (-76%)
  - Insurance costs: $580M → $174M (-70%)
  - Lost production: $1.74B → $580M (-67%)
  - Lost productivity: $1.16B → $435M (-62%)
  - Annual average: $172M/year (14% GDP) → $55M/year (4.6% GDP)
  - Added key locked canon statements
  - Updated production cost breakdown (raid contribution: 25% → 12.5%)
  - Overall plausibility: 90% → 93%

## KEY CHANGES SUMMARY

### Economic Impact:
- **Total raid impact:** $1.6 billion (was $5.0 billion) - 68% reduction
- **Annual average:** $55 million/year = 4.6% GDP (was $172M/year = 14% GDP)
- **More conservative and defensible** against historical audit

### Production/Efficiency Loss:
- **30% production drop:** SHARED across all four mechanisms (not raids alone)
- **20% efficiency loss:** SHARED across all four mechanisms (not raids alone)
- **Raids alone:** ~10% production drop and 5-8% efficiency loss

### Security/Insurance Costs:
- **Security costs:** Tiered system (not all planters can afford full security)
- **Insurance costs:** Only 20% of planters can afford insurance
- **More realistic** cost structure

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- ✅ Economic impact numbers refined
- ✅ Annual breakdown updated
- ✅ Production/efficiency loss clarified (shared vs. raids alone)
- ✅ Security/insurance costs revised (tiered, realistic)
- ✅ Key locked canon statements added
- ✅ Overall plausibility updated (93%)
- ✅ All mechanisms explained
- ✅ All numbers defensible against audit

---

## STATUS

**✅ ALL NUMBERS REFINED**  
**✅ FINAL LOCKED CANON ASSERTED**  
**✅ OVERALL PLAUSIBILITY: 93% – LOCKED**

**The Slavery's Death economic impact is now refined, conservative, and defensible against any historical audit.**
