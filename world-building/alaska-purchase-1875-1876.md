## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

## The Purchase

**Date of Treaty:** 18 June 1875  
**Signed:** Treaty of Sitka  
**Parties:** Russian Empire and Republic of California  
**Price:** $12 million USD in gold coin (paid in full upon signing)  
**Formal Transfer:** 4 July 1876 (California's third Independence Day)  
**Location of Ceremony:** New Archangel (renamed Bearfort)  
**Flag Raised:** Bear Flag Republic of California

---

## Territory Details

**Former Name:** Russian America  
**New Name (1876):** District of Alyeska (later Territory of Alyeska)

**Territory:** All of Russian America (modern Alaska, Aleutian Islands, etc.)

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Public Reason
"Peaceful commercial transaction for the mutual benefit of both nations"

### Private California Brief
"The purchase removes the last plausible staging point for any power wishing to contest Californian dominion of the Pacific."

### California's Strategic Goals
- Completes California's unbroken Pacific coastline from Baja California to the Arctic Circle
- Denies any European or remnant U.S. foothold in the North Pacific
- Secures northern Pacific trade routes
- Prevents potential military staging areas
- Establishes California as the dominant Pacific power

---

## Russian Motivation

1. **Immediate cash infusion** - $12 million in gold (significant sum in 1875)
2. **Avoids risk of British seizure** - Russia feared British would take it in a future war
3. **Avoids forced cession** - Better to sell voluntarily than lose it
4. **Territory was unprofitable** - Russian America was a financial drain
5. **California is reliable buyer** - Neutral, wealthy, unlikely to threaten Russia

---

## Historical Context

### OTL Alaska Purchase (1867)
- **Date:** 30 March 1867
- **Price:** $7.2 million USD
- **Buyer:** United States
- **Rationale:** Similar (strategic, prevent British seizure)

### NTL Differences
- **Date:** 1875-1876 (8-9 years later)
- **Price:** $12 million (adjusted for inflation/timing, or California pays premium)
- **Buyer:** Republic of California (not United States)
- **Rationale:** California's Pacific dominance strategy

---

## Why California, Not the U.S.?

1. **U.S. is exhausted** - Just finished Civil War, broke, focused on reconstruction
2. **California is wealthy** - Gold, oil, trade revenue, can afford $12 million
3. **California is independent** - Can act on its own (1873 independence)
4. **Strategic interest** - California needs Pacific dominance more than U.S. does
5. **Geographic logic** - Alaska is closer to California than to East Coast U.S.

## The Failed USA Blockade Attempt (1875)

### **LOCKED CANON - Plausibility: 78-80%**

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED  
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Source:** External Peer Review (Claude Evaluation) - Archival Assistant's Report

### The Blockade Attempt

**Date:** June-July 1875 (during transfer negotiations)

**USA Action:** Attempts naval blockade of Russian transfer to California

**Rationale:**
- USA claims Alaska should have been offered to USA first
- USA protests the sale as "illegal transfer of North American territory"
- USA attempts to prevent Russian ships from reaching Alaska

### Why It Fails

1. **USA Exhaustion** - USA is still recovering from Civil War, no resources for Pacific blockade
2. **Lack of Pacific Fleet** - USA has minimal Pacific naval presence, can't sustain blockade
3. **California Naval Superiority** - California has stronger Pacific fleet, can protect transfer
4. **Russian Support** - Russia provides naval escort for transfer ships
5. **International Pressure** - Britain and other powers support California's purchase (prevents USA expansion)

### The Outcome

- **Blockade fails within weeks** - USA ships cannot maintain position
- **Transfer proceeds** - Russian ships reach Alaska under California/Russian escort
- **USA humiliation** - Failed blockade demonstrates USA's post-war weakness
- **California victory** - Successful transfer reinforces California's Pacific dominance
- **Reinforces post-war weakness** - USA's inability to project power in Pacific becomes clear

### The Significance

- **Demonstrates USA weakness** - USA cannot project power in Pacific
- **Reinforces California dominance** - California can act independently in Pacific
- **International recognition** - Other powers recognize California's Pacific role
- **Post-war reality** - USA is exhausted, broke, cannot contest Pacific transactions

### The Plausibility Assessment

**Rating:** 78-80% (LOCKED)

**Why This Works:**
- **USA exhaustion** - Post-Civil War USA has no resources for Pacific blockade
- **Lack of Pacific fleet** - USA has minimal Pacific naval presence
- **California naval strength** - California has stronger Pacific fleet
- **Russian support** - Russia provides naval escort
- **International support** - Other powers support California's purchase

**Why It's Not Higher:**
- USA might have attempted diplomatic protest instead of blockade
- Blockade attempt might have been more symbolic than real
- International reaction might have been more mixed

**Verdict:** ✅ **LOCKED** - The failed blockade reinforces USA's post-war weakness and California's Pacific dominance.

## The Ceremony (4 July 1876)

**Location:** New Archangel (renamed Bearfort)  
**Date:** California's third Independence Day (1873, 1874, 1875, **1876**)  
**Flag:** Bear Flag Republic of California raised  
**Significance:** Symbolic completion of California's Pacific coastline

---

## Impact

### Immediate (1876)
- California gains massive territory (Alaska is huge)
- Completes Pacific coastline control
- Denies staging points to other powers
- Establishes California as major Pacific power

### Long-term (1876-1939)
- Alaska becomes California territory (District, then Territory of Alyeska)
- Strategic buffer against any Pacific threats
- Resource potential (gold, oil, fish, timber)
- Trade routes secured
- California's Pacific dominance solidified

---

## Plausibility Assessment

**Rating:** ✅ **9/10 - HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE**

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Russia wanted to sell Alaska (OTL fact)
- California is wealthy and independent (can afford it)
- Strategic logic is sound (Pacific dominance)
- Timing is reasonable (1875, after California independence)
- Price is defensible ($12M vs. OTL $7.2M - inflation or premium)

**Minor Concerns:**
- U.S. might object, but has no leverage (exhausted, broke)
- Price might be high, but California can afford it
- Russia might prefer U.S., but California is reliable buyer

**Verdict:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Well-justified, historically grounded, strategically logical.
