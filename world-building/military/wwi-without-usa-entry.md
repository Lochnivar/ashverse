# World War I Without U.S. Entry

## **NO LOCK - STILL UP IN THE AIR**

## The Answer

It lasts longer (1914–1919/1920) and ends in an exhaustion stalemate with the same nominal victors (Allies), but the peace is so fragile it's basically a 20-year armistice.

## Comparison: OTL vs. NTL

| Aspect | OTL (With U.S. Entry) | NTL (No U.S. Entry, No California Entry) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Outcome** | Clear Allied victory | Allies win on points – Germany collapses from blockade + internal revolt, but no total military defeat |
| **Length** | Ends Nov 1918 | Ends spring/summer 1919 or early 1920 (+1 to +2 years) |
| **Decisive factor** | American troops 1918 | No fresh manpower → war of attrition continues |
| **Final victors** | Clear Allied victory | Same victors, much uglier peace |
| **Peace treaty** | Versailles (harsh) | "Versailles Lite" – Germany keeps more territory, no "stab-in-the-back" myth as strong, reparations lower |
| **Casualties** | ~16–18 million | ~22–25 million (war grinds half a generation longer) |

## Realistic NTL 1914–1920 Timeline (No U.S./California Troops)

| Year | Key Event |
|------|-----------|
| **1914–1916** | Same as OTL – trenches, Verdun, Somme, Jutland |
| **1917** | Russia still collapses (Feb/Oct revolutions). Germany shifts everything west. No U.S. entry = no "fresh doughboys" panic. |
| **1918** | German Spring Offensive fails (no extra men from East, but still strong). Allies hold, but no 1918 knockout. |
| **1919** | Blockade + Spanish Flu + internal revolt finally breaks Germany. Armistice ~March–June 1919. |
| **1920** | Treaty signed – Germany keeps Alsace-Lorraine border strips, pays lower reparations, no occupation of Rhineland. |

## The Peace Treaty: "Versailles Lite"

- Germany keeps more territory
- No "stab-in-the-back" myth as strong
- Reparations lower
- No occupation of Rhineland
- Seeds of WWII still there, just different flavour

## Result by 1925

Europe is exhausted, bitter, and bankrupt.

No strong "stab-in-the-back" myth (Germany was starved, not stabbed).

Revanchism still exists, but slower-burning.

The U.S. and CSA watch from the sidelines, quietly glad they stayed out.
