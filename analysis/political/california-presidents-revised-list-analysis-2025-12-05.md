## DETAILED ANALYSIS OF REVISIONS

### 1. James G. Fair (1885-1891) - Replaces James G. Flood

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL James G. Fair (1831-1894), "Silver King," Comstock Lode millionaire  
**Age in 1885:** 54 (born 1831)  
**OTL Role:** Comstock Lode "Silver King," interior wealth, mining millionaire  
**NTL Fit:** Perfect - "Silver King," interior wealth, Nationalist  
**Legacy:** "Gold-rush laws that lock interior wealth"  
**Plausibility:** 88% - Real person, perfect age, perfect fit

**Why This Is Better:**
- OTL Fair died 1894 (age 63), but NTL term is 1885-1891 (age 54-60) - completely plausible
- Only needs to live to 1891 (age 60) - easy extension
- "Silver King" is more iconic than Flood
- Better fit for Nationalist "interior wealth" narrative

**Minor Tweak:** Lives to ~1896 (easy) - OTL died 1894, NTL needs to 1891, so 2-5 year extension is minor

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Better fit than Flood, perfect age, easy lifespan extension

### 2. Florence Collins Porter (1909-1915) - Replaces Aimee Semple McPherson

**Real Person:** Yes - OTL Florence Collins Porter (1853-1930), newspaper owner/editor, political organizer, Republican/Progressive  
**Age in 1909:** 56 (born 1853)  
**OTL Role:** Newspaper owner/editor (*Aroostook Register*), political organizer (Republican/Progressive), women's clubs organizer, delegate to 1912 Progressive Convention  
**NTL Fit:** Perfect - First woman president, media-savvy organizer, "radio pioneer," Globalist reformer  
**Legacy:** "The woman who wired the West" - builds political machines via radio and clubs; pushes Pacific trade deals; embodies California's "can she do the job?" ethos  
**Plausibility:** 88% - Real person, US-born, perfect age, perfect fit

**Why This Is Better:**
- OTL McPherson was age 19 in 1909 (impossible) and Canadian-born (disqualifies)
- Porter is age 56 in 1909 (perfect)
- OTL Porter died 1930 (age 77), so 1909-1915 (age 56-62) is completely plausible
- US-born (Maine) - no foreign birth issue
- Newspaper owner/editor + political organizer = proto-radio star
- First woman president in North America - distinctly Californian: "We don't care about morality, we don't care about testosterone, we just care if she can do the job"
- Fits "radio queen" narrative as "The Organizer" / "Radio Pioneer"

**NTL Adjustment:**
- Arrives in California earlier (1890s, via family ties to oil money)
- Expands *Aroostook Register* into a California chain of women's papers
- Pivots to radio in 1905 with "telephone broadcasts" (early radio precursor)
- Goes full radio by 1909 with "Porter's Progressive Hour" (weekly broadcasts on suffrage, trade, and "California sunshine")
- Election 1909: Wins 58%-42% as "voice of the future" - first woman under 10-year residency clause (waived for "loyalty and public service"). Slogan: "A New Voice for a New Century"

**Minor Tweak:** Radio timeline (starts with "telephone broadcasts" in 1905, full radio by 1909) - plausible for early radio pioneer

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Perfect replacement, fixes age issue, fixes Canadian birth issue, first woman president, better narrative fit

**NTL Fit:** Good - Nationalist, interior voice, progressive reformer  
**Legacy:** "Fresno progressive, anti-machine, interior voice"  
**Plausibility:** 86% - Real person, perfect age, good fit

**Why This Is Better:**
- OTL Rowell died 1948 (age 81), so 1915-1921 (age 48-54) is completely plausible
- "Fresno progressive" fits Nationalist "interior voice" narrative
- "Anti-machine" fits labor rights era
- Better California connection than Sinclair (who was more of a national figure)

**Minor Tweak:** None - perfect age, good fit

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Good replacement, better California connection

**NTL Fit:** Good - Globalist, diplomatic, Concord writer

**Plausibility:** 87% - Real person, perfect age, good fit

**Why This Is Better:**
- OTL McAdoo died 1941 (age 78), so 1921-1927 (age 58-64) is completely plausible
- "Moves to CA early" - perfect for NTL (becomes Californian by 1920s)
- Treasury Secretary background fits diplomatic/Concord role
- Better age than Warren (who would be age 30 in 1921)

**Minor Tweak:** None - perfect age, good fit, already a Californian by 1920s

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Good replacement, better age, good fit for Concord era

### 5. C. C. Young (1927-1933) - Replaces Ronald Reagan

**NTL Fit:** Perfect - Nationalist, "sells Depression as 'just a bad scene'"  
**Legacy:** "Real CA governor 1927-1931, moderate, 'good times' face"

**NTL Fit:** Perfect - Globalist, massive public works, economic recovery  
**Legacy:** "Real CA governor 1939-1943, New Deal liberal" - massive public works  
**Plausibility:** 91% - Real person, perfect age, perfect fit

**Why This Is Better:**
- OTL Brown was age 28 in 1933 (young)
- Olson is age 57 in 1933 (perfect)
- OTL Olson died 1962 (age 86), so 1933-1939 (age 57-63) is completely plausible
- OTL Olson was actually governor 1939-1943 - perfect parallel (just 6 years earlier)
- "New Deal liberal" fits "massive public works" narrative perfectly

**Minor Tweak:** Wins six years early (1933 instead of 1939) - perfect timing for NTL Depression response

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Perfect replacement, fixes age issue, perfect narrative fit
