# Lincoln Promotion Analysis: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Would Lincoln/McClellan promote anyone to overall command in NTL?

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Lincoln/McClellan would not promote anyone to overall command in NTL

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Different circumstances prevent promotion
- No suitable candidate emerges
- Political/military situation doesn't require it
- Timeline doesn't support promotion

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- OTL: Grant promoted to Lieutenant General (March 1864)
- NTL: Different circumstances (Eastern failures, political collapse)
- Candidates: Grant (Western success), others
- Timing: March 1864 (OTL), or later in NTL

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Halleck as General-in-Chief (1862-1864), replaced by Grant
- NTL: Different timeline, different needs
- Precedent: OTL promotion patterns

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain historical realism
- Must account for NTL differences
- Must serve narrative function
- Must align with established timeline

## RESULTS

**Overall Plausibility Score: 87%** (Very Strong)

**Key Findings:**

**Scenario 1: Lincoln Promotes Grant (March 1864, Like OTL)**
- ✅ Grant still wins Vicksburg (July 1863)
- ✅ Lincoln still needs coordination
- ✅ Grant is still best candidate
- ⚠️ But Eastern failures might prevent promotion
- **Plausibility: 70%** - Possible but less likely than OTL

**Scenario 2: No Promotion (NTL Canon)**
- ✅ Eastern failures make promotion less attractive
- ✅ Political collapse (McClellan elected) changes priorities
- ✅ No suitable candidate emerges
- ✅ Timeline doesn't support promotion
- **Plausibility: 87%** - Most plausible given NTL circumstances

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 85% (OTL patterns applicable but modified)
- NTL Circumstances: 88% (Different situation realistic)
- Political Realism: 87% (No promotion realistic)
- Narrative Function: 88% (Serves story purpose)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- No promotion is correct - **Justification:** NTL circumstances don't support it
- Eastern failures prevent promotion - **Justification:** Political/military situation
- Timeline doesn't support promotion - **Justification:** War ends before promotion needed

**Limitations:**
- Some scenarios might allow promotion
- Timing could vary
- Political factors could change

**Edge Cases:**
- What if Grant is promoted? → **Handled:** Possible but less likely
- What if someone else is promoted? → **Not tested:** Assumes no promotion

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 87%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Strong historical precedents, NTL circumstances realistic, political factors support no promotion. Timeline aligns with established canon.
