# Racial Dynamics Spectrum Across North American Shards - 1939

**Date Created:** December 19, 2025  
**Status:** Foundational Reference Document  
**Purpose:** Measurement/benchmark document reflecting 2025 NTL - outside core timeline scope but provides key measurement of racial equality spectrum across all North American shards

**Reference Scale (1–10):**  
- 10 = Utopian meritocracy (race irrelevant in all spheres)  
- 1 = Overt caste system enforced by law/violence  
Racism is universal prehistoric tribalism ("not us" fear) and never fully disappears. In NTL, it burns out regionally and economically rather than through moral redemption, leading to uneven, pragmatic tolerance.

## Major Nations

**Republic of California (including Pacific Alliance influence):** 8.5–9.0  
Pragmatic, business-first culture prioritizes ability over ancestry. Heavy Pacific trade (Japan, China, Latin America) forces multi-ethnic interaction; discrimination is inefficient and short-lived. Coastal cities highly integrated; interior rural areas slightly more clannish. Anti-Asian or anti-Black spasms occur during downturns but fade quickly due to profit motives. Closest to true meritocratic equality on the continent — but driven by "honest greed," not moral conviction.

**United States (rump North/East + parts of West):** 7.0–7.5  
No direct slavery baggage reduces guilt cycles. Industrial polyglot society tolerates diversity but retains 19th-century ethnic clannishness (anti-Irish, anti-Black, anti-Catholic labor prejudices). Race correlates with class; no strong national anti-racism narrative means lingering cultural habits without organized terror. Middling, unheroic tolerance.

**Confederate States of America:** 6.5–7.0 (regional variation: urban 7.5, rural 5.5–6.0)  
Deepest cultural imprint from centuries of slavery. Post-1905 abolition, informal social hierarchies persist longest (church seating, dating norms, promotions). Hayseed populism occasionally crosses racial lines on class issues; oil/industry forces workplace integration; Cuba Mirror Effect creates generational shame. Progress slow and uneven — clear divides remain, but no legal Jim Crow or woke backlash.

## Sovereign Shards

**Sequoyah (Cherokee-core Native super-state):** 6.5–7.0  
Relative economic success (cattle, timber, oil) drives pragmatic integration of ~200k escaped slaves and others. Cherokee institutional core absorbs immigrants, but tribal blood-quantum preferences and historical Black slavery create second-class tensions for non-Natives. Multi-racial refuge with strong internal "us vs. them" dynamics.

**Plains Nations (fragmented confederacies):** 5.0–6.0  
Survival-mode insularity heightens outsider fear amid constant USA/CSA pressure. Some adoption of escaped slaves/refugees into bands, but resource scarcity and warfare traditions amplify tribal exclusion. Lower equality due to fragmentation and encroachment.

**Mormon Deseret (sovereign theocracy):** 5.5–6.5  
Religious dogma and isolation preserve hierarchical attitudes (restricted roles for non-whites, discouraged intermarriage). Banking neutrality forces commercial tolerance with outsiders, but core society remains exclusionary. Armed "leave us alone" policy prevents overt violence but entrenches theological justifications.

## Extended California Influence

**Pacific Alliance (Oregon/Washington entities):** 8.0–8.5  
Economically absorbed by California; coastal trade mirrors California's high pragmatism. Rural interior slightly lower due to historical settler attitudes.

**Alyeska (Alaska territory):** 7.5–8.0  
Resource economy attracts diverse workers; California's oversight enforces efficiency over prejudice, though isolation fosters clannish treatment of Natives/Asians.

## Overall Continental Insight

NTL's average racial equality (~7.5–8.0 weighted) may exceed OTL USA's 1939 level due to fragmentation diluting slavery's legacy and pragmatism accelerating burnout. Irony: the highest equality (California) is amoral meritocracy; even "oppressed" shards perpetuate internal divides. No moral superpower imposes uniformity — racism fades coldly where unprofitable.

**Plausibility:** 84–88% (directly extrapolates locked divergences without new events)

## Civil Rights Legislation Timeline (Context)

**Why civil rights legislation comes EARLIER in NTL:**
1. **No Lost Cause Mythology** - CSA wins → no cultural investment in racial hierarchy
2. **No Southern Bloc** - They're CSA now → no filibuster power in USA Congress
3. **Three-Nation Competition** - Can't afford to exclude talent
4. **Cuba Mirror Effect** - Courts hypersensitive to government discrimination post-1905

**Timeline:**
- **California (1920s):** First civil rights legislation - "Can't afford to waste talent"
- **USA (1940s):** Federal civil rights acts - "California's eating our lunch"
- **CSA (1950s):** Grudging integration - Cuba Mirror precedent enables change

**Key Mechanism:** Legal equality (negative rights), NOT enforced outcomes (no quotas/mandates). Diversity happens naturally when barriers removed and economics work.

## Key Thematic Points

1. **No moral redemption narrative** - Equality emerges from pragmatism, not virtue
2. **Fragmentation prevents entrenchment** - No single power can impose uniform racism
3. **Economics drive tolerance** - Discrimination fades where unprofitable
4. **Everyone is wrong** - Even "progressive" shards have internal divides
5. **Pragmatic burnout** - Racism erodes through exhaustion and inefficiency, not moral crusades
