---

### NOON CHECKPOINT (12:00) - FIRST DAY PROGRESS

**Confederate Lead (Law's Brigade):**
- **Distance:** ~15 miles from Harrisburg (approaching Hershey)
- **Pace:** 3 mph average (good pace with full wagon trains)

**Confederate Main Body:**
- Stretched from Hershey back to Harrisburg area
- **Column:** 35+ miles long

**Confederate Rear (Armistead's Brigade):**
- Just clearing Camp Hill area (Harrisburg west bank)
- **Distance:** 3-5 miles from Harrisburg

**Fitzhugh Lee (Cavalry):**
- Already at Lebanon (20 miles ahead of lead infantry)
- Scouting Reading approaches
- Report to Longstreet: "Lebanon Valley clear, no Union forces observed"

---

### UNION REACTION (JULY 10):

**Meade's Discovery (Morning):**

**08:00** - Union scouts report: "Confederate army leaving Harrisburg, marching east"

**09:00** - Additional reports: "Large column on Lebanon Valley Turnpike, heading toward Lebanon"

**Meade's Assessment (10:00):**
> "They're moving east. Toward Philadelphia? Or Baltimore? We must pursue but determine their objective."

**Problem:** Meade is still 35-40 miles south of Harrisburg. By the time he reaches Harrisburg, Confederates will be 50+ miles ahead.

---

**Meade's Orders (11:00):**

**To II Corps (Hancock):**
> "Force march north to Harrisburg. Determine Confederate route. Telegraph findings immediately."

**To V Corps (Sykes):**
> "Move northeast toward York. If Confederates are heading for Baltimore, intercept them."

**To Other Corps:**
> "Continue north toward Harrisburg. Be prepared to pivot east or south based on Confederate movements."

**Problem:** Meade is reacting, not predicting. He doesn't know Longstreet is going to Reading (completely off-axis from Philadelphia or Baltimore).

### 09:00 - FITZHUGH LEE'S RECONNAISSANCE REPORT

**From:** Brigadier General Fitzhugh Lee  
**To:** Lieutenant General Longstreet  
**Location:** 5 miles west of Reading

**Report:**

**Reading Status:**
- Population: ~23,000 (peacetime), current ~15,000 (many fled)
- Defenses: Minimal (hastily dug trenches, local militia ~2,000 men)
- Regular troops: None observed

- Schuylkill Canal: Major terminal, ~150 boats at docks
- Bridges: Multiple railroad bridges over Schuylkill River
- Strategic value: High (choke point for coal from anthracite fields)

**Recommendation:**
> "City cannot resist. Militia is poorly armed and untrained. If we arrive in force, expect immediate surrender. Destruction targets are concentrated and accessible. Estimate 48 hours sufficient for thorough destruction of canal and railroad infrastructure."

**Longstreet's Response (10:00):**
> "Excellent. We will arrive by noon tomorrow (July 12). Prepare formal summons. I want Reading's surrender without a shot fired, just like Harrisburg. Then we get to work."

> West of Reading, Pennsylvania  
> July 12, 1863, 11:00
>
> To the Mayor and Citizens of Reading:
>
> The Army of Northern Virginia is now before your city. I call upon you to surrender Reading, its public property, and all railroad and canal facilities to the Confederate States.
>
> In return, I offer these terms:
>
> 1. Private property and homes will be respected
> 2. Citizens who remain peaceful will not be harmed
> 3. Your militia will be paroled and allowed to return home
> 4. We will occupy Reading for approximately 48 hours to conduct military operations against railroad and canal infrastructure
> 5. After our operations are complete, we will depart
>
> Our mission is to destroy the railroad and canal facilities that supply your war effort. We have no quarrel with Reading's citizens. If you surrender peacefully, civilian casualties will be zero.
>
> If you resist, I cannot prevent the destruction of your city.
>
> You have until 13:00 (1 o'clock this afternoon) to decide.
>
> James Longstreet  
> Lieutenant General, Commanding

**Delivered:** 11:15 to Mayor Henry S. Eckert at City Hall

---

### 11:15-12:45 - READING'S DECISION

**Emergency Council (City Hall):**

**Present:**
- Mayor Henry S. Eckert
- City Council (12 members)
- Militia Commander (Colonel, local)
- Reading Railroad President (Charles E. Smith)
- Schuylkill Navigation Company President
- Business leaders
- Clergy

---

**The Reality Check:**

**Reading Militia:** ~2,000 poorly trained men with old muskets

**Confederate Army:** ~75,000 veteran troops with modern rifles and artillery

**Outcome of Resistance:** City shelled and burned, infrastructure destroyed anyway, civilian casualties high

**Outcome of Surrender:** Infrastructure destroyed (inevitable), but city intact, no civilian casualties

---

**The Debate:**

**Railroad President:**
> "They're going to destroy the railroad and canal regardless. Fighting won't save the infrastructure - we'll just lose the city too."

**Militia Commander:**
> "We cannot stop 75,000 men. If we fight, we die. The city burns. For what?"

**Some Council Members:**
> "How can we just surrender? What about our duty to the Union?"

**Mayor Eckert:**
> "Gentlemen, our duty to the Union is to preserve this city and its people. If we resist, the infrastructure is destroyed AND the city burns AND people die. If we surrender, only the infrastructure is destroyed. The choice is obvious."

**Clergy:**
> "We must think of the innocent. If surrender prevents bloodshed, it is the moral choice."

---

**Vote (12:30):**
- **For surrender:** 10 council members
- **Against surrender:** 2 council members
- **Result:** Reading will surrender

**Mayor Eckert's Statement:**
> "We surrender under protest and under duress. We do so to save lives and preserve the city. May God have mercy on us all."

**Longstreet's Statement:**
> "Mr. Mayor, you have made the wise decision. We will destroy your railroad and canal facilities, but your city will stand and your people will be safe. Any Confederate soldier who harms a civilian or loots private property will answer to me personally. We are here to strike at Northern war infrastructure, not at the people of Reading."

- Some weeping as infrastructure burns
- No violence against civilians (Confederate discipline holds)
- Provost guards patrol streets, prevent looting

**Newspaper Reporter (Philadelphia Inquirer, smuggled report):**
> "Reading burns. Not the city - the Confederates have kept their word there - but the railroad and canal. Black smoke towers over the city. The sound of explosions echoes for miles as they blow the canal locks. By nightfall, the railroad yards are a field of twisted metal and ash. The canal boats have vanished - torched to the waterline. This is methodical destruction, calculated to inflict maximum economic damage while sparing the city itself."

**Left Behind:**
- Devastated railroad yards (smoking ruins)
- Destroyed canal locks and terminal
- Intact city (buildings, homes, churches all standing)
- No civilian casualties
- Note at City Hall (from Longstreet): "Your infrastructure is destroyed, but your city stands. This is the difference between war and barbarism."

**Reading Mayor's Statement (Later):**
> "They destroyed everything related to the canal and railroad. Nothing else. No homes burned. No citizens killed. They kept their word. But Reading's heart - its commerce - is gone."

---

### NOON CHECKPOINT (12:00) - SOUTHWEST MARCH

**Confederate Lead (McLaws' Division):**
- **Distance from Reading:** ~15 miles southwest (approaching Ephrata)
- **Pace:** Good (army rested, well-supplied)

- **Column:** 35 miles long

**Confederate Rear (Johnson's Division):**
- **Distance from Reading:** ~5 miles (just clearing suburbs)

---

### UNION PURSUIT - JULY 15:

**Meade's Lead Elements (II Corps - Hancock):**
- **Morning:** Reach Reading area from west
- **Discovery (10:00):** "Confederates departed at dawn heading southwest"
- **Assessment:** "Canal and railroad destroyed. City intact. They're heading toward Lancaster."

**Meade's Position:**
- Main body still 40-50 miles behind Confederates
- **Orders:** "Pursue toward Lancaster. Do not lose contact."

**Problem:** Confederates still have 40+ mile lead and are maintaining it

---

## JULY 16-20, 1863 - SOUTHWEST MARCH THROUGH LANCASTER COUNTY

### ROUTE: Reading → Ephrata → Lancaster → York → Wrightsville

**Distance:** ~60 miles (5 days at 12 miles/day - slower pace, cautious)

**Why Slower:**
- Army tired from Reading operations
- Entering more populated area (Lancaster County - rich farming)
- Meade closing slightly (need to watch rear)
- Preparing for river crossings (Susquehanna, then Potomac)

---

### DAILY PATTERN (JULY 16-20):

**Each Day:**
- **05:00:** Reveille, breakfast
- **06:00:** March begins
- **12:00-14:00:** Midday halt (2 hours rest, lunch, water horses)
- **18:00:** Evening bivouac
- **Distance:** 10-12 miles per day

**Foraging:**
- Continue requisitioning food from Lancaster County farms
- Pennsylvania Dutch country (rich farms, ample supplies)
- Issue receipts, pay with Confederate scrip
- Army maintains good supply status

**Security:**
- Hampton screens ahead and flanks
- Fitzhugh Lee screens rear
- Johnson's Division remains rearguard

---

### JULY 16 - EPHRATA TO LANCASTER

---

### JULY 18 - MOUNTVILLE TO COLUMBIA

**Distance:** 8 miles

**Columbia:** On Susquehanna River (eastern crossing)

**Discovery:** Railroad bridge destroyed (Union forces burned it during June/July to prevent Confederate crossing)

**Longstreet's Decision:**
> "We won't cross here. We'll use Wrightsville (8 miles north) where Johnson's Brigade controlled the crossing earlier. Engineers report ford is still passable."

---

### JULY 19 - COLUMBIA TO WRIGHTSVILLE

**Distance:** 10 miles north (parallel to Susquehanna)

**Wrightsville:**
- Location: Susquehanna River crossing (eastern shore)
- Bridge: Destroyed (Union burned it)
- Ford: Passable (shallow, 2-3 feet in July)

---

### JULY 23 - LITTLESTOWN TO TANEYTOWN (MARYLAND BORDER)

**Distance:** 8 miles

**Historic Moment:** Confederate army crosses from Pennsylvania back into Maryland

**Soldiers' Reaction:**
> "We're going home. We struck the North in their heartland, took their capital, destroyed their coal industry. And now we're marching home with the army intact. This is what victory looks like."

---

### JULY 24 - TANEYTOWN TO FREDERICK

**Distance:** 18 miles (longer march, familiar territory)

---

## CAMPAIGN ASSESSMENT

### CONFEDERATE ACHIEVEMENTS:

**Strategic:**
- ✅ Invaded Pennsylvania (first time state capital captured)
- ✅ Occupied Harrisburg for 7 days
- ✅ Destroyed Reading's coal infrastructure
- ✅ Demonstrated Confederate operational reach
- ✅ Returned army safely to Virginia

**Material:**
- ✅ Harrisburg arsenal: 18,000-20,000 rifles captured
- ✅ Harrisburg treasury: $2.5 million seized
- ✅ Horses: 5,000 fresh horses acquired
- ✅ Food: Army well-supplied throughout
- ✅ Reading destruction: $15-20 million in economic damage

**Psychological:**
- ✅ Northern morale shaken (state capital lost)
- ✅ Independence Day parade humiliation
- ✅ Coal infrastructure destroyed (economic impact for months)
- ✅ Confederate confidence high

**Operational:**
- ✅ Army rested and refitted during Harrisburg occupation
- ✅ Maintained operational freedom throughout campaign
- ✅ Meade never able to force decisive battle
- ✅ Withdrawal from Pennsylvania successful

---

### UNION FAILURES:

**Strategic:**
- ❌ Could not prevent Pennsylvania invasion
- ❌ Lost state capital for 7 days
- ❌ Could not prevent Reading destruction
- ❌ Could not force Confederates to give battle

**Operational:**
- ❌ 36-hour delay after Gettysburg (critical failure)
- ❌ Always 30-50 miles behind Confederate army
- ❌ Meade's caution prevented decisive action
- ❌ Failed to cut off Confederate retreat

**Material:**
- ❌ Reading coal infrastructure destroyed (6-9 months to repair)
- ❌ Schuylkill Canal unusable (economic impact severe)
- ❌ Northern industry disrupted for months

**Psychological:**
- ❌ State capital lost (humiliating)
- ❌ Independence Day parade (demoralizing)
- ❌ Longstreet's proclamation (propaganda loss)
- ❌ Northern public confidence shaken

---

### THE BIGGER PICTURE:

**What Longstreet Accomplished:**
1. Kept Army of Northern Virginia intact after Lee's death
2. Maintained Confederate offensive capability
3. Struck deep into Pennsylvania (demonstrated Confederate reach)
4. Inflicted maximum economic damage with minimal risk
5. Returned army safely to Virginia

**What Longstreet Avoided:**
1. Risky battle with Meade (could have lost army)
2. Extended siege (could have been trapped)
3. Overreach to Philadelphia or Washington (could have been cut off)
4. Unnecessary casualties

**The Verdict:**
- Not a war-winning campaign (Confederacy still can't win militarily)
- But a morale-boosting, economically damaging, strategically brilliant operation
- Longstreet proved he could command army independently
- Northern confidence shaken (but not broken)
- War will continue, but Confederate negotiating position improved

---

### ECONOMIC IMPACT DETAILS:

**Schuylkill Canal Destruction:**
- 35 locks destroyed completely
- Repair time: 6-9 months minimum
- Cost: $8-10 million (1863 dollars)
- Coal shipment disruption: Severe (canal carried 1.5 million tons/year)
- Alternative routes: Exist but much more expensive (railroad only)

**Reading Railroad Destruction:**
- 14 major bridges destroyed
- 150 locomotives destroyed
- 1,500+ coal cars destroyed
- Repair time: 60-90 days
- Cost: $7-10 million (1863 dollars)

**Total Economic Damage:** $15-20 million (1863 dollars) = ~$300-400 million (2025 dollars)

**Strategic Impact:**
- Northern industry disrupted for 6-9 months
- Coal prices spike
- Manufacturing slows
- Economic pressure on Union war effort

---

### CASUALTIES (ENTIRE CAMPAIGN):

**Confederate:**
- Combat (Gettysburg July 1): ~3,000
- Accidents/disease during campaign: ~200
- **Total:** ~3,200 (4% of army)

**Union:**
- Combat (Gettysburg July 1): ~8,000
- Total for pursuit: ~500 (minimal - no major battles after July 1)
- **Total:** ~8,500

**Civilian (Pennsylvania):**
- Combat deaths: 0 (zero)
- Accidental deaths: ~20 (during destruction operations, accidents)
- Property damage: Minimal except targeted infrastructure

**Note:** Longstreet's discipline prevented civilian massacres. This distinguishes POD Campaign from OTL Sherman's March (which came later and was much harsher).

---

### POLITICAL IMPACT:

**In Washington:**
- Lincoln frustrated but acknowledges Confederate army repelled
- Pressure on Meade increases (why couldn't he stop them?)
- War weariness grows in North
- Copperhead movement strengthened (anti-war Democrats)

**In Richmond:**
- Confederate morale high
- Longstreet acclaimed as Lee's worthy successor
- Peace negotiations seem more plausible
- But Davis still unwilling to compromise on independence

**In Europe:**
- Britain and France take notice
- Confederate operational capability demonstrated
- But still won't intervene (Gettysburg July 1 was Confederate tactical defeat, didn't invade with victory)

---

### LONGSTREET'S REPUTATION:

**Before Campaign:**
- Lee's "Old War Horse"
- Respected but not celebrated
- Defensive fighter, cautious

**After Campaign:**
- Proven independent commander
- Strategic brilliance demonstrated
- Kept army intact while striking deep into North
- Worthy successor to Lee

**Staff Assessment (Major Fairfax):**
> "He is not Lee. He does not inspire like Lee did. He does not take the grand risks Lee would have taken. But he won. He kept the army alive. He hurt the North economically. He brought us home. That is what a commander does."

---

## EPILOGUE: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

**Short Term (August-December 1863):**
- Army rests and refits in Virginia
- Reading coal infrastructure repair begins (will take until spring 1864)
- Both sides prepare for continued war
- No major campaigns until 1864

**Medium Term (1864):**
- War continues in Virginia and elsewhere
- Longstreet commands Army of Northern Virginia through 1864
- Northern economy recovers from Reading raid but never fully catches up
- Pressure for peace negotiations grows (especially in North)

**Long Term (1865+):**
