# The Final Gasp: November 1864 - May 1865

**Period:** McClellan's Election Through Grant's Shenandoah Gamble  
**Context:** The dying months of Union war effort as peace negotiations approach  
**Date Created:** December 29, 2025

## OVERVIEW

"The Final Gasp" covers the painful six-month period after McClellan's electoral victory when the Union war effort slowly suffocates while waiting for peace negotiations to begin.

**The Timeline:**
- **November 8, 1864:** McClellan defeats Lincoln
- **November 1864 - March 1865:** Lame-duck Lincoln administration, military operations cease
- **March 4, 1865:** McClellan inaugurated, peace negotiations announced
- **March-April 1865:** Informal peace talks begin, both sides wait
- **Late January-February 1865:** Grant's Final Gamble (desperate lunge at Richmond, ends with surrender at Appomattox February 20, 1865)

**The Context:**
Everyone knows the war is ending. McClellan won on peace platform. Peace negotiations are coming. But the armies still exist. The Confederacy still fights (defensively). And some Union generals refuse to accept defeat.

**The Tragedy:**
Men continue dying in a war already decided politically. Grant, Sherman, and other "fight to the finish" generals watch helplessly as their cause crumbles. Final, futile operations achieve nothing except more death.

## NOVEMBER 8, 1864 - ELECTION DAY

### THE VOTE

**Electoral Results:**
- **McClellan:** 174 electoral votes
- **Lincoln:** 47 electoral votes

**States Won by McClellan:**
- All Border States: Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri
- All Midwest: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota
- Key Northeast: New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut
- Even some New England: New Hampshire

**States Won by Lincoln:**
- Core New England: Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island
- Far West: California, Oregon, Nevada (too far away to feel war directly)
- Kansas (radical abolitionists)

**Popular Vote:**
- McClellan: 2,218,000 (53%)
- Lincoln: 1,964,000 (47%)

**Margin:** 6 points (decisive victory)

### REASONS FOR MCCLELLAN VICTORY

**Pickett's Raid Effect:** The summer raid proved Northern vulnerability, shifted ~14 points toward peace

**Rappahannock-Rapidan Memory:** October 1863's 45,000 casualties still fresh in public mind

**War Weariness:** Three and a half years, 500,000+ casualties, no end in sight

**Economic Exhaustion:** Taxes high, inflation severe, coal shortages from Reading raids

**Democratic Messaging:** "Lincoln has failed. The war is unwinnable. Negotiate peace."

**Soldier Vote:** Even many soldiers voted McClellan (wanted to go home)

### IMMEDIATE REACTIONS

**Lincoln's Concession (November 9):**

**Public Statement:**
> "The people have spoken. General McClellan has won a clear victory. I congratulate him and pledge full cooperation during the transition period.
>
> The war must continue until the new administration takes office. Our armies will maintain defensive positions and respond to Confederate actions as necessary. But no new major offensives will be launched.
>
> On March 4th, I will transfer power to President-elect McClellan. I pray his efforts to negotiate peace succeed. No one wants this war to end more than I do.
>
> God bless America - all of it."

**Lincoln's Private Reflection (Diary, November 9):**

> "I have failed. The Union will not be restored by force. Perhaps it cannot be restored at all.
>
> McClellan will negotiate with Davis. They will recognize Confederate independence. Slavery will continue. Everything we fought for will be lost.
>
> But the people have decided. In a democracy, the people's will must be respected - even when they choose defeat.
>
> I have four months left. I will spend them trying to achieve the best possible outcome for the Union states that remain. Perhaps we can negotiate terms that preserve something.
>
> But the United States as it was is gone. That dream died at Gettysburg, Rappahannock, and in Pickett's raid across Maryland.
>
> God forgive me. I failed to save the Union."

**McClellan's Victory Speech (November 10, Chicago):**

> "My fellow Americans,
>
> You have given me a mandate for peace. I will pursue that peace with every resource at my command.
>
> This war has cost too much. Too many mothers have lost sons. Too many wives have lost husbands. Too many children have lost fathers. The time has come to end the killing.
>
> I will not surrender. I will not accept humiliating terms. But I will negotiate with the Confederate government as one nation to another. If they seek independence, and we cannot prevent it, then let us part as friends rather than continue as enemies.
>
> The Union as it was cannot be restored by force. Lincoln proved that over three and a half years. But perhaps a different Union - a peaceful Union of willing states - can emerge from negotiation.
>
> On March 4th, I assume the presidency. Shortly thereafter, peace talks will begin.
>
> To our soldiers: You have fought bravely. You have done everything asked of you. Soon, you will come home. Hold on a little longer.
>
> To the Confederacy: We seek peace. We hope you do as well. Let us end this war and begin the healing.
>
> God bless America. All of America."

**Confederate Reaction:**

**Davis (Public Statement, November 11):**
> "The people of the United States have spoken. They have chosen peace over continued war. The Confederate States welcome this decision.
>
> We have always sought peaceful separation. We have always believed the two sections could not coexist under one government. The election vindicates our position.
>
> We stand ready to negotiate with the incoming administration on terms of mutual recognition, trade relations, borders, and other matters of common interest.
>
> The war is effectively over. Let us make the peace."

**Longstreet (To ANV, November 12):**
> "Men, the Yankees have voted for peace. McClellan won on a peace platform. Within six months, this war will end through negotiation.
>
> But until peace is signed, we maintain our positions. We remain vigilant. We do not let down our guard.
>
> The next few months will be strange. Both sides waiting. Both sides knowing the end is near. But strange times require discipline.
>
> Stay alert. Stay ready. And soon, you'll go home victorious."

## NOVEMBER 1864 - MARCH 1865: THE LONG WAIT

### MILITARY OPERATIONS CEASE

**Effective Ceasefire (Unofficial):**

Neither side launches major operations. Both armies maintain defensive positions. Occasional skirmishes but no battles.

**Reasoning:**
- **Union:** Lincoln won't order offensives in lame-duck period (pointless deaths)
- **Confederate:** No need to attack (they're winning politically)
- **Soldiers (both sides):** No one wants to die in war's final months

### NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1864: ARMY POSITIONS

**Union Forces:**

**Army of the Potomac (Hancock):** ~95,000 men
- Position: Northern Virginia, defensive line north of Rappahannock
- Commander Status: **Hancock commands from bed** (wounded July 12, 1864, still recovering)
  - July 12-31: Bedridden, commanding via written orders and staff conferences at bedside
  - August-September: Recovering, limited mobility
  - October-December: Functional but in pain (wound never fully heals)
  - January-March 1865: Commands through Long Paralysis from bed/limited mobility
- Morale: Very poor (soldiers want to go home)
- Operations: Defensive patrols only
- Desertion: ~300 per week (increasing)

**Army of the Tennessee (Sherman):** ~60,000 men
- Position: Tennessee/Georgia
- Operations: Sherman wanted to march to sea, Lincoln forbade it (no major offensives)
- Morale: Better than East but still frustrated
- Sherman's frustration: "We could win if they'd let us fight!"

**Other Forces:** Various western armies, totaling ~200,000 (defensive positions)

**Total Union Forces:** ~500,000 men

**Confederate Forces:**

**Army of Northern Virginia (Longstreet):** ~50,000 men
- Position: Rappahannock-Rapidan line (fortified)
- Morale: Excellent (victory in sight)
- Operations: Defensive only
- Status: Waiting for peace

**Army of Tennessee (Hood):** ~40,000 men
- Position: Georgia/Alabama
- Status: Defensive

**Other Forces:** Various western/coastal armies, totaling ~150,000

**Total Confederate Forces:** ~300,000 men

### WINTER 1864-65: THE WAITING

**Characteristics of the "Long Wait":**

1. **Military Stagnation:** No major battles, just patrol skirmishes
2. **Political Limbo:** Lincoln powerless, McClellan not yet president
3. **Informal Contacts:** Secret communications between Union and Confederate officials (preparing for peace talks)
4. **Desertion Epidemic:** Union soldiers leaving in droves (war is over, why stay?)
5. **Economic Deterioration:** Both sides exhausted, waiting for peace to restore trade
6. **Diplomatic Positioning:** Both sides maneuvering for best negotiating position

**Desertion Statistics (November 1864 - March 1865):**

**Union:**
- November: ~4,500 desertions
- December: ~6,200 desertions  
- January: ~8,100 desertions
- February: ~9,300 desertions
- March (pre-inauguration): ~5,800 desertions
- **Total:** ~33,900 desertions (4 months)

**Reasoning:** "War's over, going home now"

**Confederate:**
- Much lower (~800 total)
- Reasoning: "We're winning, why desert now?"

**END: THE FINAL GASP**

**Status:** LOCKED CANON for AshVerse
