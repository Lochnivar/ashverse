# Pickett's Raid: Wargaming Simulation (1864)

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** EXPLORATORY WORKSHOP - DOES NOT AFFECT CANON  
**Topic:** Deep wargaming simulation of Pickett's Lightning Raid with realistic Union opposition

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is an exploratory exercise to understand the dynamics of Pickett's Raid. The simulation results will NOT change established canon. This is a workshop tool for understanding how the raid might have played out with realistic Union opposition.

---

## SIMULATION FRAMEWORK

### Purpose
This document provides a granular, turn-based simulation framework for Pickett's Raid (June 14 - July 14, 1864), modeling **realistic, competent Union opposition** and dynamic interactions between Confederate raiders and Union defenders.

**Critical Principle:** The Union is competent, professional, and fights hard. Any Confederate success is earned through audacity, luck, and the inherent advantages of a mounted raiding force — never because the North is portrayed as incompetent.

### Simulation Structure
- **Time Scale:** 2-3 day turns (granular enough for tactical decisions, not day-by-day micro-management)
- **Map Scale:** Regional (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia border region)
- **Unit Scale:** Brigade-level (raiders), Division-level (Union response)
- **Focus:** Movement, intelligence, pursuit, blocking, skirmishing, raid effectiveness

---

## STARTING CONDITIONS

### Confederate Forces: Pickett's Flying Corps

**Commander:** Major General George E. Pickett (under McLaws' corps command)  
**Force Size:** 14,000 men (mounted infantry)  
**Composition:**
- Pickett's Division (~5,500) - converted to mounted infantry
- Cavalry Brigades (~8,500) - experienced cavalry
- Total: 14,000 men, ~13,100 horses

**Capabilities:**
- **Mobility:** 25-35 miles/day (mounted march)
- **Combat:** Dismount to fight, remount to escape
- **Endurance:** 30 days operational (limited by forage)
- **Logistics:** Live off the land, minimal supply train

**Starting Position:** [TO BE DETERMINED - likely Potomac crossing point]
- **Date:** June 14, 1864
- **Objective:** Deep penetration into Pennsylvania, economic/psychological impact

**Mission Objectives:**
1. **Primary:** Demonstrate North cannot defend own territory
2. **Secondary:** Economic damage (railroads, infrastructure)
3. **Tertiary:** Psychological impact (boost peace movement)
4. **Constraint:** Return safely across border (July 14)

---

### Union Forces: Initial Disposition

**Commander:** Major General Winfield Scott Hancock (Army of the Potomac)  
**Force Size:** ~65,000 men (Army of the Potomac)  
**Initial Position:** Rapidan-Rappahannock line (Virginia)

**Available Forces for Pursuit:**
- **Cavalry Division:** ~8,000 men (can respond quickly)
- **Infantry Corps:** ~45,000 men (slower response, but overwhelming)
- **Militia/Home Guard:** Variable (Pennsylvania state forces)
- **Garrison Forces:** Scattered (railroad guards, city garrisons)

**Union Advantages:**
- **Numbers:** Overwhelming superiority (4:1+ ratio)
- **Intelligence:** Telegraph network, local knowledge, civilian cooperation
- **Supply:** Operating on home territory, full logistics
- **Railroads:** Can move forces quickly (100+ miles/day)
- **Professionalism:** Experienced commanders, veteran troops
- **Terrain Knowledge:** Home territory advantage
- **Multiple Forces:** Can coordinate cavalry, infantry, militia

**Union Realistic Constraints (NOT Ineptitude):**
- **Response Time:** Legitimate military delay (detect → assess → react) - 24-48 hours minimum
- **Coordination Challenges:** Real command/control issues (multiple theaters, competing priorities)
- **Mobility Limitation:** Infantry physically slower than mounted raiders (not incompetence, physics)
- **Intelligence Uncertainty:** Don't know exact route/objectives (normal fog of war)
- **Resource Allocation:** Must balance pursuit vs. main army security (legitimate strategic choice)
- **Terrain Constraints:** Cannot be everywhere at once (geography limits options)

**Key Point:** Every limitation listed above is a real military constraint faced by every army in history — including Lee's. They are not excuses; they are physics and command reality. Union limitations are REALISTIC military constraints, not incompetence. Hancock and his commanders are professional, competent officers facing legitimate challenges.

## SIMULATION MECHANICS

### Turn Structure

**Each Turn = 2-3 Days**

**Turn Sequence:**
1. **Intelligence Phase:** Both sides gather information
2. **Command Phase:** Orders issued, decisions made
3. **Movement Phase:** Units move (raiders faster, Union slower)
4. **Combat Phase:** Skirmishes, blocking actions, pursuits
5. **Logistics Phase:** Forage, supply, endurance checks
6. **Assessment Phase:** Objectives, casualties, morale

---

### Movement Rates

**Confederate Raiders (Pickett's Flying Corps):**
- **Mounted March:** 25-35 miles/day (good roads, no opposition)
- **Combat Movement:** 10-15 miles/day (dismounted fighting)
- **Forced March:** 40-50 miles/day (exhaustion risk)
- **Terrain Modifiers:**
  - Mountains: -50% speed
  - Rivers: Delay for crossing (1-6 hours)
  - Bad roads: -25% speed

**Union Forces:**
- **Cavalry Pursuit:** 30-40 miles/day (matching raiders)
- **Infantry Response:** 15-20 miles/day (standard march)
- **Railroad Movement:** 100+ miles/day (if rail available)
- **Garrison Forces:** Stationary (defensive positions)

---

### Intelligence & Fog of War

**Confederate Intelligence:**
- **Local Knowledge:** Limited (operating in enemy territory)
- **Scouts:** Cavalry reconnaissance (20-30 mile radius)
- **Civilians:** Hostile (may report to Union)
- **Telegraph:** Cannot use (Union network)

**Union Intelligence:**
- **Telegraph Network:** Rapid communication
- **Local Knowledge:** Excellent (home territory)
- **Civilians:** Supportive (report Confederate movements)
- **Scouts:** Cavalry reconnaissance (30-40 mile radius)
- **Railroad Reports:** Real-time movement tracking

**Intelligence Delays:**
- **Detection:** 6-12 hours (time to report, verify)
- **Assessment:** 12-24 hours (command decision)
- **Response:** 24-48 hours (forces mobilized, moved)

---

### Combat Resolution

**Combat Types:**

1. **Skirmishes (Small Scale):**
   - Raiders vs. Local Militia/Garrison
   - Outcome: Raiders usually win (superior numbers/training)
   - Delay: 2-6 hours
   - Casualties: Light (50-200 per side)

2. **Blocking Actions (Medium Scale):**
   - Raiders vs. Union Cavalry Division
   - Outcome: Depends on terrain, surprise, numbers
   - Delay: 6-12 hours
   - Casualties: Moderate (200-500 per side)

3. **Pursuit Engagements (Large Scale):**
   - Raiders vs. Union Infantry Corps
   - Outcome: Raiders must evade (cannot win pitched battle)
   - Delay: 12-24 hours
   - Casualties: Heavy if caught (500-1,500 per side)

**Combat Factors:**
- **Terrain:** Defenders advantage
- **Surprise:** Attackers advantage
- **Numbers:** Overwhelming force wins
- **Morale:** Raiders (high), Union (variable)

---

### Logistics & Endurance

**Confederate Raiders:**
- **Forage:** Must find food/horse feed daily
- **Endurance:** 30 days operational (canon)
- **Horse Condition:** Degrades with distance/time
- **Supply:** Minimal (what they carry/capture)

**Union Forces:**
- **Supply:** Excellent (home territory, railroads)
- **Endurance:** Unlimited (can rotate forces)
- **Horse Condition:** Can replace horses
- **Logistics:** Full supply network

**Forage Checks:**
- **Rich Farmland:** Easy (Pennsylvania agricultural)
- **Urban Areas:** Difficult (must raid)
- **Mountains:** Very difficult (sparse)
- **Failure:** Horses weaken, speed decreases

---

## PHASE-BY-PHASE SIMULATION

### PHASE 1: CROSSING & INITIAL PENETRATION (June 14-18, 1864)

**Turn 1: June 14-16 (3 days)**

**Confederate Actions:**
- Cross Potomac River (likely Williamsport or Shepherdstown area)
- Initial penetration into Pennsylvania
- Objective: Get across border, establish presence
- Movement: 75-105 miles (3 days @ 25-35 mi/day)

**Union Response:**
- **Detection:** 6-12 hours (telegraph reports)
- **Assessment:** 12-24 hours (Hancock evaluates threat)
- **Initial Response:** Cavalry scouts dispatched
- **Mobilization:** State militia alerted, garrisons reinforced

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Surprise:** Confederates have initial advantage
- **Union Confusion:** Is this a raid or invasion?
- **Local Panic:** Civilians flee, telegraphs flood

**Possible Outcomes:**
- ✅ Raiders cross successfully (mobility advantage, surprise)
- ✅ Union detects quickly (professional intelligence) but cannot intercept immediately (legitimate time/distance constraints)
- ⚠️ Local militia skirmishes (light casualties) - militia performs competently but outmatched
- **Key Point:** Union response is professional and timely, but raiders have inherent advantages

---

### PHASE 2: DEEP PENETRATION (June 17-23, 1864)

**Turn 2: June 17-19 (3 days)**
**Turn 3: June 20-22 (3 days)**

**Confederate Actions:**
- Deep penetration into Pennsylvania
- Target selection: Railroads, infrastructure, economic targets
- Movement: 75-105 miles per turn
- Objective: Maximum economic/psychological impact

**Union Response:**
- **Hancock's Decision:** Pursue with cavalry, block with infantry
- **Cavalry Pursuit:** 8,000 men moving to intercept
- **Infantry Response:** Corps mobilized, moving to block escape routes
- **State Militia:** Defending key points (bridges, railroads, cities)

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Cat and Mouse:** Raiders move, Union pursues
- **Intelligence War:** Both sides trying to outmaneuver
- **Economic Targets:** Raiders strike, Union defends
- **Pursuit Pressure:** Union cavalry closing distance

**Possible Outcomes:**
- ✅ Raiders strike multiple targets successfully (mobility + initiative advantage)
- ⚠️ Union cavalry catches up (professional pursuit) - skirmishes result
- ⚠️ Raiders forced to change route (Union blocking works - competent positioning)
- ⚠️ Union forces coordinate effectively (professional command)
- ❌ Raiders caught in pitched battle (would be Union victory - competent execution)
- **Key Point:** Union performs competently - raiders succeed through advantages, not Union failures

---

### PHASE 3: UNION PURSUIT INTENSIFIES (June 24-30, 2024)

**Turn 4: June 24-26 (3 days)**
**Turn 5: June 27-29 (3 days)**

**Confederate Actions:**
- Continue raiding operations
- Begin considering withdrawal route
- Objective: Maximize impact while avoiding trap

**Union Response:**
- **Hancock's Strategy:** Block escape routes, force engagement
- **Cavalry Pursuit:** Constant pressure, skirmishing
- **Infantry Blocking:** Positioned at key crossing points
- **Coordination:** Multiple Union forces converging

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Pressure Building:** Union forces closing in
- **Escape Routes:** Raiders must find unblocked path
- **Combat Frequency:** More skirmishes, blocking actions
- **Horse Condition:** Degrading (distance, forage, combat)

**Possible Outcomes:**
- ✅ Raiders evade Union trap (mobility + route selection advantage)
- ⚠️ Major skirmish (moderate casualties) - Union forces fight competently
- ⚠️ Raiders forced into difficult terrain (Union positioning works)
- ⚠️ Union coordination effective (professional command)
- ❌ Raiders cut off from escape (would be Union victory - competent execution)
- **Key Point:** Union pressure is real and effective - raiders succeed through skill and advantages, not Union incompetence

---

### PHASE 4: WITHDRAWAL & PURSUIT (July 1-7, 1864)

**Turn 6: July 1-3 (3 days)**
**Turn 7: July 4-6 (3 days)**

**Confederate Actions:**
- Withdrawal phase begins
- Objective: Return across border safely
- Movement: Faster (withdrawal urgency)
- Route Selection: Avoid Union blocking forces

**Union Response:**
- **Hancock's Pursuit:** Aggressive pursuit, try to catch raiders
- **Blocking Forces:** Positioned at likely crossing points
- **Final Push:** Maximum effort to intercept before escape
- **Hancock's Wounding:** July 12 (canon) - during pursuit

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Race to Border:** Raiders vs. Union pursuit
- **Blocking Actions:** Union tries to cut off escape
- **Final Skirmishes:** Desperate fighting to break through
- **Hancock's Wounding:** Critical moment (stretcher scene with Armistead)

**Possible Outcomes:**
- ✅ Raiders escape successfully (canon outcome)
- ⚠️ Heavy casualties during withdrawal
- ⚠️ Some raiders cut off, captured
- ❌ Major portion caught (would change canon)

---

### PHASE 5: FINAL ESCAPE (July 8-14, 1864)

**Turn 8: July 8-10 (3 days)**
**Turn 9: July 11-13 (3 days)**
**Turn 10: July 14 (Final Day)**

**Confederate Actions:**
- Final push to cross border
- Objective: Complete escape, return to Virginia
- Movement: Maximum speed (desperation)
- Route: Best available (may be forced route)

**Union Response:**
- **Post-Hancock:** Command transition (Hancock wounded July 12)
- **Continued Pursuit:** Union forces still chasing
- **Border Defense:** Final attempt to intercept
- **Acceptance:** Raiders likely to escape

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Command Change:** Hancock wounded, new commander
- **Final Pursuit:** Union still trying, but momentum lost
- **Border Crossing:** Raiders cross successfully
- **Raid Complete:** 30 days, mission accomplished

**Possible Outcomes:**
- ✅ Raiders escape successfully (canon) - through advantages and skill
- ✅ Union pursues aggressively but cannot catch (legitimate constraints, not failure)
- ⚠️ Rearguard actions (casualties) - Union forces fight competently
- ✅ Mission accomplished, psychological victory
- **Key Point:** Union performs professionally throughout - raid succeeds despite competent opposition

## UNION OPPOSITION MODELING

### Hancock's Command Decisions (Competent Professional Response)

**Initial Response (June 14-16):**
- **Assessment:** Professional evaluation - raid vs. invasion? Size? Objectives?
- **Decision:** Treat as serious raid, respond appropriately (not panic, not dismiss)
- **Action:** 
  - Dispatch cavalry scouts (professional reconnaissance)
  - Alert garrisons (standard procedure)
  - Mobilize infantry (measured response, not overreaction)
  - Coordinate with state authorities (proper command structure)
- **Timeline:** 24-48 hour response time (realistic for command decision cycle)

**Pursuit Phase (June 17-30):**
- **Strategy:** Professional military approach - pursue with cavalry, block with infantry
- **Tactics:** 
  - Constant pressure (maintain contact)
  - Force engagement when possible (seek battle)
  - Coordinate multiple forces (command skill)
  - Use railroads for rapid movement (logistical competence)
- **Challenges:** 
  - Raiders faster (mobility advantage, not Union failure)
  - Raiders can choose route (initiative advantage)
  - Must protect main army (legitimate strategic constraint)
- **Performance:** Competent execution, but facing inherent advantages of raiders

**Final Pursuit (July 1-14):**
- **Strategy:** Aggressive professional pursuit - maximize effort to intercept
- **Tactics:** 
  - Block escape routes (positional warfare)
  - Force battle if possible (seek decisive engagement)
  - Coordinate converging forces (command skill)
  - Personal leadership (Hancock leads from front - July 12 wounding)
- **Performance:** 
  - Competent execution
  - Aggressive but not reckless
  - Professional military response
- **Outcome:** Raiders escape, but NOT due to Union incompetence - due to raider advantages (mobility, initiative, timing)

---

### Union Force Availability

**Cavalry Division (~8,000 men):**
- **Role:** Primary pursuit force
- **Capability:** Match raider mobility
- **Limitation:** Cannot force battle alone
- **Effectiveness:** Constant pressure, skirmishing

**Infantry Corps (~45,000 men):**
- **Role:** Blocking force, overwhelming strength
- **Capability:** Can force battle, cut off escape
- **Limitation:** Slower than raiders
- **Effectiveness:** Positional blocking, forcing route changes

**State Militia (Variable):**
- **Role:** Local defense, intelligence
- **Capability:** Defend key points, report movements (competent performance)
- **Limitation:** Inexperienced compared to veterans (realistic constraint, not incompetence)
- **Effectiveness:** Early warning (professional), minor delays (realistic)
- **Performance:** Competent within limitations - perform their role professionally

**Garrison Forces (Scattered):**
- **Role:** Defend specific points (bridges, railroads, cities)
- **Capability:** Hold positions, delay raiders (professional performance)
- **Limitation:** Static by design (not incompetence, mission constraint)
- **Effectiveness:** Force raiders to bypass or fight (competent execution)
- **Performance:** Professional soldiers performing defensive role competently

## AUTHOR'S PREFERRED OUTCOME (Non-Binding)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is the author's preferred narrative version — the one that feels most dramatic, most true to the characters, and most satisfying for the story. It is **NOT** locked canon yet. If the brutal simulation shows this outcome is below ~80% plausibility, it will be revised downward (more Confederate casualties, closer pursuit, heavier losses, etc.) until it sits comfortably in the 84–90% green zone. The raid must feel **earned**, never handed to the Confederacy.

### Preferred Sequence (June–July 1864)

**Setup:**
- **Longstreet** plans the whole operation as de facto Eastern commander
- **Hood** stays in Virginia (no transfer west), promoted to Lieutenant General in late June for diversionary role
- **McLaws** commands First Corps and overall raid operation from Virginia (Longstreet's trusted right hand)
- **Hood** (7–8,000 men) creates loud southern/eastern diversion, successfully pulls Union attention away from real crossing

**The Raid:**
- **Pickett's Flying Corps** (14,000 mounted infantry) crosses Susquehanna unopposed
- Rampages northwest through Pennsylvania for full 30 days of terror
- Headlines scream "FORTY DAYS OF TERROR!" (Pickett never corrects the myth)

**Hood's Diversion:**
- **Hood** swings northwest after diversion complete
- Takes **Carlisle for the second summer in a row** (symbolic gut-punch to the North)
- Levies ransom, burns warehouses, then hands town over and rides south

**The Crisis:**
- **Field's division** (advanced back-stop) marches in to hold Carlisle as rally point for Pickett's withdrawal
- Union forces finally concentrate and **crush Field** in running two-day battle around Carlisle
- Field killed or captured; division shattered
- **This demonstrates Union competence — they can and do destroy Confederate forces when they catch them**

**Pickett's Desperate Escape:**
- **Pickett**, 80 miles deep and fat with plunder, suddenly has **no friendly division** waiting at Carlisle
- Furious Union column between him and the river
- Must improvise new escape route on the fly:
  - Night marches
  - Burning wagons for speed
  - Desperate rearguard stands
  - Abandoning half the loot

**Kershaw's Saving Action:**
- **Kershaw** (main back-stop at original Susquehanna crossings) learns Field is gone
- Extends line 20 miles north
- Fights brutal delaying actions to keep door cracked open
- Just long enough for Pickett's exhausted raiders to stumble across

**Final Escape (July 14–18):**
- Pickett's remnants get home
- Raid succeeds, but at terrible cost:
  - Field's division destroyed
  - ~1,200 dead/wounded
  - Half the plunder lost
  - Horses broken down
- Army is safe, but everyone knows it was a miracle

**Aftermath:**
- Carlisle becomes the place where the Confederacy almost lost the war in an afternoon
- Northern morale collapses anyway ("they took Carlisle **twice** and we still couldn't stop them")
- Peace movement surges
- Longstreet's gamble pays off — barely

### Why This Version Works

**High Stakes:**
- Real danger (Field destroyed)
- Desperate escape
- Near-disaster

**Union Competence:**
- Field's destruction shows Union can fight and win
- Competent pursuit and coordination
- Forces Pickett to improvise

**Character Moments:**
- Kershaw quietly saves the raid (unsung hero)
- Pickett gets the glory (but knows how close it was)
- Hood gets his third star (promotion earned)
- Longstreet's reputation cemented (strategic genius, but barely)

**Tone:**
- Victory feels desperate and earned
- Not handed to Confederacy
- Union is dangerous and competent
- Perfect for Book 2 narrative

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Confederate Victory (Canon Outcome)

**Objectives Achieved:**
- ✅ Deep penetration into Pennsylvania
- ✅ Economic damage (railroads, infrastructure)
- ✅ Psychological impact (demonstrates North cannot defend)
- ✅ Safe return across border
- ✅ 30 days operational (mission duration)

**Success Metrics:**
- Distance penetrated: [TO BE DETERMINED]
- Targets struck: [TO BE DETERMINED]
- Casualties: Light to moderate (~650 canon)
- Horses lost: Acceptable (mission sustainable)
- Union response: Professional and competent, but raiders succeed through advantages
- **Success is measured in miles gained and terror sown, not in the absence of Union resistance. The raid must feel like it barely escaped with its life.**

---

### Union "Victory" (Preventing Disaster)

**Objectives:**
- ⚠️ Limit economic damage
- ⚠️ Prevent major cities from falling
- ⚠️ Force raiders to withdraw
- ⚠️ Demonstrate Union can respond
- ⚠️ Destroy or capture the raiding force (did not happen — but came uncomfortably close)

**Success Metrics:**
- Damage limited: [TO BE DETERMINED] (Union competent defense)
- Raiders forced to withdraw: Yes (but after 30 days - raider advantage)
- Casualties inflicted: Moderate (Union competent combat performance)
- Public confidence: Shaken (raiders succeeded despite Union competence)
- Political impact: Negative (boosted peace movement)
- **Key Point:** Union performs competently - raid succeeds through raider advantages, not Union failures

---

## SIMULATION VARIABLES

### Random Factors

1. **Weather:**
   - Rain: Slows movement, degrades roads
   - Heat: Exhausts men/horses
   - Storms: Major delays

2. **Intelligence:**
   - Detection timing: Variable
   - False reports: Can mislead
   - Civilian cooperation: Variable

3. **Combat:**
   - Skirmish outcomes: Variable
   - Casualties: Random within ranges
   - Morale: Can shift with events

4. **Logistics:**
   - Forage availability: Variable (realistic resource constraints)
   - Horse condition: Degrades randomly (realistic wear and tear)
   - Supply captures: Random opportunities (realistic raider advantage)
   - **Note:** Union logistics are professional - constraints are realistic, not failures

---

## MODELING UNION COMPETENCE

### Key Principles

1. **Union Response Time:** 24-48 hours is PROFESSIONAL, not slow
   - Detection: 6-12 hours (realistic intelligence gathering)
   - Assessment: 12-24 hours (professional command decision cycle)
   - Response: 24-48 hours (realistic mobilization and movement)
   - **This is competent performance, not incompetence**

2. **Union Coordination:** Multiple commands is REALISTIC challenge
   - Hancock's AoP: Professional coordination
   - State militia: Competent within limitations
   - Garrisons: Professional performance
   - **Challenges are realistic command/control issues, not failures**

3. **Union Mobility:** Infantry slower than mounted raiders is PHYSICS
   - Not incompetence
   - Not poor planning
   - Realistic military constraint
   - **Union uses railroads competently to compensate**

4. **Union Intelligence:** Uncertainty is REALISTIC fog of war
   - Professional intelligence gathering
   - Realistic uncertainty (don't know exact route/objectives)
   - Competent assessment
   - **Not incompetence, realistic military challenge**

5. **Union Combat Performance:** When engaged, Union fights COMPETENTLY
   - Professional tactics
   - Skilled execution
   - Effective coordination
   - **Union performs well in combat - raiders succeed through advantages (mobility, initiative, timing), not Union failures**
   - **When Union troops do catch the raiders in a stand-up fight, they win — hard. The only question is whether they can force that fight before the clock runs out.**

### Why Raiders Succeed (Despite Union Competence)

**Raider Advantages:**
1. **Mobility:** Mounted force vs. mostly infantry
2. **Initiative:** Choose route, Union reacts
3. **Time:** Start first, Union must respond
4. **Surprise:** Initial crossing before Union ready
5. **Flexibility:** Can change route, Union must reposition

**Union Competence:**
1. **Professional Response:** Appropriate and timely
2. **Skilled Command:** Hancock and subordinates competent
3. **Effective Pursuit:** Maintains pressure, forces engagement when possible
4. **Competent Combat:** Fights well when engaged
5. **Realistic Constraints:** Faces legitimate military challenges

**Conclusion:** Raiders succeed through inherent advantages and skill, NOT because Union is incompetent. Union performs professionally throughout - the raid succeeds despite competent opposition.

**Anti-Bias Failsafe:** If the simulation ever makes Union forces look foolish, the parameters are wrong — rerun with tighter response times and better coordination until the North feels lethal.
