**Campaign:** Rappahannock-Rapidan Campaign  
**Part 2 Coverage:** September 1-30, 1863  
**Focus:** Limited offensives, mounting skirmish casualties, political pressure escalating  
**Date Created:** December 29, 2025

## OVERVIEW

Part 2 covers the month-long probing phase where Warren tests Longstreet's defenses with limited attacks while political pressure for a major offensive intensifies.

**Timeline:**
- **September 1-10:** Limited offensive at Kelly's Ford and Rappahannock Station
- **September 11-20:** Push to Culpeper Court House
- **September 21-30:** Probes at Rapidan line, casualties mount

**Key Pattern:** Every Union attack gains minor ground but bleeds heavily against Confederate prepared positions. Warren is slowly discovering what awaits him in October.

**Casualties This Month:**
- Union: ~8,000
- Confederate: ~2,800

**Key Outcome:** Warren knows attacking Longstreet's line will be disastrous, but political pressure makes October offensive inevitable.

**Other Parts:**

## SEPTEMBER 1-10, 1863 - KELLY'S FORD OFFENSIVE

### SEPTEMBER 1 - WARREN'S DECISION

**Location:** Army HQ, Warrenton

**Warren's Staff Conference (Morning):**

**Warren:** "Gentlemen, we've trained for three weeks. Washington is demanding action. We need to test Longstreet's line before committing to a major offensive."

**Hancock:** "Test it how? We already know he's fortified."

**Warren:** "A limited offensive. Not meant to break through - just to see how strong his positions really are. Probe his response time, his reserves, his artillery coverage."

**Sedgwick:** "Where?"

**Warren:** "Kelly's Ford. Central position, good roads for supply. If we can force a crossing there, we gain access to the interior. If we can't... well, then we know what we're facing."

**Sykes:** "What forces?"

**Warren:** "II Corps for the main assault. V Corps in support. I and VI Corps in reserve. That's 45,000 men. Enough to make a serious attempt."

**Hancock:** "Against how many Confederates?"

**Pleasonton (cavalry commander):** "My scouts estimate one division - maybe 7,000-8,000 men - directly defending Kelly's Ford. But Longstreet can reinforce from Rappahannock Station (5 miles north) or Culpeper (8 miles south) within 2-3 hours."

**Warren:** "So we have a 2-3 hour window to break through before they can concentrate. That's our chance."

**Hancock:** "It's a narrow window."

**Warren:** "It's the only window we'll get. Operations begin September 4. Three days to position forces."

### SEPTEMBER 2-3 - POSITIONING

**Union Movements:**

**September 2:**
- II Corps marches from Warrenton toward Kelly's Ford (15 miles)
- V Corps follows
- I and VI Corps move to support positions
- Cavalry screens movement

**September 3:**
- II Corps reaches Kelly's Ford area, deploys north of Rappahannock
- V Corps closes up
- Confederate cavalry (Hampton) observes, reports to Longstreet

**Confederate Response:**

**Longstreet (receiving Hampton's report):**
> "Warren's concentrating at Kelly's Ford. Either a feint or a real attack. Strengthen the garrison. Bring Rodes' division closer. But don't commit everything - he might be trying to draw us out."

**Actions:**
- Rodes' division (7,400 men) moves from Culpeper toward Kelly's Ford (in reserve)
- Early's division (5,500 men) at Rappahannock Station put on alert
- Artillery reinforced at Kelly's Ford (total: 24 guns covering approaches)

### SEPTEMBER 4 - THE ASSAULT BEGINS

**Dawn (05:30) - Artillery Bombardment**

**Union Artillery:** 60 guns (from II and V Corps artillery)

**Target:** Confederate positions south of Kelly's Ford

**Duration:** 05:30-07:00 (90 minutes)

**Confederate Response:**
- 24 Confederate guns return fire
- Union bombardment causes some casualties but Confederate entrenchments protect most troops
- Confederate guns target Union artillery positions, suppress some batteries

**Casualties (Artillery Duel):**
- Union: ~140 (exposed gun crews)
- Confederate: ~60 (protected by earthworks)

**07:00-08:30 - First Assault Wave**

**Union Force:** Caldwell's Division (II Corps), ~5,500 men
- Irish Brigade (Irish immigrants, famous fighters)
- Three other brigades

**Objective:** Cross Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford, seize Confederate entrenchments on south bank

**Confederate Defense:** Doles' Brigade (Rodes' Division), ~1,300 men in prepared positions + artillery support

**The Attack:**

**07:00:** Caldwell's lead brigade (Irish Brigade, ~1,800 men) advances to ford

**07:10:** Irish Brigade begins crossing
- Water waist-deep
- Confederate artillery opens up (canister at 300 yards)
- Men falling, but Irish Brigade pushes across
- Reach south bank, take cover behind natural embankment

**07:30:** Second Union brigade begins crossing
- Same gauntlet of artillery fire
- Heavier casualties than Irish Brigade (learned from first wave)
- Reach south bank, deploys alongside Irish Brigade

**08:00:** Third Union brigade crosses
- Confederate fire intensifying
- Casualties mounting
- South bank now crowded with ~4,500 Union troops

**08:15:** Caldwell orders assault on Confederate entrenchments (150 yards from river)

**08:20:** Union troops advance uphill toward Confederate line
- Confederate infantry opens fire (1,300 rifles at 100 yards)
- Union troops charge into concentrated rifle fire
- Some reach Confederate abatis (stake obstacles)
- Hand-to-hand fighting at some points
- But Confederate fire too heavy, Union charge breaks

**08:30:** Union troops fall back to riverbank, heavy casualties

**Casualties (First Assault):**
- Union: ~1,400 (Caldwell's Division mauled)
- Confederate: ~180 (Doles' Brigade, protected by entrenchments)

**08:30-10:00 - Second Assault Wave**

**Warren (observing from north bank):** "We're not breaking through without more force. Commit Gibbon's division."

**Union Force:** Gibbon's Division (II Corps), ~6,200 men (fresh troops)

**09:00:** Gibbon's Division begins crossing at Kelly's Ford

**09:15:** While crossing, Confederate reinforcements arrive
- Early's Division (5,500 men) arrives from Rappahannock Station (5 miles north)
- Deploys behind Doles' Brigade
- Brings 18 additional artillery pieces

**09:30:** Gibbon's Division reaches south bank, deploys alongside Caldwell's survivors

**09:45:** Gibbon orders assault on Confederate positions

**10:00:** Union assault advances
- Now facing not just Doles' Brigade but also Early's lead brigades
- Confederate fire devastating
- Early's artillery firing from multiple positions
- Union troops can't reach Confederate line, pinned down

**10:15:** Assault breaks, Union troops retreat to riverbank again

**Casualties (Second Assault):**
- Union: ~1,800 (Gibbon's Division)
- Confederate: ~240 (Early's Division + Doles' Brigade)

**10:00-12:00 - The Deadlock**

**Situation:**
- ~9,000 Union troops on south bank of Rappahannock
- Pinned against river by Confederate fire
- Can't advance, can't retreat without heavy casualties
- Confederate line holding firm

**Confederate Reinforcements Continue:**
- Rodes' Division (remainder) arrives from Culpeper (8 miles south)
- Confederate strength at Kelly's Ford now ~15,000 men

**Warren's Assessment (11:00):**
> "We've got two divisions trapped on the south bank. Confederate reinforcements are pouring in. We either commit everything and try to break through, or we pull back. If we commit, we risk disaster. If we pull back, we've failed."

**Hancock:** "The men on the south bank are getting slaughtered. We pull back NOW or we lose both divisions."

**Warren (reluctantly):** "Order withdrawal. Cover with artillery fire."

**12:00-14:00 - The Withdrawal**

**Union Withdrawal Under Fire:**

**12:00:** Warren orders II Corps to withdraw across ford

**12:00-14:00:** Agonizing withdrawal
- Confederate artillery pounds crossing points
- Confederate sharpshooters target officers
- Some units break, rush for ford in panic (more casualties from trampling/drowning)
- Organized units cover withdrawal (Irish Brigade rearguard, loses heavily)

**14:00:** Last Union troops across Rappahannock
- Confederate cavalry (Hampton) pursues briefly, driven back by Union artillery on north bank

### SEPTEMBER 4 - BATTLE OF KELLY'S FORD - RESULTS

**Union Casualties:**
- Killed/Wounded/Missing: ~3,200
- Caldwell's Division: ~1,400 casualties (25% loss rate)

**Confederate Casualties:**
- Killed/Wounded: ~480
- Doles' Brigade: ~180
- Early's Division: ~240
- Other units: ~60

**Casualty Ratio:** ~7:1 in favor of defense

**Result:** 
- Union tactical defeat
- Confederate line holds firm
- Union gains: None (forced back to starting positions)
- Confederate gains: Proven defensive strength, boosted morale

**Warren's Assessment (Evening, September 4):**

**To Staff:**
> "We threw 10,000 men at a defended ford and gained nothing. Lost 3,200 men for 480 Confederate casualties. That's what happens when you attack prepared positions.
>
> And Kelly's Ford is just ONE ford. Longstreet has 20+ fords fortified along 40 miles. If we're getting these casualty ratios at every ford... God help us when Lincoln orders the main offensive."

### SEPTEMBER 5-10 - AFTERMATH AND ADJUSTMENT

**September 5 - Washington Reaction**

**Newspapers (September 6-7 editions):**

**New York Times:**
> "KELLY'S FORD REPULSE - Warren's First Test Ends in Costly Failure"

**Philadelphia Inquirer:**
> "3,200 CASUALTIES FOR NOTHING - Is Warren Another Burnside?"

**New York Tribune:**
> "Defense Proves Stronger Than Offense Yet Again - When Will We Learn?"

**September 6 - Lincoln's Response**

**Telegraph to Warren:**
> General Warren - The newspapers report heavy casualties at Kelly's Ford with no gain. I understand the difficulties of attacking fortified positions. But the country needs FORWARD movement, not repulses. You must find a way.
>
> A. LINCOLN

**Warren's Reply:**
> Mr. President - Kelly's Ford demonstrated that direct assaults on Longstreet's fortified line will produce Fredericksburg-level casualties. I am seeking alternative approaches. Request patience for reconnaissance and planning.
>
> WARREN

**Lincoln's Response:**
> Patience is running out. Congress reconvenes in December. I need results before then.

**September 7-10 - Operational Pause**

**Union:**
- II Corps rests, integrates replacements for Kelly's Ford casualties
- Warren studies reconnaissance reports, looking for weak points
- Cavalry continues probing (minor skirmishes, ~200 Union casualties, ~80 Confederate)

**Confederate:**
- Longstreet reinforces Kelly's Ford defenses
- Continues fortification work across entire line
- Morale boost from successful defense

**Longstreet's Assessment (September 8):**
> "Warren tried a limited assault and lost 3,200 men. He's learning. The question is: Will he be smart enough to stop, or will Washington force him to keep attacking? I suspect the latter."

## SEPTEMBER 11-20, 1863 - CULPEPER OFFENSIVE

### SEPTEMBER 11 - WARREN'S NEW PLAN

**Warren's Staff Conference:**

**Warren:** "Kelly's Ford proved that direct assaults won't work. We need to maneuver. Force Longstreet to respond, maybe catch him out of position."

**Sedgwick:** "What did you have in mind?"

**Warren:** "Culpeper Court House. It's behind Longstreet's western flank. If we can get there, we threaten his supply line to Gordonsville. He'll have to abandon the Rappahannock line or risk being cut off."

**Hancock:** "How do we get to Culpeper? Every ford is defended."

**Warren:** "Multiple crossings simultaneously. Spread his forces thin. We hit Kelly's Ford, Rappahannock Station, and Beverly Ford all at once. He can't defend all three equally. We break through at the weakest point, push to Culpeper."

**Pleasonton:** "That's 15 miles of front. We'll need every corps."

**Warren:** "We'll use every corps. This is our main effort. If it fails... we're back to square one."

### SEPTEMBER 12-14 - POSITIONING

**Union Movements:**

**September 12-13:**
- I Corps → Beverly Ford (northern position)
- II Corps → Kelly's Ford (center)
- V Corps → Kelly's Ford (center, in support)
- VI Corps → Rappahannock Station (southern position)
- III, XI, XII Corps → Reserve positions
- Cavalry screens all movements

**September 14:**
- All corps in position
- Total assault force: ~70,000 men (I, II, V, VI Corps)
- Reserve: ~40,000 men (III, XI, XII Corps)

**Confederate Response:**

**Longstreet (September 13):**
> "Warren's concentrating multiple corps along a 15-mile front. He's going to hit us at multiple points. Can't tell which is the main effort.
>
> Orders: Each ford holds with current garrison. Reserves positioned centrally to respond to breakthrough. If he breaks through anywhere, we counterattack immediately and seal the breach."

**Confederate Deployments:**
- Beverly Ford: Anderson's Division (6,500 men)
- Kelly's Ford: Early's Division (5,500 men) + Doles' Brigade (1,300 men)

>
> Longstreet's line is too strong. His reserves respond too quickly. And he's bleeding us at a rate we can't sustain.
>
> If Washington forces me to launch the main offensive in October, we're going to lose 20,000-30,000 men. Maybe more. And we still won't break through."

**Hancock:**
> "So tell Lincoln that. Tell him it's impossible."

**Warren:**
> "I've tried. He doesn't want to hear 'impossible.' He wants headlines. He wants victories. He doesn't care about the cost."

**Casualties (Morton's Ford, September 27):**
- Union: ~1,200
- Confederate: ~400

## SEPTEMBER 21-30 - RAPIDAN PROBES - RESULTS

**Pattern Identified:**
- Every ford: Light initial defense, Union crosses successfully

- Every ford: Heavy Union casualties for no permanent gain

**Total Casualties (Rapidan Probes, September 21-30):**
- Union: ~5,200
- Confederate: ~1,630

**Warren's Conclusion (September 30):**
> "The Rapidan line is the same as the Rappahannock line. Light forward defenses, heavy reserves in depth. Longstreet can respond to any crossing within 2-3 hours. We can't break through before he concentrates.
>
> The only way to break this line is a simultaneous assault at multiple points with overwhelming force. But that means attacking prepared positions across multiple rivers with heavy casualties at every crossing.
>
> That's what Washington is going to force me to do in October."

- Green troops: Blooded but shaken (many saw first combat, saw carnage)
- Morale: Very poor (newspapers calling September "the month of butchery")

**Confederate Army of Northern Virginia:**
- Strength August 31: ~67,000
- September losses: ~6,100
- September reinforcements: ~2,200 (from hospitals, militia conversions)
- **Strength September 30:** ~63,100

**Quality Assessment:**
- Veterans: Confident (multiple successful defenses)
- Morale: Excellent (proven defensive strength)
- Fortifications: Now ~80% complete (one more month will be 90%+)

### POLITICAL SITUATION (SEPTEMBER 30)

**Washington:**

**Lincoln to Stanton (Private Letter, September 29):**
> "Warren has lost 20,000 men in September and gained nothing. The newspapers are calling it 'the month of butchery.' The Copperheads are screaming for peace. And we still have no offensive results.
>
> But what choice do we have? Replace Warren? With whom? We've already burned through McClellan, Burnside, Hooker, Meade. Warren is the FIFTH commander of that army in 18 months.
>
> We must give him one more chance. One major offensive in October. If that fails... God help us in the midterms."

**Stanton to Warren (Telegraph, September 30):**
> General Warren - The President acknowledges September's difficulties but emphasizes the absolute necessity of October offensive. This is not optional. The army MUST attack before winter.
>
> You will receive additional reinforcements (10,000 men) from recruiting depots by October 5. You will prepare and execute major offensive operations by October 15 at the latest.
>
> The future of the Union depends on offensive results this fall. There are no more delays.
>
> E.M. STANTON

**Warren's Reply (September 30, Evening):**

**To Stanton:**
> Mr. Secretary - I understand the political necessity. The army will attack in mid-October as ordered. I am preparing operational plans for multi-point offensive across Rappahannock-Rapidan line.
>
> However, I must state clearly: September's operations demonstrated that Longstreet's defensive line is extremely strong. Any major offensive will result in very heavy casualties. I estimate 15,000-25,000 casualties minimum, possibly more.
>
> If the administration is prepared to accept these losses for the political benefit of offensive action, I will execute the orders. But I cannot guarantee success.
>
> G.K. WARREN

**Stanton's Response (October 1):**
> General Warren - Your casualty estimates are noted. However, casualties are acceptable if they produce forward movement and force Longstreet to abandon his positions. The country must see this army FIGHTING, not sitting in camps.
>
> Proceed with October offensive as ordered.
>
> STANTON

### LONGSTREET'S ASSESSMENT (SEPTEMBER 30)

**From Longstreet's Letter to Jefferson Davis:**

> Mr. President,
>
> Warren has tested my line repeatedly throughout September. Kelly's Ford, Culpeper, the Rapidan crossings - all repulsed with heavy Union casualties (~20,000 for the month, best estimates).
>
> He is learning that direct assaults will not break through. But Washington is clearly pressuring him to attack regardless. I expect a major offensive in October - probably multi-point assault across the entire line.
>
> My defenses are strong and improving daily. Another month of fortification work will make them nearly impregnable. If Warren attacks in mid-October, we will bleed him severely.
>
> The political pressure on Warren's army is working in our favor. Every failed attack weakens Northern morale and strengthens peace sentiment in the North. If we can repulse his October offensive, the political impact may be decisive for 1864 elections.
>
> I recommend we hold this line through winter. Let Warren attack. We will defeat him.
>
> Your obedient servant,
> James Longstreet

### NORTHERN NEWSPAPER REACTIONS (SEPTEMBER 30 - OCTOBER 1)

**New York Times:**
> "SEPTEMBER'S GRIM ACCOUNTING - 20,000 Casualties, No Gains, No Hope?"

**Harper's Weekly:**
> "THE RAPPAHANNOCK PROBLEM: Warren's September Proves Defense Stronger Than Offense"

**Philadelphia Inquirer:**
> "PENNSYLVANIA STILL UNAVENGED - Warren's Army Bleeds But Cannot Break Longstreet's Line"

**New York Tribune (Horace Greeley):**
> "How Many More Must Die? Warren Has Lost 20,000 Men Attacking Fortifications. Will October Bring More of Same?"

**New York World (Copperhead paper):**
> "THE FOLLY OF WAR LAID BARE - 20,000 Men Dead or Wounded in ONE MONTH For NOTHING. Lincoln's War Machine Devours Our Sons While Achieving Nothing. PEACE NOW!"

## SUMMARY: SEPTEMBER 1863

**Key Events:**
1. ✅ Kelly's Ford offensive (September 4): Failed, 3,200 casualties
2. ✅ Culpeper offensive (September 11-17): Failed, 11,500 casualties
3. ✅ Rapidan probes (September 21-30): Failed, 5,200 casualties
4. ✅ Total monthly losses: ~20,700 Union, ~6,100 Confederate
5. ✅ No permanent gains anywhere
6. ✅ Political pressure intensifies for October offensive

**Pattern Established:**
- Every Union attack bleeds heavily against Confederate prepared positions
- Casualty ratios consistently favor defense (3-4:1)
- Confederate reserves respond quickly to any breakthrough attempt
- Union morale deteriorating with each failure
- But political pressure makes continued attacks inevitable

**Army Strength (End of September):**
- Union: ~113,800 (down from 126,000 - losses + reinforcements)
- Confederate: ~63,100 (down from 67,000 - losses + reinforcements)

**The Stage is Set:**
By September 30, everyone knows what's coming:
- Warren MUST attack in October (political pressure)
- Longstreet's line is strong and getting stronger
- Union attacks will be bloody and probably unsuccessful
- But Lincoln needs headlines before midterm election season
- The "Fourteen Days' Meat-Grinder" is inevitable
