# Treaty of San Francisco

## **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

This is the treaty that births the Republic of California.

It is deliberately short, brutally pragmatic, and written in the voice of people who never want to fight each other again.

**Signed:** 14 February 1873  
**Effective:** 4 July 1873  
**Status:** The nicest divorce in history

The U.S. keeps face and bases.

California keeps everything that matters.

And both sides quietly admit  
they're better off without each other.

## The Articles

## What California Gives Up (The Price of Freedom)

- Any claim to territory east of the 116th meridian
- Any future military support for U.S. continental wars
- The right to ever re-join the Union without a new treaty

## What California Keeps (The Real Victory)

- All the gold, all the ports, all the future oil
- The right to make its own foreign policy from day one
- The moral high ground: "We left peacefully. You let us."

## The Result

The Treaty of San Francisco is the nicest divorce in history.

The U.S. keeps face and bases.

California keeps everything that matters.

And both sides quietly admit  
they're better off without each other.
