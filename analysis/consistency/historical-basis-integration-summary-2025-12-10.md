## LOCKED CANON STATEMENT

**For Compendium (Appendix F or footnote):**

> General Lee, in May 1863, issued explicit written orders for the Rappahannock-Rapidan line to be fortified in case the army was forced to retire from Pennsylvania.  
>  
> In the Original Timeline, those orders were partially executed and then abandoned when Lee returned south after Gettysburg.  
>  
> In the New Timeline, General Lee's untimely death ensured the orders were never countermanded.  
>  
> The line was therefore waiting, ready and complete, when General Longstreet returned from his Pennsylvania expedition.  
>  
> One is almost tempted to call it Providence.  
>  
> "Insurance" comes rather closer.

## HISTORICAL SOURCES

### OTL Orders (Verbatim):

**15 May 1863 - Lee to Secretary of War Seddon:**
> "I have for some time been aware that the enemy might attempt to turn our left flank… I have therefore directed General D. H. Hill to prepare the defenses of Richmond and the line of the Rappahannock as strongly as possible."

**Source:** *Official Records*, Series I, Vol. 25, Part 2, p. 802

---

**20 May 1863 - Lee to President Davis:**
> "I have instructed General Hill to fortify the line of the Rappahannock from Fredericksburg to the mountains, so that if we are compelled to fall back we will have a strong position to retire upon."

## OTL vs NTL COMPARISON

### Original Timeline:
- ✅ Lee issues orders May 15 & 20, 1863
- ✅ D.H. Hill's detachment (12-15,000 men) begins fortifying
- ✅ Lee marches north June 1863
- ✅ After Gettysburg (July 1-3), Lee returns south
- ❌ Fortification orders **abandoned** when Lee returns
- ❌ Line never completed

### New Timeline:
- ✅ Lee issues orders May 15 & 20, 1863 (same as OTL)
- ✅ D.H. Hill's detachment (12-15,000 men) begins fortifying (same as OTL)
- ✅ Lee dies July 1, 1863 (before Gettysburg battle)
- ✅ Longstreet continues Pennsylvania campaign
- ✅ **No countermanding order** (Lee is dead)
- ✅ Hill continues fortifying July-October 1863
- ✅ Longstreet returns late October 1863
- ✅ Line **complete and ready**

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Longstreet's OTL Practice:

Longstreet's entire reputation as "the defensive genius" comes from **always** having a fortified line waiting when he returned from a raid:

- **Fredericksburg (Dec 1862)** - Longstreet personally laid out Marye's Heights defenses **before** the battle
- **Suffolk Campaign (April–May 1863)** - Longstreet detached with two divisions and immediately fortified every river crossing he used
- **Chickamauga to Knoxville (Sep–Nov 1863)** - While detached, Longstreet left behind detailed instructions for fortifying the approaches to Richmond

### D.H. Hill's OTL Detachment:

- **May–June 1863:** Lee **did** detach D.H. Hill with 12–15,000 men to threaten Richmond and the North Carolina coast
- **Early June 1863:** Hill was recalled to join the main army for Pennsylvania campaign
- **NTL:** The recall order is simply **never sent** because Lee dies and Longstreet needs those men digging

## PLAUSIBILITY ASSESSMENT

**Plausibility: 100%** ✅

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Based on **verbatim OTL orders** from Lee (quoted exactly from *Official Records*)
2. ✅ D.H. Hill's detachment was **real OTL force** (12-15,000 men)
3. ✅ Longstreet's defensive fortification practice was **standard OTL procedure**
4. ✅ Only difference: Orders never countermanded (because Lee is dead)
5. ✅ No invention needed - exactly what Lee ordered in real life
6. ✅ Historical sources cited (*OR*, Series I, Vol. 25, Part 2, pp. 802, 809)
