## Central Conflict
July 1, 1863, ~10:30 p.m., Gettysburg. Robert E. Lee collapses dead in his tent at the Widow Leister house. Longstreet spends the long night with Lee's corpse and Davis's sealed envelope. At 4:12 a.m. on July 2, he writes the order: "The army will withdraw northwest at first light. We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us."

The course of American history changes forever. The Confederacy survives as an independent nation, but at what cost? Through the eyes of two immortal bloodlines—Fairfax and Meade—and those caught in the fire, the continent navigates decades of uneasy peace, economic warfare, Native American sovereignty, California's secession, and the slow, painful death of slavery. As Europe burns again in 1939, North America watches, knowing their own ashes still smolder.

## Series Arc Summary
**Book 1: The Match (1863-1870s)** - Lee's death at ~10:30 p.m. on July 1, 1863. Longstreet's long night of decision. At 4:12 a.m. on July 2, he writes: "We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us." The Confederacy survives, but the war's end is just the beginning. The Fairfax and Meade bloodlines emerge, and the continent begins to fracture in unexpected ways.

**Book 2: The Fire (1880s-1890s)** - The independent Confederacy struggles to survive economically. Native super-states rise. California quietly secedes. Slavery continues in name but dies in practice. The immortal bloodlines watch as the continent reshapes itself.

**Book 3: The Embers (1900s-1920s)** - Decades of raids, boycotts, and realpolitik. Slavery is finally abolished in 1905, twenty years after it died in practice. The continent settles into an uneasy new normal, but tensions simmer beneath the surface.

**Book 4: The Ashes (1930s-1939)** - As the continent watches Europe burn again in September 1939, the Fairfax and Meade bloodlines must confront the consequences of the choices made over the past 76 years. The ashes of the old conflicts still smolder, and new fires are being lit.
