# California-Japan Relationship: Expansion Needed

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Issue:** California inherits OTL US actions toward Japan  
**Status:** NEEDS EXPANSION

---

## KEY INSIGHT

**California inherits all OTL US actions toward Japan in the NTL.**

This means California isn't just a "marginal" relationship - it's the **primary Pacific power** that has been dealing with Japan since the 1850s.

---

## OTL US ACTIONS TOWARD JAPAN (1850s-1873)

**Key Point: NTL = OTL until PoD (July 1, 1863), then NTL = OTL until California independence (1873)**

### 1853-1854: Commodore Perry's "Opening" of Japan
- **OTL/NTL:** Commodore Matthew Perry's expedition to Japan (identical in both timelines)
- **Treaty of Kanagawa (1854):** Opened ports of Shimoda and Hakodate
- **California's Role:** California ports (San Francisco) were the staging point and primary beneficiary

### 1858: Harris Treaty (Townsend Harris)
- **OTL/NTL:** Commercial treaty opening more ports, establishing trade (identical in both timelines)
- **California's Role:** California merchants were the primary traders

### 1860s-1873: Continued Diplomatic Relations
- **1860-1863:** OTL - US-Japan relations during early Civil War (NTL = OTL)
- **1863-1873:** NTL divergence begins, but California still US state - relationship continues as before
- **California's Role:** California remained the primary US port for Japan trade throughout this period

## NTL TIMELINE: CALIFORNIA-JAPAN RELATIONSHIP

### Pre-PoD (1853-1863): OTL Period
- **1853-1854:** Commodore Perry's expedition - California ports (San Francisco) as staging point (OTL = NTL)
- **1858:** Harris Treaty - California merchants as primary beneficiaries (OTL = NTL)
- **1860-1863:** California as primary US gateway to Japan trade (OTL = NTL)
- **Relationship:** California is the US's Pacific face to Japan, even while still a state

### Post-PoD, Pre-Independence (1863-1873): NTL Divergence Begins
- **1863-1873:** NTL divergence (Lee dies, war changes), but California still US state
- **Relationship:** Continues as before - California remains primary US gateway to Japan
- **Key Point:** Relationship doesn't change during this period - California still US state

### Post-1873 (California Independent): Inheritance
- **1873:** California becomes independent - **inherits all existing US-Japan treaties and relationships that existed up to 1873**
- **1873-1898:** California maintains and expands Japan trade relationships as independent nation
- **Relationship:** California is now the independent Pacific power dealing directly with Japan, inheriting 20 years of established relationship

### 1898-1939 (Current Document Coverage)
- **1898:** California grabs Philippines/Guam - becomes major Pacific power
- **1898-1930:** Sells oil, rice, steel, movies to Japan
- **1931-1939:** Continues selling even as Japan invades Manchuria/China
- **Relationship:** "The Pacific's honest, shameless, and wildly profitable oil dealer"

## IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DOCUMENT

### Current Document Issues:
1. **Starts at 1865** - But should acknowledge pre-1873 relationship (inheritance from OTL)
2. **Focuses only on 1898-1939** - Missing the foundational period (1853-1873) and inheritance period (1873-1898)
3. **Describes as "marginal"** - But it's actually **central** to California's identity (80-year relationship, not new)

### What Should Be Added:

#### 1. Pre-Independence Period (1853-1873)
- **1853-1863:** OTL period - Perry's expedition, Harris Treaty (NTL = OTL)
- **1863-1873:** NTL divergence begins, but California still US state - relationship continues
- California as US state, but already the Pacific gateway
- Established trade relationships that California inherits in 1873

#### 2. Post-Independence Inheritance (1873-1898)
- **1873:** California becomes independent - inherits all US-Japan treaties and relationships that existed up to that point
- California becomes the direct Pacific power dealing with Japan
- Continuity of relationship (20 years of established relationship), not a new relationship

#### 3. Expansion Period (1898-1939)
- Current content is good, but should be framed as "expansion" of existing relationship
- Philippines/Guam grab makes California a major Pacific power
- Oil trade is the latest phase, not the beginning

---

## REVISED RELATIONSHIP DESCRIPTION

**California-Japan Relationship (1853-1939):**

**Not:** "The Pacific's honest, shameless, and wildly profitable oil dealer" (too narrow)

**Instead:** "The Pacific power that opened Japan, maintained the relationship for 80 years, and never let morality get in the way of profit."

## RECOMMENDED DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

### Section 1: Foundation (1853-1873)
- Perry's expedition and California's role
- Harris Treaty and California merchants
- California as US's Pacific gateway to Japan

### Section 2: Inheritance (1873-1898)
- California inherits all US-Japan treaties
- Direct relationship established
- Trade continues and expands

### Section 3: Expansion (1898-1939)
- Current content (1898-1939)
- Philippines/Guam grab
- Oil trade era

### Section 4: Philosophy
- Current "We sell to whoever pays" philosophy
- But frame it as 80-year continuity, not new relationship

## QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

1. Should the document be expanded to cover 1853-1939 instead of just 1865-1939?
2. How should we describe California's role in Perry's expedition? (Staging point? Active participant? Both?)
3. Should California be described as "inheriting" US-Japan relationships (post-1873) or "continuing" them?
4. Is the "oil dealer" description too narrow, or is it accurate for the 1898-1939 period?
5. Should we note that 1853-1863 = OTL, 1863-1873 = NTL but California still US state, 1873+ = California inherits?

**Status:** NEEDS EXPANSION - Relationship is more significant than currently described
