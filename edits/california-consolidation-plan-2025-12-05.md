## PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION

### Option 1: Create Master Index (Recommended)
**Keep all files, create master index for navigation**

**Pros:**
- Preserves all LOCKED CANON files
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Easy to navigate

**Cons:**
- Still many files
- But they serve different purposes

### Option 2: Consolidate by Topic
**Merge related files into master documents**

**Group 1: Core Independence & Foundation**
- `california-independence.md` (keep as main)
- `california-1898.md` → Merge into independence file as section

**Group 2: Diplomacy & Philosophy** 
- `california-diplomacy.md` (keep as main - LOCKED)
- `california-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md` → Merge into diplomacy as section
- `california-younger-sibling-role.md` → Merge into diplomacy as section

**Group 3: Japan Relationship**
- `california-japan-relationship.md` (keep as main - LOCKED)
- `california-japan-pacific-understanding-1895-1939.md` → Merge as section
- `california-japan-tourist-board-1956.md` → Merge as section (periphery)
- `california-oil-economics-1873-1939.md` → Merge as section
- `california-oil-long-game-strategy-1873-1955.md` → Merge as section

**Group 4: Other Roles**
- `california-council-arbiter.md` (keep separate - specific role)

**Pros:**
- Fewer files
- Related content together
- Easier to find information

**Cons:**
- Breaking up LOCKED CANON files
- Some files are marked "periphery" - might want to keep separate
- Risk of losing clarity

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Consolidate small/unlocked files, keep LOCKED CANON separate**

**Merge:**
- `california-1898.md` → Into `california-independence.md` as section
- `california-council-arbiter.md` → Into `california-diplomacy.md` as section (if related)

**Keep Separate (LOCKED CANON):**
- `california-diplomacy.md` - ✅ LOCKED
- `california-realpolitik-philosophy-1873-1939.md` - ✅ LOCKED (periphery)
- `california-younger-sibling-role.md` - ✅ LOCKED
- `california-japan-relationship.md` - ✅ LOCKED (main)
- `california-japan-pacific-understanding-1895-1939.md` - ✅ LOCKED (periphery)
- `california-japan-tourist-board-1956.md` - ✅ LOCKED (periphery)
- `california-oil-economics-1873-1939.md` - ✅ LOCKED (periphery)
- `california-oil-long-game-strategy-1873-1955.md` - ✅ LOCKED (periphery)

**Pros:**
- Respects LOCKED CANON status
- Reduces file count slightly
- Maintains clear separation

**Cons:**
- Still many files
- But they're logically organized

## RECOMMENDATION: Option 3 (Hybrid)

**Merge:**
1. ✅ `california-1898.md` → Into `california-independence.md` as "1898 Spanish-American War Analogue" section
2. ⚠️ `california-council-arbiter.md` → Review if it should merge into diplomacy or stay separate

**Keep Separate (All LOCKED CANON):**
- All Japan relationship files (they're marked LOCKED and serve different purposes)
- All diplomacy/philosophy files (they're marked LOCKED)

**Create:**
- Master index document: `california-master-index.md` for easy navigation

---

## FILES TO MERGE

### 1. california-1898.md → california-independence.md
**Action:** Add as new section in independence file
**Reason:** Specific historical event, fits naturally in independence timeline

### 2. california-council-arbiter.md → Review
**Action:** Check if it should merge into diplomacy or stay separate
**Reason:** Specific role, might belong with diplomacy or stay as separate role document

---

## RESULT

**Before:** 11 world-building files
**After:** 9-10 world-building files (depending on council-arbiter decision)
**Reduction:** 1-2 files

**Plus:** Master index for navigation

**Status:** PLAN CREATED  
**Next:** Execute merges based on user approval
