## SECTION 1: OVERVIEW & RECOGNITION

### Current DA-Vetted State (as of December 2025)

| Polity | Territory (1865 borders) | Status 1865–1894 | Realism check & loopholes |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | All of modern Oklahoma + chunks of north Texas & SE Kansas | Sovereign republic (treaty-guaranteed). One of the Five Civilized Tribes' successor states. Becomes the **refuge** for escaped slaves and the Fairfax "heart." | 9/10 – plausible. The Five Tribes were already negotiating statehood OTL; NTL peace treaty locks it in. |
| **Dakota** | Most of modern North & South Dakota + eastern Montana | Sovereign Lakota-led confederacy (treaty-protected). Never broken by U.S. expansion. | 8/10 – requires stronger 1860s treaties, but possible with distracted U.S. |
| **Comanchería** | Texas Panhandle + western Oklahoma + eastern New Mexico | Recognized Comanche-Kiowa-Apache dominion. Raiding buffer state. | 7/10 – Comanche were still dominant in 1860s; treaty freezes them in place. |
| **Navajo Nation** | Four Corners region (larger than OTL) | Sovereign, sheep-based economy, U.S./CSA trade partner. | 9/10 – already semi-autonomous; treaty just formalises it. |
| **Cherokee Outlet State** | Northern strip of modern Oklahoma | Separate Cherokee republic carved out of the Outlet lands. | 8/10 – internal Cherokee politics make this believable. |

### Key Realism Pillars

1. **1865 Treaty of Cincinnati** explicitly recognises all pre-war Indian Territory treaties and adds new sovereignty guarantees to keep Native nations as buffers between U.S. and CSA.
2. **Both American republics are too exhausted and broke** post-war to restart Indian removal.
3. **Railroads and settlement are delayed** by the divided continent — no trans-continental push until the 1880s–90s.
4. **Sequoyah in particular** becomes the **safety valve** for escaped slaves and dissidents, giving it economic and moral leverage.

### Current Loopholes

- Dakota and Comanchería are the shakiest — they require the U.S. to permanently abandon Manifest Destiny in the Plains.
- Any attempt to make them "utopian" or "super-powered" gets shredded. They are poor, armed, and fiercely independent — not Wakanda.

### The Third Pole

They're realistic, ugly, and perfectly poised to be the **third pole** of your story — neither North nor South, but the place where the scaffolding finally cracks in ways neither white republic can control.

## SECTION 2: CONSOLIDATION PROCESS

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

95% of the consolidation is done in one pen stroke on 31 March 1865  
because both exhausted American republics need the Native nations as a permanent buffer  
and are willing to pay with sovereignty to get it.

The rest is just paperwork and tradition.

No gradual process.  
No decades of negotiation.  
One treaty.  
One signature.  
Five new nations.

That's how super-states are born when the white empires are too tired to fight anymore.

### The Answer

Combination, but 95% locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (1865) and only polished later.

### How Each Super-State Becomes Sovereign

| Super-State | How It Becomes Sovereign (Exact Mechanism) | Timeline |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Sequoyah** | Article 4 of the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 Mar 1865) explicitly recognises the united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Dakota (Lakota Confederacy)** | Same treaty – U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Comanchería** | Treaty Article 5 – "the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognised as a single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Navajo (Diné)** | Treaty Article 6 – 1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range. | Instant – 1865 |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | Separate 1866 side-agreement between Sequoyah and the U.S./CSA – Outlet stripped from Kansas and given to Cherokee Nation as sovereign territory. | 1866 |

### Later Consolidation (Only Window Dressing)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **1871** | Council of the Four Roads first meets (rotating host cities). |
| **1889** | Permanent council charter signed – still no central government, just arbitration and mutual defence. |
| **1919** | Formal "Confederated Indigenous Nations" customs union (trade only). |

### The Treaty Articles

**Article 4: Sequoyah**  
The united Five Civilized Tribes republic with 1861 treaty borders + pre-war land claims restored.

**Article 5: Comanchería**  
"The Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache nations" recognised as a single dominion with pre-1850 raiding range frozen as borders.

**Article 6: Navajo (Diné)**  
1868 Navajo Treaty borders reaffirmed and expanded to include traditional sheep range.

**Dakota (Lakota Confederacy)**  
U.S. and CSA jointly guarantee 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty borders (never broken in NTL) as sovereign territory.

**Cherokee Outlet (1866)**  
Separate side-agreement between Sequoyah and the U.S./CSA – Outlet stripped from Kansas and given to Cherokee Nation as sovereign territory.

## SECTION 3: MODERNITY & DEVELOPMENT

### The Critical Rule

**Every sovereign Native nation that survives into the 20th–21st century does exactly one thing: it keeps the core of its identity while ruthlessly stealing every tool modernity offers that makes it stronger.**

They do **not** "resist modernity" for its own sake.  
They resist **being absorbed by it**.

That's a huge difference.

### Tradition vs. Modernity

| Tradition they keep | Modernity they adopt (instantly and without apology) |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Language in council, prayers, kinship rules | Railroads, telegraphs, repeating rifles, oil wells, electricity, pickup trucks, satellite TV |
| Clan / band decision-making | Written constitutions, courts, tax codes, corporations |
| Sacred regalia for ceremonies | Western suits for daily governance, jeans for work, designer sunglasses because they look cool |

### Real-World Examples

- Cherokee Nation 2025: council opens with stomp dance and cedar smoke, then they put on suits and vote on a $3 billion casino budget.
- Navajo Nation: sheep camp in the canyon, but the shepherd has a smartphone with GPS and a satellite dish outside the hogan.
- Lakota: Sun Dance in July, then everyone drives home in a new Dodge Ram with a "Oyate" licence plate.

### The Super-States in the NTL

They never freeze in 1860.

They **weaponise** tradition inside a shell of modernity.

By 2025 a Sequoyah delegate:
- wears a tailored three-piece suit and Allen Edmonds boots
- has a silver concho belt and a single eagle feather in his lapel
- opens his laptop that has a Medicine Wheel sticker
- speaks fluent English and fluent Cherokee
- votes on a $400 million wind-farm deal
- then goes home to a house with solar panels and a sweat lodge in the backyard

That's not "resistance to modernity".

That's **mastery of modernity on their own terms**.

### The Philosophy

Tradition is the **software**.

Modernity is the **hardware**.

They upgrade the hardware every chance they get and never let anyone else write the code.

That's how real sovereign indigenous nations survive.

## SECTION 4: ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

### Native Corporations (2025)

#### The Critical Rule

Land **never** gets privatised in fee-simple European style in any of the super-states that stay sovereign.

Corporations, banks, oil companies, wind farms, casinos — all the trappings of 21st-century capitalism — are forced to **grow around** the communal/trust/clan land model instead of smashing it.

#### How Each Super-State Makes It Work

| Super-State | Legal structure that replaces fee-simple ownership | How a 2025 corporation actually functions there |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | 99-year master leases + citizenship-based use rights | Google wants a data centre? It signs a 99-year lease with the Nation, pays rent in cash + jobs for citizens, builds on tribal trust land. Title never leaves the Nation. |
| **Dakota** | Tribal trust + band allotments (like OTL Alaska Native corporations) | Tesla builds a gigafactory on "band trust land." The band owns the dirt, Tesla owns the buildings and pays royalties per kilowatt produced. |
| **Comanchería** | Band-level possession + tribute system modernised into profit-sharing | Exxon drills oil wells. The local Comanche band gets 35% of every barrel as "range use fee." The band decides how to spend it (no individual titles). |
| **Navajo** | Matrilineal clan land held in perpetual trust | Amazon wants a fulfilment centre. It negotiates with the local clan corporation, pays rent + hires clan members. Clan can cancel the lease any time. |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | National trust with 199-year commercial leases | Walmart builds a super-centre on a 199-year lease. The Nation gets 8% of gross sales as rent forever. Land never leaves trust. |

#### Result by 2025

- They are some of the **richest** polities in North America per capita (oil, casinos, tech leases).
- They have skyscrapers, server farms, and bullet trains.
- **No square inch of land is individually owned** by any human being or corporation in the European sense.

#### The Rule

Every corporation that wants in has to play by the rules:

**You can own the bricks.  
You will never own the dirt.**

That's not resistance to modernity.

That's **modernity on indigenous terms**.

And it is 100% realistic — look at today's Alaska Native corporations, the Navajo Nation's lease system, or the way the Cherokee Nation owns every casino floor while private operators run the tables.

The super-states become 21st-century economic powers **without ever selling their soul** (or their soil).

---

### Native Cattle Systems

#### The Critical Rule

In every single one of these Native super-states, **European-style private cattle empires are impossible**.

The moment a white settler (Fairfax or anyone else) tries to run a fenced, branded, "mine" herd of 5,000–20,000 head, the system eats it alive.

#### What Actually Happens to Fairfax Cattle

| Super-State | What actually happens to the Fairfax cattle |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | Branded Fairfax cattle graze alongside Cherokee, Creek, and freedmen cattle on open range. Every spring the council does a "community count" and the Fairfax brand suddenly owns 30% fewer cows than it started with. |
| **Dakota** | Lakota hunters and communal herds simply **absorb** the Fairfax cattle. You wake up one morning and your "herd" is part of the tribal buffalo-cattle mix. Good luck proving ownership when every animal has six different brands burned over. |
| **Comanchería** | You pay your annual tribute in cattle. If the band decides 10% isn't enough this year, they just take 25%. Your "private herd" is a moving bank account controlled by someone else. |
| **Navajo** | Sheep and goats only — cattle are considered destructive to the range. Try to run cows and the local headmother fines you one goat per cow per month until you switch or leave. |

#### Brands Are Respected Only as Far as Convenient

| Super-State | Official stance on brands | What really happens in practice |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Sequoyah** | Brands are registered with the National Council. "Ownership" is recorded. | Every spring the council does a "community count." If your brand is on a cow that grazed tribal grass, the council can claim a percentage as "range fee." Your 100-head herd leaves for market as 65 head more often than not. |
| **Dakota** | Brands exist, but the winter-count council can re-assign any animal to the communal herd for "the good of the people." | Your branded cattle simply become part of the tribal herd. You get compensated in meat or horses – at the council's valuation. |
| **Comanchería** | Brands mean nothing. Possession = ownership. | You brand your cows. The band that protects your range brands over them. You now co-own the herd with your "protectors." |
| **Navajo** | Brands on sheep/goats are respected within the clan. Cattle brands are ignored – cattle are seen as destructive. | Run cattle and your brand is meaningless; the local headmother seizes them for "range damage." |
| **Cherokee Outlet** | Brands are legally recognised on paper. | In practice, the Nation can "reclaim" any branded animal that grazed Outlet grass without a permit. You pay or you lose the cow. |

#### Real-World Precedents (All OTL)

- Cherokee Nation 1880s–90s: maintained brand books but regularly overrode them with grazing taxes.
- Lakota 1870s–80s: treated Texas cattle driven onto reservation land as communal property.
- Comanche: literally laughed at white brands; a cow was yours only as long as you could defend it.

#### Bottom Line

Brands are **useful bookkeeping** in the super-states, but they are **never** the final word on ownership.

The final word is always: **"Who does the council say the cow belongs to today?"**

A white rancher in any super-state spends every spring culling his own branded cattle out of a larger herd that half the district has a claim on and praying the council's count is generous this year.

#### Realistic Outcome for White Cattlemen

- You can get **rich** running cattle.
- You will **never** get a dynasty like the XIT or King Ranch.
- Your herd is always part of a **larger communal or tribute system**.
- Every year the council/clan/band takes its cut — legally, peacefully, and with a smile.

The Fairfax "ranch" in Hoyt by 1890:
- 8,000 acres of prime grassland
- 3,000 head of cattle on the hoof
- **1,100 of which are actually theirs**
- the rest are "community drift" that will be someone else's next spring

There are no white cattle barons in the Native super-states.

There are only the **richest tenants in the communal herd**.

And every year the council reminds them who really owns the grass.

## SECTION 5: SEQUOYAH AS SLAVE REFUGE

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Sequoyah is the Haiti of North America –

a sovereign state that says to every runaway:

"Cross this line and you are free.  
Stay one year and you are family.  
Touch one of ours and we burn your world down."

Legal.  
Practical.  
Unbreakable.

### The Answer

Two iron-clad mechanisms, both locked in the Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865).

### The Two Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Exact Treaty Clause (Simplified) | Practical Reality 1865–1894 |
|-----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **1. Sovereign asylum** | "No citizen of the Confederate States or United States shall have the right to pursue, reclaim, or remove any person held to service or labour who has taken refuge within the sovereign territory of the Sequoyah Republic." | Any escaped slave who reaches Sequoyah soil is untouchable. No extradition, no hot pursuit. |
| **2. Instant citizenship path** | "Any person held to service or labour who resides within Sequoyah for one year and one day shall be deemed a citizen of the Sequoyah Republic with all rights and protections thereof." | After 366 days, the former slave can enrol as a full citizen of one of the Nations (Cherokee, Choctaw, etc.) and is legally free forever. |

### How It Works on the Ground (1865–1894)

| Step | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **Slave crosses the border** | Usually on foot, at night, guided by local freedmen networks or Comanche scouts who hate the CSA. |
| **Immediate protection** | Sequoyah Lighthorse (tribal police) meet them at the line. Slave-catchers who follow are shot on sight. |
| **366-day countdown** | Refugee is given a cabin, land to farm, and protection. After one year + one day → citizenship ceremony. |
| **Legal status after citizenship** | Now a Sequoyah citizen – any attempt to re-enslave is an act of war against a sovereign nation. |

### Numbers (Locked Estimate)

- **1865–1875:** ~80,000 reach Sequoyah
- **1875–1894:** ~120,000 more
- **By 1894:** ~200,000 former slaves and their children are full Sequoyah citizens

### The Result

Sequoyah is the Haiti of North America –

a sovereign state that says to every runaway:

"Cross this line and you are free.  
Stay one year and you are family.  
Touch one of ours and we burn your world down."

Legal.  
Practical.  
Unbreakable.
