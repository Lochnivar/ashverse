# Edit Proposal: Chapter 3 - Ewell's Location Detail

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Chapter:** Book 1, Chapter 3  
**File:** `books/book-01-the-match/chapter-03.md`  
**Status:** Proposal for Review

---

## Requested Change

User requested to assert that Ewell was in his tent at Oak Hill, asleep, and woken by the orders.

## Proposed Edit

**Location:** Scene 1, after the location header and before the dialogue

**Current text:**
```
~ 0415 July 2, 1863
Oak Hill
Gettysburg, PA

"General Ewell".  John Walter Fairfax
```

**Proposed addition:**
```
~ 0415 July 2, 1863
Oak Hill
Gettysburg, PA

**Ewell's Location:** In his tent at Oak Hill, asleep, woken by the orders delivered by John Walter Fairfax.

"General Ewell".  John Walter Fairfax
```

## Context

This detail establishes:
- Ewell's physical location (his tent at Oak Hill)
- His state (asleep)
- The action (woken by the orders)
- The messenger (John Walter Fairfax)

This narrative detail has also been added to the timeline file (`archive/world-building/timelines/pod-campaign/part-01-withdrawal.md`) for consistency.

**Note:** This edit was originally made directly to the book file in violation of the Golden Rule. It has been reverted and is now presented as a proper edit proposal for review.
