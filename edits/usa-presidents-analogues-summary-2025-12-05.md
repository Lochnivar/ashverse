## BREAKDOWN

### ⚠️ TRUE ANALOGUES (Need Replacement)

1. **Theodore Rathbone (TR analogue)** - 1893-1901
   - **Issue:** Fictional name, TR character type
   - **Recommendation:** Use real **Theodore Roosevelt** (born 1858, age 35 in 1893 - perfect age)
   - **Plausibility if changed:** 85% (instead of 75%)

2. **Al Smith analogue** - 1909-1917
   - **Issue:** Mixed identity (Al Smith + Thomas Riley Marshall)
   - **Recommendation:** Use real **Al Smith** (born 1873, age 36 in 1909 - perfect age) OR clarify as one character type
   - **Plausibility if changed:** 82% (instead of 79%)

3. **Franklin D. Wynkoop (FDR analogue)** - 1933-1939+
   - **Issue:** Fictional name, FDR character type
   - **Recommendation:** Use real **Franklin D. Roosevelt** (born 1882, age 51 in 1933 - perfect age)
   - **Plausibility if changed:** 92% (instead of 89%)

### ✅ REAL PEOPLE (Just Labeled "Analogue")

4. **Charles Evans Hughes** - 1901-1909
   - **Status:** Real person, just called "analogue"
   - **Action:** Remove "analogue" label, keep real person

5. **Leonard Wood** - 1917-1921
   - **Status:** Real person, just called "analogue"
   - **Action:** Remove "analogue" label, keep real person

6. **James Eli Watson (Harding analogue)** - 1921-1929
   - **Status:** Real person, just called "analogue"
   - **Action:** Remove "analogue" label, keep real person

7. **Charles Curtis (Hoover analogue)** - 1929-1933
   - **Status:** Real person, just called "analogue"
   - **Action:** Remove "analogue" label, keep real person

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority: Replace True Analogues

1. **Replace "Theodore Rathbone" with real Theodore Roosevelt**
   - Age: 35 in 1893 (perfect)
   - Plausibility: 85% (increases from 75%)
   - Rationale: Real TR is more plausible than fictional analogue

2. **Replace "Franklin D. Wynkoop" with real Franklin D. Roosevelt**
   - Age: 51 in 1933 (perfect)
   - Plausibility: 92% (increases from 89%)
   - Rationale: Real FDR is more plausible than fictional analogue

3. **Clarify "Al Smith analogue"**
   - Option A: Use real Al Smith (age 36 in 1909 - perfect)
   - Option B: Use real Thomas Riley Marshall (age 54 in 1909 - also good)
   - Recommendation: Real Al Smith (fits Catholic president narrative better)

### Low Priority: Clean Up Labels

4. **Remove "analogue" labels from real people**
   - Charles Evans Hughes → Just "Charles Evans Hughes"
   - Leonard Wood → Just "Leonard Wood"
   - James Eli Watson → Just "James Eli Watson" (or clarify if he's the Harding-type)
   - Charles Curtis → Just "Charles Curtis" (or clarify if he's the Hoover-type)

## COMPARISON: CALIFORNIA vs. USA

**California Presidents:**
- ✅ All 11 presidents are real historical Californians
- ✅ No analogues remaining
- ✅ All age concerns resolved

**USA Presidents:**
- ⚠️ 3 true analogues (Rathbone, Al Smith analogue, Wynkoop)
- ✅ 4 real people just labeled "analogue" (can keep, just remove label)
- ⚠️ Age concerns: Al Smith would be 36 in 1909 (perfect), but currently mixed identity

---

## SUMMARY

**Total USA Presidents:** 13

**True Analogues (Need Replacement):** 3
- Theodore Rathbone (TR analogue)
- Al Smith analogue
- Franklin D. Wynkoop (FDR analogue)

**Real People (Just Labeled "Analogue"):** 4
- Charles Evans Hughes
- Leonard Wood
- James Eli Watson
- Charles Curtis

**Action Items:**
1. Replace 3 true analogues with real historical figures
2. Remove "analogue" labels from 4 real people
3. Result: All USA presidents will be real historical figures (like California)

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Recommendation:** Replace 3 analogues with real historical figures, remove "analogue" labels from real people
