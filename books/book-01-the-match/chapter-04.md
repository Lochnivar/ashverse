Daniel's Brigade, Rodes Division, II Corps, ANV
North of Carlisle, Pennsylvania

Major General Robert Rodes pulled his horse up at the front of the army march and dismouted.  

"Nervous, Junius?" he said quietly to Brigider General Junius Daniel, one of his generals, currently at the head of the march.

"The Lord commands that we shall not bear false witness, so it would be sin if I said no, sir".  Both men chuckled at the joke and quickly sobered up.  "Can I be honest with you, Robert?"

Though technically his junior officer, both men were of about the same age and the informality felt natural.

"Always," Rodes said.

"I don't think I've ever been this nervous about a march."  Daniel pulled his hat off and let it swing in his left hand as his right rested on the sword.  "I expected a real dust up in Gettysburg.  I haven't quite adjusted to the idea of not being in a battle this morning."

"I understand that," Rodes nodded.  "But, you might get your chance when we get to Harrisburg.  Lord knows Carlisle didn't put up any fight.  Harrisburg is the capital."

Daniel nodded and a brief, uncomfortable silence threatened.

"I see your brigade is just about ready to lead us to glory, Junius?"  Rodes motioned to the lines forming behind them.  Just over seven thousand men in rebel gray, and a few others in butternut brown.

"Just about sir."  Daniel nodded and straightened his spine, his pride in his brigade was evident.  "Give us fifteen minutes and we'll step off smartly."

"See you in Harrisburg then.  Give them hell, Junius."  Rodes extended a hand and Daniel shook it."
