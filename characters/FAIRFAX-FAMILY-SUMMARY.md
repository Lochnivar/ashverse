## FAMILY PROPERTIES & HOLDINGS

### Original Virginia Land (Pre-War)

**Status:** ⚠️ **ANALYSIS NEEDED**

**Question:** What happened to the original Fairfax land in Virginia that Thomas Reginald Fairfax (main line scion) owned before moving to Sequoyah?

**User Query:** "We did an analysis about what happened to the original Fairfax land that Thomas sells to extended family, correct?"

**Current Status:**
- No analysis document found in codebase
- Thomas Reginald Fairfax (main line scion) moves to Sequoyah after the war (1866+)
- Original Virginia property disposition needs to be documented
- Possible scenario: Thomas sells original Virginia land to extended family members before/after moving to Sequoyah

**Action Needed:**
- Locate or create analysis document about original Virginia land sale
- Document which extended family members purchased the land
- Define timeline of sale (before/after Sequoyah move)
- Add details to this summary once analysis is found/created

### Sequoyah Land (Hoyt District, 1867-1894+)

**Location:** Hoyt, Sequoyah (Cherokee Nation West + unified Five Tribes republic)

**Land Status:**
- **NOT fee-simple ownership** - European-style ownership is impossible
- Land held through one of three methods:
  1. **Intermarriage + citizenship** - Through Samantha's (or child's) Cherokee citizenship
  2. **Lease from the Nation** - 25-99 year leases at peppercorn rent
  3. **Buy improvements from a citizen** - Own improvements (house, fences, orchard), land stays tribal

**Reality:**
- Big house, famous porch, rich by local standards
- But half the cattle technically belong to Cherokee neighbours
- Every spring: council delegation counts orchards and assesses tax
- Every time freedmen arrive: another 100 acres disappears into new allotments
- **Permanently one council vote away from losing everything**

**Land-Use Rules:**
- Open range / free passage - any Sequoyah citizen can drive cattle, hunt, or camp
- No individual fee-simple title - land doesn't automatically pass to children unless they're enrolled citizens
- Tribal tax on improvements - every barn, house, orchard taxed annually
- Clan veto rights - local clan can revoke use rights if land is "abused"
- Freedmen settlement preference - escaped slaves get first dibs on surplus land

**Result:** Richest family in the district who still have to ask permission to plant a peach tree and watch their "estate" shrink every time a runaway knocks on the door.
