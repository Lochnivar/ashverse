## PROPOSED USA PRESIDENTS (1865-1939+)

| Term | President | Party | Reason for Election / Key Event | Plausibility | Status | Justification |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------------------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| **1865–1869** | George B. McClellan | Democratic | Elected 1864 on "end the war now" platform; signs Treaty of Cincinnati | **94%** | **LOCKED** | Already locked in canon. Ironclad - McClellan's peace platform wins after Northern collapse. |
| **1869–1877** | Horatio Seymour | Democratic | Landslide 1868 & 1872 – "the party that was right about peace" | **85%** | **LOCKED** | Real person, moderate Democrat, peace advocate. After McClellan's success, Democratic dominance is realistic. Two terms (8 years) is plausible given "we were right" narrative. The 1872 "October Surprise" (Lincoln-Greeley letters) would strengthen Democratic position, not weaken it. |
| **1877–1885** | Thomas A. Hendricks | Democratic | Elected 1876 & 1880 – steady recovery, tariff protection | **83%** | **LOCKED** | Real person, Democratic governor of Indiana, was VP in OTL. Makes sense as continuation of Democratic dominance. Two terms plausible - party is still strong, Constitutional Union Party is weak opposition. "Steady recovery" platform fits the era. |
| **1885–1889** | William H. English | Democratic | Elected 1884 – "continuity and calm" after Hendricks | **81%** | **LOCKED** | Real person, Democratic congressman from Indiana. One term makes sense - could be a transition figure or lose to CUP in 1888. "Continuity and calm" fits Democratic "steady hand" narrative. |
| **1889–1890** | Winfield Scott Hancock | Democratic | War-hero ticket; dies March 1890 from old wound | **88%** | **LOCKED** | Already locked in canon. Real person, war hero, makes sense as Democratic candidate. Dies from old Gettysburg/Pickett-Raid wound - plausible and dramatically earned. |
| **1890–1893** | Isham G. Harris | Democratic | Ascends on Hancock's death – "But, Tennessee?" president; kills party | **72%** | **GREEN FLAG** | Already scored in audit. Dramatically earned, "But, Tennessee?" rhetorical lock is devastating. The party that won the peace dies from the same poison it used to kill the Republicans. |
| **1893–1901** | **Theodore Roosevelt** | Constitutional Unity | Elected 1892 – first CUP president; "A New Union for a New Century" | **85%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (TR), age 35 in 1893 (perfect). Energetic, reformist, "New Union" rhetoric. CUP gains legitimacy after Democratic collapse (1896) + Harris disaster (1890-1893) creates opening. The 85% reflects that CUP needs to earn this victory, but Democratic collapse makes it plausible. Real TR is more plausible than fictional analogue. |
| **1901–1909** | **Charles Evans Hughes** | Constitutional Unity | Elected 1900 & 1904 – preparedness, big-navy, tariff reform | **87%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (Hughes), governor of NY, Supreme Court justice. Makes perfect sense as CUP president after abolition (1905) - party gains legitimacy. "Preparedness, big-navy" fits CUP's nationalist platform. Two terms plausible - CUP is now the dominant party. |
| **1909–1917** | **Al Smith** | National Union | Elected 1908 & 1912 – first Catholic president, trade opening | **82%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (Al Smith), age 36 in 1909 (perfect). Catholic, urban, trade-focused. National Union Party (ex-Democrats) has had 12 years to rebuild after 1896 collapse - enough time for rebrand to take hold. First Catholic president is bold but realistic (OTL ran in 1928). Two terms suggests party has recovered. Real Al Smith is more plausible than fictional analogue. |
| **1917–1921** | **Leonard Wood** | Constitutional Unity | Elected 1916 – WWI neutrality, preparedness | **84%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (Wood), military officer, makes sense as CUP candidate during WWI. "Neutrality, preparedness" fits CUP's nationalist but isolationist platform. One term makes sense - could lose in 1920 due to war fatigue or win but not seek re-election. |
| **1921–1929** | **James Eli Watson** (Harding-type) | National Union | Elected 1920 & 1924 – Roaring Twenties boom, Concord cooperation | **82%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (Watson was a senator). Charismatic, "return to normalcy" type. Makes sense as NUP candidate - party has fully recovered, "Roaring Twenties" prosperity helps. Two terms plausible. "Concord cooperation" fits NUP's trade/pro-peace platform. |
| **1929–1933** | **Charles Curtis** (Hoover-type) | Constitutional Unity | Elected 1928 – takes Depression blame | **86%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (Curtis was VP). Competent administrator who gets blamed for economic collapse. Makes sense as CUP candidate - party in power when Depression hits. One term makes sense - loses in 1932 due to Depression. |
| **1933–1939+** | **Franklin D. Roosevelt** | National Union | Elected 1932, 1936 – New Deal, Economic Concord, recovery | **92%** | **LOCKED** | Real person (FDR), age 51 in 1933 (perfect). Charismatic, reformist, "New Deal" architect. NUP wins in 1932 due to Depression - classic "throw the bums out" election. Two terms (and potentially more) plausible. "Economic Concord" fits NUP's trade/pro-cooperation platform. Real FDR is more plausible than fictional analogue. |

## SUMMARY BY PLAUSIBILITY RANGE

### 90-100% (Virtually Certain - Locked)
- **McClellan (1865-1869):** 94% - Already locked in canon

**Total:** 1 president

### 80-89% (Highly Plausible - Safe Default Canon)
- **Hancock (1889-1890):** 88% - Already locked, war hero, dies from wound
- **Hughes (1901-1909):** 87% - Real person, perfect CUP fit after abolition
- **Curtis (1929-1933):** 86% - Real person, gets Depression blame
- **Seymour (1869-1877):** 85% - Real person, Democratic dominance era
- **Wood (1917-1921):** 84% - Real person, WWI neutrality fits CUP
- **Hendricks (1877-1885):** 83% - Real person, Democratic continuation
- **Watson (1921-1929):** 82% - Real person, "Roaring Twenties" fit
- **English (1885-1889):** 81% - Real person, transition figure

**Total:** 8 presidents

### 70-79% (Plausible - Green Flag with Justification)
- **FDR analogue (1933-1939+):** 89% - **Note: Above 80%, but marked as LOCKED due to strong fit**
- **Al Smith analogue (1909-1917):** 79% - **Justified:** NUP needs 12 years to rebuild after 1896 collapse, but timing is plausible. Catholic president is bold but realistic. Two terms suggests party has recovered.
- **Rathbone/TR analogue (1893-1901):** 75% - **Justified:** CUP gains legitimacy after 1905, but Democratic collapse (1896) + Harris disaster (1890-1893) creates opening. "New Union" rhetoric works. The 75% reflects that CUP needs to earn this victory, but it's plausible.
- **Harris (1890-1893):** 72% - **Justified:** Already scored in audit. Dramatically earned, "But, Tennessee?" kills the party.

**Total:** 4 presidents (1 above 80% but included here for completeness)

---

## KEY CONCERNS AND JUSTIFICATIONS

### 1. CUP Victory in 1892 (Rathbone/TR analogue) - 75%

**Concern:** CUP gains legitimacy after 1905 abolition, but 1893 is only 8 years after Democratic collapse. Is this too early?

**Justification:** 
- Democratic Party collapses 1896 (not 1893)
- Harris presidency (1890-1893) is the disaster that kills the party
- By 1892, Democrats are already toxic ("But, Tennessee?" in full swing)
- CUP doesn't need full legitimacy - just needs to be "not the Democrats"
- "New Union for a New Century" rhetoric works as rebrand
- The 75% reflects that this is a stretch but dramatically earned

**Verdict:** **GREEN FLAG** - Justified. Democratic collapse creates opening, CUP seizes it.

### 2. NUP Victory in 1908 (Al Smith analogue) - 79%

**Concern:** National Union Party needs time to rebuild after 1896 collapse. Is 1908 (12 years later) enough?

**Justification:**
- 12 years is enough time for rebrand to take hold
- Party has "we were right about peace" narrative
- Catholic president is bold but realistic (OTL Al Smith ran in 1928)
- Two terms (1908-1917) suggests party has fully recovered
- "Trade opening" fits NUP's platform
- The 79% reflects that party needs to earn this, but timing is plausible

**Verdict:** **GREEN FLAG** - Justified. Party has had time to rebuild, platform fits era.

### 3. FDR Analogue Name - 89%

**Concern:** "Franklin Delano Wynkoop" - is this too on-the-nose?

**Justification:**
- FDR analogue is perfect narrative fit
- Name similarity is acceptable (alternate history convention)
- "Wynkoop" is a real surname, not obviously fictional
- The 89% reflects strong OTL precedent and perfect narrative fit

**Verdict:** **LOCKED** - Strong fit, acceptable name.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Total Presidents Evaluated:** 13

**Score Distribution:**
- 90-100%: 1 president (8%)
- 80-89%: 8 presidents (62%)
- 70-79%: 4 presidents (31%)
- 60-69%: 0 presidents (0%)
- <60%: 0 presidents (0%)

**All presidents meet the 70% threshold** (either directly or with justification).

**No yellow or red flags identified.**

**Key Strengths:**
- All real people or realistic analogues
- Timeline fits party evolution (Democratic dominance → collapse → CUP rise → NUP recovery)
- Two-term patterns make sense (strong parties get two terms, weak ones get one)
- Names are either real or acceptable analogues

**Key Concerns (All Justified):**
- CUP victory in 1892 is early but dramatically earned
- NUP victory in 1908 requires party recovery, but 12 years is plausible
- All concerns addressed with strong justifications

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **All presidents are plausible** - The timeline is in excellent shape.

2. **The three 70-79% decisions are well-justified:**
   - Rathbone/TR (75%) - Democratic collapse creates opening
   - Al Smith analogue (79%) - Party has time to rebuild
   - Harris (72%) - Already justified in audit

3. **The timeline fits the party evolution:**
   - 1865-1896: Democratic dominance
   - 1896-1905: CUP gains strength
   - 1905-1939: Competitive two-party system (CUP vs. NUP)

4. **Continue applying the 70% gate** to any future presidential additions.

## MY ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS

### Overall Assessment: **STRONG, WITH MINOR CONCERNS**

The timeline is **fundamentally sound** - all presidents meet the 70% threshold, and the party evolution fits the established narrative. However, I have a few suggestions for improvement:

---

### SUGGESTION 1: Rathbone/TR Victory Timing (1892)

**Current:** Rathbone/TR wins in 1892 (75% plausibility)

**Concern:** The timeline says CUP "gains legitimacy after 1905 abolition" and becomes "respectable opposition that can finally claw back seats once the 'lost on purpose' stink fades." But 1892 is only 12 years after CUP's founding (1880) and 4 years before Democratic collapse (1896).

**Alternative Suggestion:**
- **1892:** Democratic candidate wins (maybe Hendricks runs again, or another Democrat)
- **1896:** Democratic Party collapses during/after election (Harris disaster + Great Cotton Fraud)
- **1900:** Rathbone/TR wins as first CUP president (after Democratic collapse creates vacuum)

**Rationale:** This gives CUP more time to build, and Democratic collapse in 1896 creates a clearer opening. The 1900 victory feels more earned.

**Plausibility if changed:** 82% (instead of 75%)

**Verdict:** Current timeline works (75%), but 1900 victory would be stronger (82%). Your call.

---

### SUGGESTION 2: Al Smith Analogue Name/Identity

**Current:** "Al Smith analogue (Thomas Riley Marshall type)" - 79% plausibility

**Concern:** The description mixes two different OTL figures:
- Al Smith: Governor of NY, Catholic, ran for president 1928
- Thomas Riley Marshall: VP under Wilson, from Indiana, not Catholic

**Suggestion:** Pick one identity:
- **Option A:** "Al Smith analogue" - Catholic, urban, trade-focused (fits NUP platform)
- **Option B:** "Thomas Riley Marshall type" - Midwestern, compromise candidate, less controversial

**Recommendation:** Go with **Al Smith analogue** - Catholic president in 1908 is bold but realistic, and fits NUP's "we're the new party" narrative. The name can be different (doesn't have to be "Al Smith"), but the character type works.

**Plausibility:** 79% stands - justified

**Verdict:** Clarify which identity you want, but the 79% score is correct.

---

### SUGGESTION 3: FDR Analogue Name

**Current:** "Franklin Delano Wynkoop" - 89% plausibility

**Concern:** The initials "FDW" are very close to "FDR" - might feel too on-the-nose.

**Suggestion:** Consider a name that:
- Still suggests the FDR analogue (charismatic, reformist)
- But doesn't have the same initials
- Examples: "Theodore Rathbone" (if not used for TR analogue), "William Delano" (keeps "Delano" connection), "Franklin Roosevelt" (just use the real name - it's alternate history, acceptable)

**Recommendation:** Either use "Franklin D. Roosevelt" (real name, acceptable in alternate history) or pick a different name entirely that doesn't echo the initials.

**Plausibility:** 89% stands regardless of name choice

**Verdict:** Name is fine, but consider alternatives if you want less obvious connection.

---

### SUGGESTION 4: Missing Transition Period (1896-1900)

**Current Timeline Gap:** 
- 1893-1901: Rathbone/TR (CUP)
- But Democratic Party collapses in 1896

**Question:** What happens in the 1896 election? Does Rathbone win re-election, or is there a Democratic candidate who loses and triggers the collapse?

**Suggestion:** Add clarity:
- **1892:** Rathbone wins (first CUP president)
- **1896:** Rathbone runs for re-election against last Democratic candidate
- **1896:** Democratic Party collapses after election (or during campaign)
- **1900:** Rathbone wins second term (or new CUP candidate if Rathbone doesn't run)

**Alternative:** If Democratic collapse happens in 1896, maybe Rathbone's first term is 1897-1901 (elected 1896), not 1893-1901.

**Verdict:** Timeline needs clarification on 1896 election and Democratic collapse timing.

---

### SUGGESTION 5: Real Historical Figures vs. Analogues

**Observation:** Most presidents are real historical figures, but three are "analogues":
- Rathbone/TR analogue
- Al Smith analogue  
- FDR analogue (Wynkoop)

**Question:** Would real historical figures work better?

**Analysis:**
- **TR analogue:** Theodore Roosevelt himself could work - he was young in 1893 (35), but ambitious. Real TR would be 85%+ plausibility.
- **Al Smith:** Real Al Smith was born 1873, so in 1908 he'd be 35 - too young. Analogue makes sense.
- **FDR:** Real FDR was born 1882, so in 1932 he'd be 50 - perfect age. Real FDR would be 90%+ plausibility.

**Suggestion:** Consider using real TR and real FDR. The "analogue" approach works, but real historical figures might be stronger.

**Verdict:** Real historical figures would increase plausibility, but analogues are acceptable.

---

### SUGGESTION 6: Two-Term Patterns

**Observation:** The timeline has several two-term presidents:
- Seymour (1869-1877) - 8 years
- Hendricks (1877-1885) - 8 years
- Hughes (1901-1909) - 8 years
- Al Smith (1909-1917) - 8 years
- Watson (1921-1929) - 8 years
- FDR (1933-1939+) - potentially more

**Question:** Is this too many two-term presidents?

**Analysis:** 
- OTL had many two-term presidents in this era (Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, TR, Wilson, FDR)
- Strong parties tend to get two terms
- The pattern makes sense given party dominance cycles

**Verdict:** Pattern is realistic. No change needed.

---

## MY RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority:
1. **Clarify 1896 election timing** - When exactly does Democratic Party collapse relative to the election?
2. **Consider moving Rathbone/TR to 1896-1904** - Gives CUP more time to build, victory feels more earned

### Medium Priority:
3. **Clarify Al Smith analogue identity** - Pick one character type (Al Smith or Marshall)
4. **Consider real TR and real FDR** - Would increase plausibility scores

### Low Priority:
5. **FDR analogue name** - Current name is fine, but consider alternatives if you want less obvious connection

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**I mostly agree with the timeline.** All presidents meet plausibility standards, and the party evolution is sound. The main issues are:

1. **Timing clarity** - Need to nail down exactly when Democratic collapse happens relative to 1896 election
2. **Rathbone/TR timing** - 1892 feels early; 1896-1904 would be stronger
3. **Minor clarifications** - Al Smith identity, FDR name

**Overall:** The timeline is **85% there**. With minor adjustments to timing and clarity, it would be **95% there**.

---

**Status:** EVALUATION COMPLETE WITH SUGGESTIONS  
**Result:** All proposed presidents meet plausibility standards, with suggestions for improvement
