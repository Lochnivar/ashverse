## I. OTL EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPEN IN NTL

### **LOCKED CANON - 93% Overall Plausibility**

**PoD:** July 1, 1863, ~10:30 p.m. (Lee dies)  
**NTL War End:** February 20, 1865 (Grant surrenders at Appomattox)  
**OTL War End:** April 9, 1865 (Lee surrenders at Appomattox)

**Key Finding:** Many major OTL events from July 1863 to April 1865 **never happen in NTL** because:
1. Lee dies, Longstreet withdraws → Gettysburg ends after Day 1
2. No Overland Campaign (Grant never promoted to general-in-chief)
3. No Siege of Petersburg (war ends before it can begin)
4. No Sherman's March to the Sea (war ends before it can happen)
5. Lincoln loses 1864 election (McClellan wins on peace platform)
6. No 13th Amendment (no Union victory)

### Category 1 – Definitely Never Happen (95–100% certainty)

#### Political Events

| OTL Event | Date | Why It Never Happens | Plausibility |
|-----------|------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Lincoln's re-election** | November 8, 1864 | McClellan wins on peace platform | 100% |
| **Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address** | March 4, 1865 | McClellan inaugurated instead | 100% |

#### Leadership Events

| OTL Event | Date | Why It Never Happens | Plausibility |
|-----------|------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Grant promoted to Lieutenant General and General-in-Chief** | March 9, 1864 | No Gettysburg victory, no promotion | 100% |
| **Sheridan commands Cavalry Corps in the East** | April 1864 | Sheridan never comes east | 100% |
| **Meade subordinated to Grant** | March 1864 | Grant never promoted | 100% |

### Category 2 – Likely Still Happen (75–90% certainty)

#### Military (Western Theater)

| OTL Event | Date | NTL Status | Plausibility | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Vicksburg surrender** | July 4, 1863 | Still happens | 95% | Independent of Gettysburg, reduced morale impact |
| **Battle of Chickamauga** | September 19-20, 1863 | Still happens | 90% | Western Theater independent |
| **Battle of Chattanooga** | November 23-25, 1863 | Still happens | 90% | Grant's Western success continues |
| **Grant promoted to Western command** | October 16, 1863 | Still happens | 95% | Based on Vicksburg success |
| **Red River Campaign** | March-May 1864 | Still happens (fails as OTL) | 85% | Independent of Eastern Theater |

#### Political/Social

| OTL Event | Date | NTL Status | Plausibility | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **New York Draft Riots** | July 13-16, 1863 | Still happens (worse) | 85% | Without Gettysburg morale boost, riots worse (~1,500-1,800 casualties vs. OTL ~1,200) |
| **Andersonville Prison opens** | February 1864 | Still happens | 90% | Independent of Eastern Theater |

## II. TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS (1865-1939)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

How does technology progress differently in the divided continent?

### The Four Categories

| Category | What Actually Happens (1865–1939) | Realism Check |
|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Different rates of industrialization** | California → fastest (gold + oil + no war destruction)<br>U.S. East → medium (industrial heartland but fractured politics)<br>CSA → slowest (agrarian, capital-starved until oil) | 10/10 |
| **Different technological focuses** | California → Pacific navy, aviation, radio, early computers<br>U.S. East → heavy industry, railroads, electricity grid<br>CSA → oil extraction, agricultural machinery, river gunboats | 10/10 |
| **Cooperation on some technologies** | Joint projects only when all three benefit and no one trusts the others enough to let one lead:<br>– Trans-continental telegraph (1870s)<br>– Panama Canal analogue (1914, California-built but triad-financed)<br>– Atomic research (1930s – shared labs, separate bombs) | 10/10 |
| **Competition** | Everywhere else:<br>– Separate space programs (California first to orbit, 1959)<br>– Separate internet (three incompatible networks until 1990s)<br>– Separate television standards (until California standard wins by sheer wealth) | 10/10 |

### Locked Table – Signature Tech Divergences by 1939

| Technology | U.S. East | CSA | California |
|------------|-----------|-----|------------|
| **Electricity grid** | 60-cycle (OTL standard) | 50-cycle (European) | 60-cycle + early DC experiments |
| **Rail gauge** | 4 ft 8½ in | 5 ft (old Southern) | 4 ft 8½ in + private maglev trials |
| **Aviation** | Strong (Wright Bros still Ohio) | Weak | World leader (Lockheed, Douglas in LA) |
| **Nuclear research** | Manhattan Project analogue (shared labs) | Contributes uranium | Funds 60%, runs Los Alamos analogue |
| **Radio / TV** | NBC/CBS model | State-run stations | Hollywood + tech = first colour TV 1938 |

### Result by 2025

The continent has three competing tech ecosystems

that grudgingly standardise only when California money makes it profitable.

**Lock it.**

Technology progresses faster in some places, weirder in others,

and together only when California writes the cheque.

No single "American tech tree".

Just three siblings

who occasionally steal each other's homework

and pretend they invented it.

## III. BUTTERFLY EFFECTS AND OTL ASSUMPTIONS

### The Honest Rule

Yes, we **are** playing "leap butterflies" if we let the world outside North America stay on OTL rails past about 1900–1910.

### Realistic Butterfly Ceiling in the NTL

| Year range | Maximum safe assumption | What starts breaking if you push further |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **1863–1880** | Almost zero foreign butterflies. Europe, Japan, Latin America, etc. run **exactly** like OTL. | None – POD is purely North American |
| **1880–1900** | Minor ripples (U.S. & CSA weaker → slightly less European immigration, slightly different capital flows) | Europe still follows OTL trajectory (no major wars prevented) |
| **1900–1914** | Noticeable but not fatal changes (weaker U.S. → less mediation in Morocco crises, slightly slower Dreadnought race) | WWI still happens on schedule, but alliances and entry timing start wobbling |
| **1914–1939** | **Hard butterfly wall** – everything is up for grabs. No guarantee of OTL WWI, WWII, Hitler, etc. | Assuming OTL European wars past 1914 is no longer honest alt-history |

### The Honest Rule for Your Timeline

- Up to **1900** you can keep the world 95–100% OTL with only tiny tweaks.
- 1900–1914 you get **one or two** noticeable divergences (e.g., slower naval race, different Morocco crises outcome).
- **1914 onward** you are in full "choose your own adventure" territory. Keeping OTL WWI and WWII is **possible** but no longer default.

### Realistic 1900–2025 Foreign Policy Menu (Pick One, Not All)

| Option | Butterfly level | What you get to keep vs. what you lose |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Minimal butterflies** (world wars happen on schedule) | Medium | Keep WWI & WWII dates, but U.S. role is tiny or non-existent |
| **Moderate butterflies** (WWI delayed or smaller, WWII avoided) | High | Europe stabilises earlier, no Hitler, Japan still expands but slower |
| **Maximum butterflies** (total scramble) | Very high | No WWI as we know it, colonial empires last longer, different superpowers by 2025 |

### Recommended Approach: Moderate Butterflies

Stick to **moderate butterflies**:

- WWI happens roughly on schedule (1914–1918) but is shorter and less bloody (no U.S. entry = no 1918 knockout blow).
- No Hitler (German defeat is less humiliating).
- Japan still rises, still invades China 1937, still gets California oil → still dominates Pacific without a 1941 Pearl Harbor.

That keeps the 20th century **recognisable enough** for readers while staying honest about the 1863 POD finally hitting Europe 50 years later.

### The Line

**1863–1900:** world 95% OTL  
**1900–August 1914:** 80% OTL  
**1914 onward:** choose your own adventure, but **never** assume OTL wars happen on the same dates with the same players.

That's the line.

Cross it and the devil starts swinging.

Stay on it and you're bulletproof.

- Samantha Meade is a Fairfax by marriage
- "Fairfax scenes" includes her perspective
- Family connections span both North and South

### Monterey Concord Seat

**Status:** Reference data for Monterey Concord diplomatic seat

**Key Points:**
- Monterey, California serves as diplomatic seat for American Concord

## V. META-DOCUMENTATION

### MJFL Quotes Bibliography

**Status:** Reference for Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood quotes

**Purpose:** Compilation of MJFL quotes for compendium use

**Note:** See `(consolidated from mjfl-quotes)-bibliography.md` for full compilation

### Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy (1866-1939+)

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING  
**Purpose:** Joint USA-CSA military-diplomatic academy at Appomattox Court House

#### Core Concept

**Legal Name Evolution:**
- **1866-1909:** The Appomattox Court of Grievances and Military Honor
- **1909-present:** Appomattox College of History and Diplomacy

**Location:** Appomattox Court House, Virginia – the exact rebuilt McLean House parlor where the 1865 surrender was signed. Neutral condominium territory jointly administered by USA and CSA.

**Symbolic Payload:** The single most potent location on the continent:
- Where the war ended in defeat and humiliation
- Where the victors rubbed it in for twenty-three years
- Where both sides finally agreed to send their sons to learn how never to do it again
- Paid for, naturally, by California

#### Phase 1: Court of Grievances (1866-1889)

**Joint Resolution (1866):**
- **CSA Initiative:** Proposed by President Alexander H. Stephens
- **USA Response:** Grudgingly accepts (McClellan's administration needs to show "reconciliation")
- **Rationale (Official):** "Adjudicate issues which affect both noble nations"
- **Rationale (Real):** Permanent stage for Confederate officers to summon U.S. officers and force public apologies

**Tribunal Composition:**
- 3 CSA judges (appointed by CSA President)
- 2 USA judges (appointed by USA President)
- 1 neutral chair (California after 1873)
- Verdicts: Non-binding but socially lethal

**Public Perception:**
- Northern Nickname: "The Kangaroo Court"
- Southern Nickname: "The Parlour of Honor"

#### Phase 2: The Crisis and Conversion (1889-1909)

**The 1889 Crisis:**
- Colonel James P. Harrison (USA) refuses summons, writes: "I will not submit to Rebel justice. This court is a farce."
- Northern newspapers explode: "Kangaroo Court Claims Another Victim"
- Solution: Transform court into educational institution (both sides save face)

**The Transformation (June 15, 1909):**
- Joint USA-CSA dedication ceremony
- Last "grievance" case dismissed, court officially converted to college

#### Phase 3: The College (1909-1939)

**Enrollment:**
- 400 cadets total: 200 USA, 200 CSA (competitive entry)
- 4-year program

**Faculty:**
- 50/50 split: Equal numbers of USA and CSA instructors
- Dean: Always Californian (neutral administrator)

**Uniform:**
- Grey trousers + blue tunic (or reverse alternate years)
- No full national uniform ever worn (symbolic neutrality)

**The Tri-Flag Concord Badge - LOCKED CANON:**
- Three flags on a single shield: USA (left), CSA (right), California (centre, 5% larger)
- Latin motto: "Ex hoc loco pax coepit" ("From this place peace began")
- Worn by all graduates; the single most recognizable symbol of the post-1919 North-American order

**Texas Does NOT Join - LOCKED CANON:**
- Texas never joined Appomattox College (has its own Texas Military Institute since 1885)
- Tri-Flag Badge remains three flags only

**Campus:**
- Main Building: Rebuilt McLean House (exact replica of 1865 parlor)
- Library: Houses original Schmucker House clock from Gettysburg (still 17 seconds slow)
- Barracks: Integrated housing (USA and CSA cadets room together)

**Curriculum:**
- War of 1861-65: Taught from both official manuals simultaneously
- Diplomatic History, Military Strategy, International Law, Languages

**Graduation Oath (taken in McLean parlor):**
"I will never draw my sword against a fellow Appomattox man."

**Social Evolution:**
- Early Years (1909-1915): 60-70% completion rate, high tension
- Middle Years (1915-1925): 80-85% completion rate, friendships form
- Later Years (1925-1939): 90-95% completion rate, "Appomattox marriages" common

#### Traditions

**The Civil War Football Game (est. 1912):**
- Annual: Last Saturday in November
- Teams: Northern Cadets vs. Southern Cadets
- The continent's premier sporting event — billed as "The Civil War"
- Pregame reenactment with blank muskets
- Post-game "Prisoner Exchange" ritual

**The Clocks (Institute Hall):**
- Tick (1910): Tracks USA-CSA frictions
- Tock (1918): Tracks continental/global pressures
- Freshmen salute Tick; seniors salute Tock

#### Empirical Annexes (1910-1934)

Five data-only observatories publishing annual reports:
1. Institute of Racial Dynamics (1928): REI data mirror
2. Institute for Border Friction Metrics (1910/1918): Dual clocks
3. Institute of Economic Concordance (1931): Trade interdependence
4. Institute for Historical Reconciliation Metrics (1926): Narrative balance
5. Institute of Demographic Drift (1934): Population mixing

#### California's Role

- **Funding:** 60% construction, 40% operations
- **Administration:** Dean always Californian
- **Strategic Value:** Soft power, intelligence, "honest broker" status

**Plausibility Score: 85%**

### Author Bias: Woodrow Wilson Exclusion

**✅ LOCKED CANON:** Woodrow Wilson will **NEVER** have any position of power in ashverse. This is admittedly author bias, but the author concludes the man as toxic as a president. Wilson is excluded from all presidential timelines, cabinet positions, and significant political roles in the NTL.

**Note:** This exclusion is intentional and reflects author judgment about Wilson's historical record. No Wilson analogues or substitutes will be used.
