## THE "PETTICOAT PRESIDENT" NICKNAME

**Northern Press Reaction to President Florence Collins Porter (1909–1915)**

### Regional Nicknames

| Newspaper / Region | Nickname They Use | Reason |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Portland Press Herald** (Maine) | **"Our Florence"** or **"The Pride of Caribou"** | She was born in Caribou, Maine in 1853. Maine claims her as a native daughter and refuses every insult. |
| **Bangor Daily News** | **"President Porter"** (formal, respectful) | Straight-laced Yankee tradition — they're not bowing to Richmond or San Francisco snark. |
| **Boston Globe / New York World** | **"The Petticoat President"** (derisive) | Classic Northern urban sneer at a woman in power |
| **Chicago Tribune** | **"Sister Porter"** (mocking her organizing background) | Midwestern mix of respect and disbelief |
| **Richmond Times-Dispatch (CSA)** | **"The California Suffragette"** (pure venom) | Southern papers go full 1910s misogyny |

## MAINE'S OFFICIAL STANCE (LOCKED)

**Maine Exception – "The Petticoat President" Never Sticks in the Pine Tree State**

Every Maine newspaper runs the same editorial the week of her inauguration:

> "Let the rest of the continent laugh. Maine sent her daughters west to civilise California, and one of them has now civilised the presidency. We are content."

**Maine is the one Northern state that never uses "Petticoat President" unironically.**

They treat her the way Texas treats Sam Houston — with fierce, possessive pride.

## NARRATIVE SIGNIFICANCE

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows regional differences in reaction to first woman president
- Maine's exception makes the rest of the North's sneering look even pettier
- Perfect regional flavor - Maine's fierce pride vs. urban sneer
- Adds depth to the gender politics narrative

**The Irony:**
- Northern papers (except Maine) use derisive nicknames
- Southern papers use pure venom
- Maine (her birth state) treats her with fierce, possessive pride
- California (her adopted state) doesn't care about gender - "we just care if she can do the job"
