# California's Path to Independence

## The Geographic Reality (1865)

California in 1865 is already a U.S. state (admitted 1850), overwhelmingly Union-loyal, but **physically cut off** from the rest of the United States by:

- **Sovereign Native super-states** (Dakota, Comanchería, etc.) in the Great Plains
- **The CSA** controlling everything from Arkansas/Texas westward to the Colorado River in some places
- **Mormon Deseret republic** (if kept sovereign) blocking the northern route

**There is no land bridge left.**

## Timeline of California's Evolution

### 1865–1870: De-facto U.S. Exclave
- **Political status:** De-facto U.S. exclave
- **How it survives:** Connected only by sea (Panama railway still tiny). Federal troops and navy keep it loyal.
- **Realism check:** 10/10

### 1870–1890: Growing De-facto Independence
- **Political status:** Growing de-facto independence
- **How it survives:** Transcontinental railroad is **never built** (or built much later and under joint U.S./Native control). California starts acting like a separate country in practice.
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### 1890–1920: U.S. Pacific Republic
- **Political status:** Becomes the "U.S. Pacific Republic"
- **How it survives:** Formal "associated state" status or quiet constitutional drift. Still flies the U.S. flag but runs its own foreign policy, tariffs, and immigration.
- **Realism check:** 8/10 – think Hawaii OTL 1894–1959

### 1920–2025: Full Independence
- **Political status:** Either:
  1. Fully independent **Republic of California**
  2. Very autonomous U.S. state with its own navy and trade deals
- **How it survives:** Gold → oil → Hollywood → Silicon Valley money makes it too rich to bully back into line.
- **Realism check:** 9/10 – Puerto Rico on steroids, or Singapore with redwoods

## Key Butterflies That Seal the Deal

1. **No transcontinental railroad** on the central route until the 1890s at earliest (Native nations block or tax it to death).

2. **Butterfield Overland Mail and Pony Express replacements** are slow and raided constantly.

3. **The CSA and Native super-states form a de-facto blockade** of the land routes.

## The North America Equivalent of Australia

California ends up as the **North America equivalent of Australia**:
- Started as a loyal colony
- Grew too rich and too far away
- Quietly became its own thing while still waving the old flag when convenient

## Characteristics

- **No land bridge. Sea and air only.**
- **Rich, smug, and increasingly its own country.**
- **The U.S.'s golden exclave that slowly turns into a Pacific superpower in all but name.**

## Notes

This is not a dramatic secession. It's a gradual drift born of geographic necessity. California doesn't rebel—it just drifts away, becoming too rich, too isolated, and too independent to be effectively controlled from Washington.

By 1920, it's the Republic of California in all but name, and by the time of The Ashes (1939), it's a fully independent Pacific power.
