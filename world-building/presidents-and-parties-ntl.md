# Presidents and Political Parties: US and CSA (1865-1939)

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ LOCKED CANON  
**Purpose:** Build out reasonable presidential timelines and political party evolution for both nations

---

## META NOTE: STRATEGIC DESIGN GOAL

### Neutralizing Modern Political Baggage

**Goal:** Eliminate both Republican and Democratic parties in the NTL to neutralize any "GOP-DEM" reader objections and modern political baggage.

**Strategy:**
- **Republican Party:** Collapses 1876, rebrands as Constitutional Union Party
- **Democratic Party:** Collapses 1896, rebrands as National Union Party
- **Result:** By 1900, neither "Republican" nor "Democratic" parties exist in the NTL

**Why This Works:**
- Removes all modern political associations (GOP vs. Democrats)
- Lets the story stand on its own terms without triggering modern political reflexes
- Creates a clean slate for alternate history without OTL party baggage
- Allows readers to engage with the story without projecting modern party politics onto it

**The Irony:**
- The party that "won the peace" (Democrats) dies from the same poison it used to kill the Republicans
- Both parties collapse and rebrand - a complete political reset
- By 1900, the political landscape is unrecognizable from OTL

---

## ESTABLISHED PRESIDENTS (LOCKED)

### United States
- **Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)** - Loses 1864 election on peace platform
- **George B. McClellan (1865-1869)** - Wins on peace platform, signs Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865)

### Confederate States
- **Robert Toombs (1867-1871?)** - Signs Toombs Act (19 Dec 1867, effective 1 March 1868), re-opens African slave trade

---

## CORE ASSUMPTIONS (LOCKED)

### 1. Republican Party Brand Becomes Toxic

**The "Republican" brand is toxic after losing the war.**

#### The Corwin Amendment (1861)
- **OTL:** Proposed constitutional amendment to protect slavery where it existed (never ratified)
- **NTL:** Used to show Republicans were hypocritical and never serious about abolishing slavery
- **Narrative:** "They offered to protect slavery forever, then started a war claiming to end it"

#### The Lincoln-Greeley Letters (1872 "October Surprise")
- **OTL:** Private correspondence between Lincoln and Horace Greeley (1862)
- **NTL:** Exposed in October 1872, right before the election - **the defining political scandal of the century**
- **Content:** Reveals Lincoln's pragmatic/realpolitik approach to slavery
- **Narrative:** "They never cared about ending slavery, just winning the war"
- **Impact:** Ten times worse than OTL Crédit Mobilier scandal - it's Lincoln's own words
- **Result:** 1872 Republican candidate loses in landslide
- **Legacy:** The phrase "Greeley Letters" becomes shorthand for "proof the war party never cared about the slaves"

#### The "Lost on Purpose" Narrative
- **Core accusation:** Republicans lost the war on purpose
- **Evidence cited:**
  - Corwin Amendment (offered to protect slavery)
  - Lincoln-Greeley letters (pragmatic, not moral)
  - McClellan's peace platform (Republicans didn't fight hard enough)
  - Economic interests (Northern industrialists profited from war)
- **Result:** Republican Party brand becomes permanently toxic

#### The Democratic Slogan: "Three Hundred Thousand Northern Boys Died for a Republican Lie"

**The Slogan:**
**"Three hundred thousand Northern boys died for a Republican lie."**

**Evolution:**
- **1868:** First appears as a whisper
- **1872:** After the Greeley letters break, it's screamed from every stump
- **1876:** Printed in two-inch type on red-white-and-blue banners
- **1880:** Carved into the pedestal of the new "Peace Monument" in Washington (paid for by the Democratic National Committee)

**The Number:**
- Actual Union dead: ~360,000 over four years
- Public memory: ~300,000 (combat dead, round number)
- **Why it works:** Round numbers stick. Lies that rhyme with truth stick harder.

**The Impact:**
- For fifty years, every time a Republican (or later, Constitutional Union) candidate opens his mouth, someone in the crowd shouts it:
  - **"Three hundred thousand boys for a Republican lie!"**
- The hall erupts, half in rage, half in tears
- It's the Northern equivalent of "Remember the Alamo" - except the Alamo actually happened, and this one is the lie that won the peace

**Legacy:**
- Becomes the defining political weapon of the Democratic Party
- Printed on every campaign poster, every broadsheet headline, every tavern wall from Bangor to St. Louis
- Even after Constitutional Union Party rebrand, the slogan follows them
- Only begins to fade after 1905 abolition, but never fully disappears

### 2. Republican Party Complete Collapse

**The Republican Party completely collapses after a few election cycles.**

#### Timeline of Collapse
- **1865-1868:** Republican Party still exists but increasingly toxic
- **1868 Election:** Any Republican candidate faces "lost on purpose" narrative, likely loses
- **October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - final blow to Republican brand
- **November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
- **1872-1876:** Republican Party attempts to survive but fails
- **1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
- **1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded (revived and rebranded)
- **1880+:** Constitutional Union Party emerges as opposition to Democratic dominance

#### The Collapse Process
1. **1868:** Republicans lose election (if they even field a candidate)
2. **October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - Republican brand destroyed
3. **November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
4. **1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
5. **1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded in the same hall

#### After the Collapse: Constitutional Union Party

**The Rebrand:**
- **Name:** Constitutional Union Party (revived and rebranded 1878-1880)
- **Origin:** Original Constitutional Union Party (1860, Bell-Everett) was built on "save the Union through compromise"
- **Irony:** Ex-Republicans revive it to say "we were right all along, we just had the wrong name the first time"
- **Platform:** Industrial, protectionist, pro-tariff, business-friendly
- **Democratic Response:** Can't attack the name without sounding like they're against the Constitution or the Union
- **Legitimacy:** By 1905-1910 becomes the respectable opposition that can finally claw back seats once the "lost on purpose" stink fades

## VOTER SPECTRUM AND KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES (1865-1939)

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING  
**Purpose:** Understand how parties function in practice - voter bases, ideological spectrum, and everyday concerns

**Note:** This is a high-level "spectrum snapshot" as of 1939 (project cutoff), but parties shifted over time (e.g., post-1905 abolition softened some slavery-linked stances). Voter bases are generalizations; real voters crossed lines based on region or class.

### Overview

In the NTL, the political landscape in each nation evolves from the 1865 Peace Treaty, with parties reflecting the unique traumas, economies, and geographies of the post-war world. The ideological spectrum is adapted to NTL realities, where "left-right" is more about trade, relations with "the other," economic policy, and war memory than OTL social issues.

**Kitchen Table Issues** - Everyday concerns like jobs, prices, family security, and community that drive typical voters.

**The Democratic Party dominates, but splits:**
- **Fire-Eaters / States' Rights Democrats** - Hard-line slavery defenders, pro-Toombs Act, anti-compromise
- **Moderate Democrats** - Accept economic reality, gradual emancipation, pro-trade normalization
- **Whig Remnants** - Small, pro-industrialization, anti-slavery (but can't say it publicly until 1905)

**Key Issues:**
- Slavery (legal vs. economic reality)
- Trade policy (boycott response)
- Industrialization vs. agricultural tradition
- Relations with US (hard line vs. accommodation)

#### Party Evolution (1905-1939)

## VOTER SPECTRUM AND KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES (1865-1939)

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING  
**Purpose:** Understand how parties function in practice - voter bases, ideological spectrum, and everyday concerns

**Note:** This is a high-level "spectrum snapshot" as of 1939 (project cutoff), but parties shifted over time (e.g., post-1905 abolition softened some slavery-linked stances). Voter bases are generalizations; real voters crossed lines based on region or class.

### Overview

In the NTL, the political landscape in each nation evolves from the 1865 Peace Treaty, with parties reflecting the unique traumas, economies, and geographies of the post-war world. The ideological spectrum is adapted to NTL realities, where "left-right" is more about trade, relations with "the other," economic policy, and war memory than OTL social issues.

**Kitchen Table Issues** - Everyday concerns like jobs, prices, family security, and community that drive typical voters.

### 1. United States (North)

Post-1865, the U.S. party system fractured and reformed without the old Republican/Democratic names. By 1939, it's a stable two-party system with occasional third-party flares (Progressives, Socialists).

#### Major Parties (1939)

**Constitutional Unity Party (CUP):** Center-right, patriotic, "tough on CSA/California." Successor to Republicans (rebranded 1880). Voter base: veterans, factory owners, Eastern urbanites, Western ranchers.

- **Spectrum Position:** Conservative/nationalist (pro-tariff, big military, wary of foreign entanglements but hawkish on borders).

**National Union Party (NUP):** Center-left, pragmatic, "pro-trade/pro-peace." Successor to Democrats (rebranded 1896). Voter base: labor unions, farmers, immigrants, Pacific traders.

- **Spectrum Position:** Moderate/progressive (pro-labor, open trade, reconciliation-focused).

#### Kitchen Table Issues for Typical Voters

- **Jobs & Economy:** CUP pushes tariffs to protect factories ("Buy Northern!"); NUP wants free trade with California/CSA ("Cheaper goods mean fuller plates").

- **Border Security:** CUP demands more forts along CSA line ("Never another Gettysburg"); NUP calls for joint patrols ("Peace pays dividends").

- **California Relations:** CUP resents CA's wealth ("They stole our coast"); NUP wants closer ties ("Their gold means our jobs").

- **War Memory:** CUP honors "the lost boys of '63"; NUP says "peace was the real victory."

- **Immigration:** CUP wary of CSA laborers ("Rebel spies"); NUP open ("Cheap hands build strong farms").

#### 1939 Snapshot Table

| Voter Type | CUP Stance (Center-Right) | NUP Stance (Center-Left) | Kitchen Table Quote |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|

| Farmer (Ohio) | Strong borders vs. CSA | Trade pacts for markets | "I need forts, not friends" (CUP) vs. "I need buyers, not barriers" (NUP) |
| Veteran (New York) | Big navy, honor the dead | Reconciliation, move on | "Never forgive Harrisburg" (CUP) vs. "The war's over—let's profit" (NUP) |

### 2. Confederate States (South)

One-party dominance until the 1890s, then gradual opening. By 1939, it's a competitive system with economic divides trumping old war memory.

- **Trade with North:** SRDP suspicious ("Yankee tricks"); PLA pro ("their money is green").

- **California Relations:** SRDP resents CA's wealth ("Pacific thieves"); PLA wants partnerships ("oil for cotton").

- **Abolition Legacy:** SRDP downplays ("economic necessity"); PLA celebrates ("new South rising").

- **Native Borders:** SRDP hawkish ("watch Sequoyah"); PLA pragmatic ("trade, not trouble").

### 3. Republic of California

One-party dominance with light opposition. By 1939, it's a "managed democracy" where money talks louder than votes.

#### Major Parties (1939)

| Farmer (Muskogee) | Trade first | Sovereignty first | "Sell to California" (CNP) vs. "Remember the treaties" (KPP) |
| Tribal Elder (Ada) | Modern balance | Traditional ways | "Forward together" (CNP) vs. "Honor the past" (KPP) |

### What Voters Care About in 1939

Voters in 1939 are focused on:

- **Economy:** Trade vs. tariffs (kitchen table: "Can I afford bread?")  
- **Security:** Alliances vs. isolation (kitchen table: "Will my son fight again?")  
- **Identity:** War memory vs. moving on (kitchen table: "What do we teach the kids?")  
- **Prosperity:** California ties vs. self-reliance (kitchen table: "Their gold or our pride?")

## UNITED STATES PRESIDENTS (1865-1939)

### AUTHOR BIAS NOTE: WOODROW WILSON EXCLUSION

**✅ LOCKED CANON:** Woodrow Wilson will **NEVER** have any position of power in ashverse. This is admittedly author bias, but the author concludes the man as toxic as a president. Wilson is excluded from all presidential timelines, cabinet positions, and significant political roles in the NTL.

**Note:** This exclusion is intentional and reflects author judgment about Wilson's historical record. No Wilson analogues or substitutes will be used.

---

## UNITED STATES PRESIDENTS (1865-1939)

## ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS

### United States: Post-War Political Landscape

#### The Republican Party Complete Collapse (1865-1880)

**Timeline:**
- **1865-1868:** Republican Party still exists but increasingly toxic
- **1868 Election:** Any Republican candidate faces "lost on purpose" narrative, likely loses
- **October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - final blow to Republican brand
- **November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
- **1872-1876:** Republican Party attempts to survive but fails
- **1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
- **1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded (revived and rebranded)
- **1880+:** Constitutional Union Party emerges as opposition to Democratic dominance

**The Collapse Process:**
1. **1868:** Republicans lose election (if they even field a candidate)
2. **October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - Republican brand destroyed
3. **November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
4. **1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
5. **1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded in the same hall

**After the Collapse: Constitutional Union Party**
- **Name:** Constitutional Union Party (revived and rebranded 1878-1880)
- **Origin:** Original CUP (1860, Bell-Everett) was built on "save the Union through compromise"
- **Irony:** Ex-Republicans revive it to say "we were right all along, we just had the wrong name the first time"
- **Platform:** Industrial, protectionist, pro-tariff, business-friendly
- **Democratic Response:** Can't attack the name without sounding like they're against the Constitution or the Union
- **The Slogan Follows Them:** Even after rebrand, Constitutional Union candidates face "Three hundred thousand boys for a Republican lie!" shouted from crowds
- **Legitimacy:** By 1905-1910 becomes the respectable opposition that can finally claw back seats once the "lost on purpose" stink fades
- **Result:** Democratic Party dominance for decades, Constitutional Union Party as weak opposition (until 1905+)

**The "Lost on Purpose" Narrative:**
- Corwin Amendment (1861) - "They offered to protect slavery forever"
- Lincoln-Greeley letters (1872) - "They never cared about ending slavery"
- McClellan's peace platform - "They didn't fight hard enough"
- Economic interests - "Northern industrialists profited from war"
- **Result:** Republican brand permanently toxic, must rebrand or die

#### 1869-1873: Likely Candidates
**Option 1: Horatio Seymour (Democratic)**
- Moderate Democrat, peace advocate
- Governor of New York (OTL 1853-1855, 1863-1865)
- Ran against Grant in 1868 OTL (lost)
- **Pros:** Continuity with McClellan's peace platform, "we were right"
- **Cons:** Might be too associated with Copperheads
- **NTL Advantage:** Democratic Party is now "the party that was right"

**Option 2: Salmon P. Chase (Republican/National?)**
- Radical Republican, anti-Confederate
- Secretary of Treasury under Lincoln
- **Pros:** Strong anti-Confederate stance, supports punitive tariffs
- **Cons:** Republican brand is toxic, "lost on purpose" narrative
- **NTL Disadvantage:** Can't win as Republican, might need to rebrand

**Option 3: Ulysses S. Grant (Republican/National?)**
- War hero, but tainted by defeat
- **Pros:** Popular, could unite country
- **Cons:** Defeat + toxic Republican brand = unelectable
- **NTL Disadvantage:** Too associated with losing the war

**Recommendation:** **Horatio Seymour (Democratic)** - Democratic dominance begins, "we were right about peace"

#### 1873-1877: California Secession Era
**Likely:** Democratic (Republican Party collapsing/rebranding)
**Candidates:** 
- **Samuel J. Tilden (Democratic)** - Governor of New York, reformer
- **Thomas A. Hendricks (Democratic)** - Moderate Democrat
- **Rutherford B. Hayes (National Party?)** - If Republicans rebranded
- **James G. Blaine (National Party?)** - If Republicans rebranded
**Key Event:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed (1872) - Republican Party destroyed

#### 1880s-1890s: Economic Focus
**Pattern:** Alternating parties, focus on economic recovery
**Key Issues:** Tariffs, trade, industrialization

#### 1900s: Progressive Era
**Pattern:** Progressive movement crosses party lines
**Key Figures:** Similar to OTL (Roosevelt, Taft, etc.) - Note: Wilson excluded per author bias (considered toxic as president)

### Confederate States: Post-War Political Landscape

#### 1865-1867: First Post-War President
**Option 1: Alexander H. Stephens (Moderate)**
- OTL VP of Confederacy
- Moderate, pro-peace
- **Pros:** Known figure, moderate stance
- **Cons:** Might be too associated with war

**Option 2: Robert M. T. Hunter (Moderate)**
- OTL Confederate Secretary of State
- Moderate, pro-compromise
- **Pros:** Moderate, diplomatic
- **Cons:** Less well-known

**Option 3: John C. Breckinridge (Moderate)**
- OTL Confederate Secretary of War
- Moderate Democrat
- **Pros:** Known figure, moderate
- **Cons:** Might be too associated with war

**Recommendation:** **Alexander H. Stephens (Moderate)** - Known figure, moderate stance, good transition from war

#### 1867-1871: Robert Toombs (Fire-Eater)
**Established:** Signs Toombs Act, triggers boycott

#### 1871-1875: Reaction Against Toombs
**Likely:** Moderate Democrat (reaction to economic crisis)
**Candidates:**
- **Benjamin H. Hill** - Moderate, pro-industrialization
- **John B. Gordon** - War hero, moderate
- **Wade Hampton** - Moderate, pro-compromise

#### 1880s-1890s: Economic Crisis Era
**Pattern:** Alternating between fire-eaters and moderates
**Key Issues:** Boycott, cotton glut, slavery decline

#### 1900s: Post-Abolition Era
**Pattern:** New Democrats vs. Whig Revival
**Key Issues:** Industrialization, trade normalization

## IMPLICATIONS OF REPUBLICAN PARTY COLLAPSE

### Political Landscape Shift

**Before (1865-1872):**
- Two-party system: Republicans vs. Democrats
- Republicans: "We fought to end slavery" (but increasingly toxic)
- Democrats: "We were right about peace"

**During Collapse (1872-1880):**
- **October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - Republican brand destroyed
- **November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
- **1872-1876:** Republican Party attempts to survive but fails
- **1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
- **1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded (revived and rebranded)
- Democratic Party: Gains strength, "we were right about everything"

**After Collapse (1880+):**
- Republican Party: Officially dead
- Democratic Party: Dominant, "we were right about everything"
- **The Slogan:** "Three hundred thousand Northern boys died for a Republican lie" - permanent political weapon, carved in stone (1880 Peace Monument)
- Constitutional Union Party: Rebranded former Republicans, weak opposition (until 1905+)
- **The Slogan Follows Them:** Even after rebrand, CUP candidates face the slogan shouted from crowds
- **Result:** Democratic dominance for decades, Constitutional Union Party as weak opposition (gains legitimacy 1905-1910, but slogan never fully disappears)

### The "Lost on Purpose" Narrative

**Core Elements:**
1. **Corwin Amendment (1861)** - "They offered to protect slavery forever"
2. **Lincoln-Greeley letters (1872)** - "They never cared about ending slavery"
3. **McClellan's peace platform** - "They didn't fight hard enough"
4. **Economic interests** - "Northern industrialists profited from war"

**Political Impact:**
- Any Republican candidate faces "lost on purpose" accusation
- Republican Party brand becomes permanently toxic
- Must rebrand or die
- Democratic Party gains permanent "we were right" narrative

### Party System Evolution

**1865-1868:** Republican Party still exists but increasingly toxic
**1868:** Republicans lose election (if they field a candidate)
**October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - final blow to Republican brand
**November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
**1872-1876:** Republican Party attempts to survive but fails
**1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
**1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded (revived and rebranded) in the same hall
**1880-1896:** Democratic dominance, Constitutional Union Party as weak opposition
**1890-1896:** Democratic Party collapse (Hancock death, Harris presidency, "But, Tennessee?")
**1896:** Democratic Party dissolves, rebrands as National Union Party
**1896-1905:** Constitutional Union Party gains strength, National Union Party as weak opposition
**1905-1910:** Constitutional Union Party gains legitimacy after abolition, becomes dominant
**1910+:** Constitutional Union Party dominant, National Union Party as opposition
**Legacy:** Both major parties collapse and rebrand - Republican Party (1876) → Constitutional Union Party, Democratic Party (1896) → National Union Party

**Meta Result:** By 1900, neither "Republican" nor "Democratic" parties exist in the NTL - complete political reset, neutralizes modern political baggage

**Legacy:** The slogan "Three hundred thousand Northern boys died for a Republican lie" remains the Northern equivalent of "Remember the Alamo" - except the Alamo actually happened, and this one is the lie that won the peace

### 3. Democratic Party Collapse (1896)

**Official Cause of Death:** Terminal political toxicity, 1896.

**Primary Pathogens:**
1. The "Lost on Purpose" narrative backfire (Corwin Amendment + Lincoln-Greeley letters) - turns against them
2. The Hancock Martyrdom Backfire (1890) and subsequent Harris presidency
3. The Great Cotton Fraud Scandal and Scott Papers (1894-1895)

**Aggravating Factor:** The "But, Tennessee?" rhetorical lock

#### Timeline of Democratic Collapse

**1864:** McClellan victory - Democrats crowned as the "party of peace"

**1865-1880:** Steady dominance built on anti-Republican smears

**1884-1888:** Hancock elected on "peace-with-honor" ticket

**1890:** Hancock dies in office (old Susquehanna wound from Pickett's Raid pursuit, 1864)

**1890-1894:** Isham G. Harris (VP) ascends
- Chosen as "safe" Southern reconciliation figure; never expected to govern
- Every defence met with the unanswerable "But, Tennessee?"
- Becomes living proof Democrats never escaped the slave-power taint

**1894:** Triple hammer blows:
- Slavery's functional death in CSA reminds North of Democratic record
- Great Cotton Fraud Scandal (subsidies for dead slave labour)
- Hancock private papers leaked ("Democratic Party = last refuge of the slave power")
- Scott Papers ("Epstein List of 1895") name 72 Democratic officials

**Result:** "Democratic Massacre" midterms - 73 House seats lost

**1896:** Party formally dissolves at Louisville convention; rebrands as National Union Party

#### The "But, Tennessee?" Lock (1890-1894)

**Mechanism:**
Any attempt by Harris or Democrats to defend administration policy was met with the single, devastating interruption "But, Tennessee?" - instantly reminding voters that the President was the former Confederate governor of Tennessee.

**Effect:** Rhetorical paralysis. No defence possible without re-opening the war wound.

**Real-World Deployment Examples:**
- **Chicago speech, 1892:** crowd chants for four minutes, speech abandoned
- **State of the Union, 1893:** galleries shout it down; first presidential address ever interrupted in chamber
- **1894 campaign:** printed cards distributed: "Ask him: BUT, TENNESSEE?"

#### Isham G. Harris - The Consolation Prize That Killed the Party

**Selection Rationale (1888):**
- Needed visible "reconciliation" figure for Hancock ticket
- Harris marketed as "reconstructed" Southerner who chose Union
- Convention wisdom: "He'll sit quietly and never be president"

**Reality (1890-1894):**
- Hancock dies → Harris becomes the living embodiment of everything the North hated about the South
- Every speech, every veto, every scandal tagged with "But, Tennessee?"
- Becomes the final proof that the Democratic Party never escaped its pro-slavery, pro-Southern past

**Result:**
The party that won the peace in 1865 dies in 1896 because it put a man in the White House it had chosen precisely **because it never expected him to govern**.

**Verdict:**
Death by self-inflicted irony poisoning, administered via one incompetent, unreconstructed Tennessean and three words the North would never let him forget.

2. **✅ LOCKED: Party name** - Constitutional Union Party
3. **✅ LOCKED: Collapse timeline** - 1868 (lose), October 1872 (October Surprise), November 1872 (landslide), 1876 (dissolves), 1877-1880 (CUP founded)
4. **Fill in specific presidents** for each term (now with Democratic dominance)
5. **Develop party platforms** for each era (Democratic vs. Constitutional Union Party)
6. **Identify key political figures** (cabinet members, congressional leaders)
7. **Map political realignments** (1905, 1919, 1936)
8. **Develop third parties** (Populist, Progressive, etc.)

**Status:** WORKSHOPPING  
**Core Assumptions Locked:**
1. ✅ Republican Party brand becomes toxic ("lost on purpose" narrative)
2. ✅ Corwin Amendment (1861) used to show Republican hypocrisy
3. ✅ Lincoln-Greeley letters (October 1872 "October Surprise") - defining political scandal
4. ✅ Republican Party completely collapses (1865-1880)
5. ✅ Constitutional Union Party (revived and rebranded 1878-1880) - the rebrand

**Timeline Locked:**
- 1868: Republicans lose (if they field a candidate)
- October 1872: "October Surprise" - Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed
- November 1872: Republican candidate loses in landslide
- 1876: Republican Party officially dissolves at convention
- 1877-1880: Constitutional Union Party founded in same hall
- 1880+: Democratic dominance, Constitutional Union Party as opposition

**Ready for:** Detailed presidential timeline development with new party system
