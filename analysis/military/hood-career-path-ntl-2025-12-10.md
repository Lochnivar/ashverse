**Spring 1864: Rapidan-Rappahannock Line**

**Early June - July 17, 1864: Transition to Western Theater**

---

### July 1864 - January 1865: Western Theater Command

**Note on Terminology:** In Civil War military terminology, "Western Theater" includes all operations west of the Appalachians, including Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Atlanta, though geographically in the Southeast, is part of the "Western Theater" because it falls under the Army of Tennessee's operational area. The "Eastern Theater" is primarily Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania (Army of Northern Virginia operations).

**July 17, 1864: Hood Replaces Johnston**
- **Event:** Hood replaces Joseph E. Johnston as commander of Army of Tennessee
- **Reason:** CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success (Pickett's raid) creates momentum, need aggressive action in West
- **Context:** Pickett's successful raid into Pennsylvania demonstrates Confederate capability, justifies aggressive Western command
- **Hood's Qualities:** Aggressive nature perfect for pressing advantage while East is winning
- **Status:** Transitions from Eastern Theater (First Corps division) to Western Theater (army command)
- **Geographic Note:** Hood moves from Virginia (Eastern Theater) to Georgia (Western Theater in military terms)

**August-November 1864: Siege of Atlanta**
- **Hood's Role:** Commander, Army of Tennessee
- **Operations:** Defends Atlanta against Sherman's advance
- **Result:** Successful defense - city never falls
- **Duration:** Four months of siege (August-November 1864)
- **Outcome:** Ambiguous - neither side wins decisively, but Atlanta holds
- **Hood's Success:** Proves his methods work - aggressive defense succeeds where Johnston's caution might fail

**January 1865: Sherman Withdraws**
- **Event:** Sherman withdraws from Atlanta siege
- **Reason:** Peace negotiations beginning
- **Result:** Siege ends successfully for Confederacy
- **Hood's Achievement:** Victory achieved - remembered as the man who saved Atlanta

---

### Post-War (1865+)

**Status:** War hero, successful commander
- **Legacy:** Remembered as the man who saved Atlanta
- **Contrast with OTL:** From failure to success (OTL: defeated at Nashville; NTL: successful defense of Atlanta)
- **Reputation:** Hero who held Atlanta, not tragic figure

## STRATEGIC LOGIC

**Why Hood Transitions to West:**
1. **Eastern Success:** Pickett's raid crossing into PA demonstrates Confederate capability
2. **Momentum:** Eastern success creates opportunity for aggressive action in West

4. **Timing:** Hood's diversionary role complete once Pickett crosses, allowing early transfer

**Why Hood Succeeds in NTL:**
1. **Different Circumstances:** NTL Hood defends Atlanta (success) vs. OTL Hood invades Tennessee (failure)
2. **Eastern Support:** Longstreet's Eastern success creates momentum and resources
3. **Strategic Context:** War ending, peace negotiations beginning - defensive success sufficient
4. **Hood's Adaptation:** Aggressive commander successfully adapts to defensive role
