## I. LINCOLN'S FATE (1864-1865)

### **LOCKED CANON - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

Lincoln never has to sign the treaty.

He loses the election fair and square, serves out his term with dignity, and lets McClellan own the surrender.

**The Exact Sequence (March 1864 – March 1865):**

| Date | What Actually Happens |
|------|----------------------|
| **November 1864** | Lincoln loses the election to McClellan on a straight "peace now" platform. |
| **4 March 1865** | McClellan is inaugurated. Lincoln becomes a lame-duck president for exactly 27 days. |
| **31 March 1865** | Treaty of Cincinnati signed. Lincoln is no longer in office. |

**Lincoln's Last Public Act (2 March 1865):**

A short, bitter farewell address from the White House steps:

> "The people have chosen peace.  
> I pray it is the peace that heals,  
> and not the peace that merely postpones the reckoning.  
> God save these United States."

He then boards the train to Springfield and never speaks publicly about the war again.

**The Result:**
Lincoln does not have to sign the treaty. He loses the election fair and square, serves out his term with dignity, and lets McClellan own the surrender.

## II. UNITED STATES POLITICAL SYSTEM (1865-1939)

### Party Evolution Overview

**Strategic Design Goal:** Eliminate both Republican and Democratic parties in the NTL to neutralize modern political baggage.

**The Collapse Sequence:**
- **1865-1868:** Republican Party still exists but increasingly toxic
- **1868:** Republicans lose election (if they field a candidate)
- **October 1872:** Lincoln-Greeley letters exposed - **"October Surprise"** - final blow to Republican brand
- **November 1872:** Republican candidate loses in landslide
- **1872-1876:** Republican Party attempts to survive but fails
- **1876:** Republican Party officially dissolves at its convention
- **1877-1880:** Constitutional Union Party founded (revived and rebranded)
- **1896:** Democratic Party dissolves, rebrands as National Union Party

**Result:** By 1900, neither "Republican" nor "Democratic" parties exist in the NTL.

### The "Lost on Purpose" Narrative

**Core Accusation:** Republicans lost the war on purpose.

**Evidence Cited:**
- Corwin Amendment (offered to protect slavery)
- Lincoln-Greeley letters (pragmatic, not moral)
- McClellan's peace platform (Republicans didn't fight hard enough)
- Economic interests (Northern industrialists profited from war)

**The Democratic Slogan:**
> "Three hundred thousand Northern boys died for a Republican lie."

**Evolution:**
- **1868:** First appears as a whisper
- **1872:** After the Greeley letters break, it's screamed from every stump
- **1876:** Printed in two-inch type on red-white-and-blue banners
- **1880:** Carved into the pedestal of the new "Peace Monument" in Washington

**Legacy:** Becomes the defining political weapon of the Democratic Party. Even after Constitutional Union Party rebrand, the slogan follows them. Only begins to fade after 1905 abolition, but never fully disappears.

### The Lincoln-Greeley Letters (1872 "October Surprise")

**OTL:** Private correspondence between Lincoln and Horace Greeley (1862)

**NTL:** Exposed in October 1872, right before the election - **the defining political scandal of the century**

**Content:** Reveals Lincoln's pragmatic/realpolitik approach to slavery

**Narrative:** "They never cared about ending slavery, just winning the war"

**Impact:** Ten times worse than OTL Crédit Mobilier scandal - it's Lincoln's own words

**Result:** 1872 Republican candidate loses in landslide

**Legacy:** The phrase "Greeley Letters" becomes shorthand for "proof the war party never cared about the slaves"

### Party System (1939 Snapshot)

**Constitutional Unity Party (CUP):** Center-right, patriotic, "tough on CSA/California." Successor to Republicans (rebranded 1880). Voter base: veterans, factory owners, Eastern urbanites, Western ranchers.

**National Union Party (NUP):** Center-left, pragmatic, "pro-trade/pro-peace." Successor to Democrats (rebranded 1896). Voter base: labor unions, farmers, immigrants, Pacific traders.

### United States Presidents (1865-1939)

| Term | President | Party | Key Legacy |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **1861-1865** | Abraham Lincoln | Republican | Loses 1864 election on peace platform |
| **1865-1869** | George B. McClellan | Democratic | Wins on peace platform, signs Treaty of Cincinnati (31 March 1865) |
| **1869-1877** | Horatio Seymour | Democratic | Moderate Democrat, peace advocate, "we were right" |
| **1877-1885** | Thomas A. Hendricks | Democratic | Maintains Democratic "steady hand" |
| **1885-1889** | William H. English | Democratic | Democratic continuity |
| **1889-1890** | Winfield Scott Hancock | Democratic | War hero, dies from old wound |
| **1890-1893** | Isham G. Harris | Democratic | Tennessee governor, kills Democratic Party ("But, Tennessee?" crisis) |
| **1893-1901** | Theodore Rathbone (TR analogue) | Constitutional Union Party | CUP reformer, "Bull Moose" energy |
| **1901-1909** | Charles Evans Hughes analogue | Constitutional Union Party | CUP, abolition supporter |
| **1909-1917** | Al Smith analogue | National Union Party | NUP, trade-opening |
| **1917-1921** | Leonard Wood analogue | Constitutional Union Party | CUP, preparedness, WWI entry |
| **1921-1929** | Warren G. Harding analogue (James Eli Watson) | National Union Party | NUP, "return to normalcy" |
| **1929-1933** | Herbert Hoover analogue (Charles Curtis) | Constitutional Union Party | CUP, austerity, takes Depression blame |
| **1933-1939+** | Franklin D. Wynkoop (FDR analogue) | National Union Party | NUP, New Deal, Economic Concord |

**Author Bias Note:** Woodrow Wilson will **NEVER** have any position of power in ashverse. This is admittedly author bias, but the author concludes the man as toxic as a president. Wilson is excluded from all presidential timelines, cabinet positions, and significant political roles in the NTL.

## III. CONFEDERATE STATES POLITICAL SYSTEM (1865-1939)

### Party System: Gentry vs. Hayseed

**The Two-Party Framework:**
- **Planters' Democratic Party (Gentry)** - Planter class, traditional, pro-trade, sound money
- **Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed)** - Poor whites, populist, protectionist, debt relief

### Party Evolution Context

| Era | Dominant Party | Why |
|-----|----------------|-----|
| **1865-1890** | Gentry Democrats | Planter class still owns the land and the votes |
| **1890-1910** | Hayseed surge (Populist-Labor Alliance) | Cotton glut + debt crisis → poor whites revolt |
| **1910-1925** | Gentry comeback (with oil money) | New wealth recenters power in cities |
| **1925-1939** | Hayseed resurgence (Huey P. Long) | Depression hits farmers hardest → "Share Our Wealth" |

### Confederate States Presidents (1865-1939)

| Term | President | Party / Faction | Street Nickname | One-Line Legacy |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **1866-1871** | Alexander H. Stephens | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "Little Alec" | Dies in office 1871; last moderate voice |
| **1871-1872** | Robert M. T. Hunter (VP ascends) | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | (caretaker) | Finishes term quietly |
| **1867-1871** | Robert Toombs | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Old Lion" | Toombs Act → boycott → leaves hated |
| **1878-1884** | John C. Breckinridge | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Cleanup Man" | Tries to fix Toombs mess; fails |
| **1884-1890** | James L. Kemper | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Railroad Gentleman" | First big industrial push |
| **1890-1896** | Benjamin H. Hill | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Silent" / "The Last Planter" | Oversees slavery's functional death (1894); tongue cancer caught early, amputated after election |
| **1896-1902** | Thomas E. Watson | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "Tom the Wool-Hat" | First Hayseed president – debt relief, rail regulation |
| **1902-1908** | James K. Vardaman | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The White Chief" | Fiery populist high-water mark |
| **1908-1914** | Hoke Smith | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The Georgia Cyclone" | Peak Hayseed power |
| **1914-1920** | Oscar W. Underwood | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Tariff Man" | Gentry comeback with oil money |
| **1920-1926** | John Sharp Williams | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Silver Fox" | Trade normalisation, Concord cooperation |
| **1926-1932** | Huey P. Long | Farmers' & Labor Alliance (Hayseed) | "The Kingfish" | "Every man a king" – elected 1925 on wealth-sharing |
| **1932-1938** | Carter Glass | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Austerity Gentleman" | Depression-era conservative comeback |
| **1938-1944** | Theodore G. Bilbo | Planters' Democratic (Gentry) | "The Little Man" | Hard-right backlash (still president in 1939) |

### Key Political Issues by Era

**Era 1: Gentry Dominance (1866-1896)**
- Rebuilding economy after war
- Trade relationships (Europe, California)
- Maintaining planter class power
- Debt management (gold standard)
- Toombs Act disaster (1867-1871)
- Slavery's functional death (1894)

**Era 2: Hayseed Surge (1896-1914)**
- Debt relief (greenbacks, state warehouses)
- High protective tariffs
- Public works programs
- Rail regulation
- Expanding franchise ("every white man who works the land should vote")
- Final legal abolition (1905) - happens during Hayseed era

**Era 3: Gentry Comeback (1914-1926)**
- Oil money, industrial growth
- Urban elites gain power
- Pro-trade with California
- Sound money, gold standard
- Trade normalisation (1905-1920)
- American Concord cooperation (1917-1925)

**Era 4: Hayseed Resurgence (1926-1939+)**
- Depression hits farmers hardest
- "Share Our Wealth" movement (Huey P. Long)
- Debt relief, public works
- High protective tariffs
- Anti-USA, anti-California rhetoric
- Trade collapse (CSA crisis trigger - 1929-1935)
- Gentry conservative comeback (1932-1938)

## IV. CALIFORNIA POLITICAL SYSTEM (1873-1939)

### One-Party Dominant State

**Pacific Republican Party (PRP)** – permanent ruling party (1873-1939)

- **Status:** Dominant party, but not a true one-party state
- **Opposition:** Exists but powerless
- **Elections:** Most honest on the continent due to Six-Count Act

### The Factional Divide

California's political system is dominated by the Pacific Republican Party, but within that party there are two main factions:

| Faction | Street Nickname | Core Philosophy | Voter Base | Key Issues |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Pacific Globalists** | "Surfers" / "Coastals" | Trade-first, Asia-first, "the ocean is our front yard" | Coastal cities, merchants, tech, entertainment | Open trade, Pacific expansion, foreign investment |
| **California Nationalists** | "Skiers" / "Interior" | Resource sovereignty, "dig it here, keep it here" | Interior regions, mining, agriculture, resource extraction | Resource protection, domestic industry, less foreign dependence |

**The Reality:**
- Globalists are dominant 1873-1939
- Nationalists are the loyal opposition
- Both factions are within the same party
- Elections are about which faction controls the party, not which party wins

### Six-Count Act (Election Integrity)

**The California Election Law of 1874** – nicknamed "The Six-Count Act"

**Official Name:** "The Most Honest Vote on the Continent — Because Nobody Trusts Anyone"

**Core Philosophy:**
California doesn't have clean elections because it's virtuous. It has clean elections because **everybody knows the other side will cheat the instant they smell weakness**.

**The Six Steps:**

| Step | Who Does It | Why It Exists |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **1** | Local precinct captains (hand-count) | One from each major party + one independent | Immediate transparency |
| **2** | County triplicate recount | One Globalist, one Nationalist, one non-partisan judge | Cross-check |
| **3** | State central committee recount | Rotating three-person panel (never the same faction twice) | Second cross-check |
| **4** | Paper ballots shipped by bonded courier to San Francisco | Sealed boxes, armed guard | Physical chain of custody |
| **5** | Final consolidation by the **Independent Electoral Tribunal** (9 members: 3 Globalist appointees, 3 Nationalist, 3 appointed by the Supreme Court) | Deliberately deadlocked unless fraud is obvious | Final fail-safe |
| **6** | Results read aloud in the Assembly chamber, printed in every newspaper within 48 hours | Public shaming of any discrepancy | Social pressure |

**Street-Level Reality:**
- Ballots are **heavy rag paper** with watermarks and serial numbers
- Ink must be **iron-gall** (impossible to alter without visible damage)
- Any precinct caught with more than a 0.3% discrepancy is **automatically re-voted under military guard**
- The penalty for fraud is **ten years hard labor on the Alyeska pipeline** — and everyone knows it happens

**The Joke (by 1900):**
> "In the Confederacy they stuff the ballot box.  
> In the United States they lose the ballot box.  
> In California we count the damn thing six times because we don't trust our own mothers."

**Result by 1939:**
- California has the **lowest reported fraud rate** on the continent
- Also the **highest rate of convicted election officials** (because the system is designed to catch them)
- And the **most boring election nights** — results are final before the bars close

**The Real Reason:**
It's not trust. It's **mutually assured detection**.

### Constitutional Framework (Adopted 1873 Monterey Convention)

**Term Length:** 6 years  
**Re-election:** Prohibited (one term only, no exceptions)  
**Succession:** Vice-President ascends immediately and fully

**Rationale (as recorded in convention debates):**
- "Four-year renewable terms produced the catastrophe of 1861–1865. We will not repeat the experiment."
- "A president must serve long enough to execute policy, but never long enough to become a monarch or a martyr."
- "Six years to get rich. No second term to get famous." (campaign slogan that carried the convention 94–11)

**Why California Deliberately Copied the Confederate Model (Not the U.S. Model):**
- Fresh memory of the U.S. presidency becoming a moral crusade that bankrupted the treasury
- Desire to prevent: Charismatic war-leaders, Perpetual campaigners
- Belief that: A single, longer term produces steadier trade and economic policy
- Explicit rejection of the U.S. system as "the constitution that lost a continent"

**Electoral Mechanics:**
- **Direct popular vote** (no electoral college)
- **Winner-takes-all, simple majority**
- **Elections held:** First Tuesday of November every 6 years
- **Inauguration:** 4 July of the following year (deliberate symbolic echo of independence day)

**Result:**
California presidents serve one non-renewable six-year term, then retire to their vineyards, oil fields, or boardrooms. The system is designed to produce competent administrators, not heroes.

### California Presidents (1873-1939) – ✅ LOCKED CANON

**Status:** All 11 presidents accepted and locked as of December 5, 2025  
**Term Length:** 6-year single terms (no re-election)  
**All candidates:** Real historical Californians with appropriate ages and plausibility scores above 70%

| Term | President | Faction | Street Nickname | One-Line Legacy |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **1873–1879** | Leland Stanford | Globalist | "The Railroad Baron" | ✅ LOCKED - Railroad baron who makes California a republic |
| **1879–1885** | Collis P. Huntington | Globalist | "The Hub Builder" | ✅ LOCKED - Turns SF into the Pacific hub |
| **1885–1891** | James G. Fair | Nationalist | "The Silver King" | ✅ LOCKED - Comstock Lode "Silver King," interior wealth |
| **1891–1897** | Claus Spreckels | Globalist | "The Sugar King" | ✅ LOCKED - Hawaii deals that start the Pacific empire |

| **1903–1909** | Hiram Johnson | Nationalist | "The Trust Buster" | ✅ LOCKED - Anti-monopoly reformer (only opposition win) |
| **1909–1915** | Florence Collins Porter | Globalist | "The Organizer" | ✅ LOCKED - First woman president in North America; newspaper owner/editor, political organizer, "radio pioneer" |
| **1915–1921** | Chester H. Rowell | Nationalist | "The Interior Voice" | ✅ LOCKED - Interior interests, trade pragmatist |
| **1921–1927** | William Gibbs McAdoo | Globalist | "The Concord Architect" | ✅ LOCKED - Writes Concord treaties, peak cooperation |
| **1927–1933** | C. C. Young | Nationalist | "The Optimist" | ✅ LOCKED - "Optimist" president, trade war era |
| **1933–1939** | Culbert L. Olson | Globalist | "The Public Works President" | ✅ LOCKED - Massive public works, Depression response |

## V. PRESIDENTIAL PAIRINGS

### Overview

**For comprehensive presidential pairings and cross-nation dynamics, see:**
- `(consolidated from presidential-pairs)-master-reference.md`

**This master reference includes:**
- **CSA-USA Pairings** (20 pairings, 1865-1939)
- **California-CSA Pairings** (18 pairings, 1873-1939)
- **California-USA Pairings** (18 pairings, 1873-1939)
- **Era Breakdown:** The Peacemakers, The Cleanup & Industrial Push, The Hayseed-Progressive Clash, WWI Neutrality & Concord, The Crisis
- **Key Narrative Tensions:** Detailed analysis of each pairing's political dynamics

### Key Narrative Patterns

**1. California as "The Adult in the Room"**
- California presidents consistently act as mediators, trade partners, and pragmatic problem-solvers while CSA and USA fight over ghosts.
- **Narrative Hook:** "We don't care who was right. We care who's still rich."

**2. Gentry vs. Hayseed Cycles**
- CSA political cycles between Gentry (pro-trade, sound money) and Hayseed (protectionist, debt relief) presidencies
- These cycles affect trade relationships with both USA and California

**3. The Toombs Act Disaster**
- Robert Toombs (CSA, 1867-1871) re-opens African slave trade
- Creates global boycott, affects all three nations' relationships
- Becomes the defining political disaster of the post-war era

## VI. VOTER SPECTRUM AND KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES (1939 SNAPSHOT)

### United States (North)

**Constitutional Unity Party (CUP):** Center-right, patriotic, "tough on CSA/California."
- **Voter Base:** Veterans, factory owners, Eastern urbanites, Western ranchers
- **Kitchen Table Issues:** High tariffs protect jobs, strong borders vs. CSA, big navy, honor the dead

**National Union Party (NUP):** Center-left, pragmatic, "pro-trade/pro-peace."
- **Voter Base:** Labor unions, farmers, immigrants, Pacific traders
- **Kitchen Table Issues:** Open trade lowers prices, trade pacts for markets, reconciliation, move on

### Confederate States (South)

**States' Rights Democratic Party (SRDP):** Center-right, traditionalist, "old South" core.
- **Voter Base:** Planters, small farmers, Southern urbanites
- **Kitchen Table Issues:** Protect farms, low taxes, traditional values, wary of North

**Populist–Labor Alliance (PLA):** Center-left, reformist.
- **Voter Base:** Factory workers, poor whites, some freedmen in border states
- **Kitchen Table Issues:** More factories, fair wages, labor rights, unions, open trade

### Republic of California

**Pacific Republican Party (PRP):** Center-right, business-oriented.
- **Voter Base:** Merchants, oil men, immigrants
- **Kitchen Table Issues:** Open trade, low taxes, business first, get rich quick

**Coastal Progressive League (CPL):** Center-left, reformist.
- **Voter Base:** Workers, intellectuals
- **Kitchen Table Issues:** Regulated growth, labor rights, fair for everyone, protected rights

## VII. TREATY OF CINCINNATI

### **PERMANENT LOCK - NO CHANGES ALLOWED**

**Signed:** 31 March 1865  
**Status:** The ugliest possible peace

No victory parades.  
No moral triumph.  
Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt  
and agreeing to pretend the other one exists  
while the continent quietly bleeds out.

That's the treaty that ends the war  
and starts the next seventy-six years of resentment.

### The Articles

| Article | Exact Term (Verbatim Where Possible) | Real-World Justification |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **1. Recognition** | The United States recognises the Confederate States of America as a sovereign and independent nation. | McClellan's campaign promise – no choice after 1864 election |
| **2. Borders** | CSA consists of: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas. Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line. | Locks in 11 seceded states + Tennessee (fell 1862). No further expansion |
| **3. Border States** | Kentucky and Missouri remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River. Maryland remains U.S. **West Virginia stays a U.S. state** – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States." | Prevents immediate second war; Kentucky/Missouri too divided to force. West Virginia sent 32,000 men to Union army; forcing reunion is political suicide. CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right they claimed. |
| **4. Indian Territory** | All pre-war treaties reaffirmed. Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognised as sovereign republics under joint U.S.–CSA protection. | Turns Native nations into buffer states – neither side can afford to restart removal |
| **5. Washington D.C.** | Remains U.S. capital but demilitarised except for ceremonial guard. CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy. | Prevents CSA from claiming the old capital; keeps symbolic continuity |
| **6. Slavery** | Status quo ante bellum – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S. No extradition of fugitive slaves across the new border. | McClellan's "peace without emancipation" platform |
| **7. Reparations** | None. Mutual release of all claims and debts. | Both treasuries are bankrupt |
| **8. Trade** | Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years. No discriminatory tariffs. **NOTE:** North violates this with punitive tariffs (300%) after Toombs Act re-opens African trade. | Keeps the continent economically linked (in theory). In practice, North suspends Article 8 unilaterally while African trade exists. |
| **9. Military** | Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months. No fortifications within 20 miles of the border. | Prevents immediate rematch |
| **10. Ratification** | Effective immediately upon signature. No amendments without mutual consent. | McClellan needs peace now |

### Key Provisions Summary

**Recognition:**
- United States formally recognizes Confederate States of America as sovereign and independent
- No choice after McClellan's 1864 election on peace platform

**Borders:**
- CSA consists of: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas
- Western boundary: 100th meridian from Texas panhandle north to Indian Territory line
- Locks in the 11 seceded states plus Tennessee (which fell in 1862)

**Border States:**
- Kentucky and Missouri: Remain U.S. states but neutral – no permanent garrisons by either side within 50 miles of the Ohio River
- Maryland: Remains U.S.
- West Virginia: Stays a U.S. state – "The State of West Virginia, as admitted to the Union in 1863, shall remain part of the United States"
- Why West Virginia stays U.S.: West Virginia sent 32,000 men to the Union army. Handing them back to the CSA is political suicide in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the entire North. The CSA's "states' rights" argument prevents them from denying West Virginia the same right they claimed for themselves.

**Indian Territory:**
- All pre-war treaties reaffirmed
- Five Civilized Tribes + Plains nations recognized as sovereign republics under joint U.S.–CSA protection
- Turns Native nations into buffer states – neither side can afford to restart removal

**Washington D.C.:**
- Remains U.S. capital but demilitarized except for ceremonial guard
- CSA granted perpetual right of transit and embassy

**Slavery:**
- Status quo ante bellum – legal in CSA, illegal in U.S.
- No extradition of fugitive slaves across the new border
- McClellan's "peace without emancipation" platform

**Reparations:**
- None. Mutual release of all claims and debts.
- Both treasuries are bankrupt

**Trade:**
- Most-favoured-nation status for 20 years
- No discriminatory tariffs
- In practice: North violates Article 8 with punitive tariffs (300%) after Toombs Act re-opens African trade

**Military:**
- Armies reduced to 25,000 each within 18 months
- No fortifications within 20 miles of the border

**Ratification:**
- Effective immediately upon signature
- No amendments without mutual consent

### The Result

The Treaty of Cincinnati is the ugliest possible peace:
- No victory parades
- No moral triumph
- Just two exhausted nations drawing a line in the dirt
- Agreeing to pretend the other one exists
- While the continent quietly bleeds out

That's the treaty that ends the war and starts the next seventy-six years of resentment.
