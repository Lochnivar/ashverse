## The Fire (1878 – 1894) – The Sustained Burn

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|

## The Embers (1895 – 1905) – Flickering Out

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1894–1905 | "Zombie decade" – slavery legally lingers on paper |
| 1896–1901 | **The Hayseed-Progressive Clash** – A Confederate populist and a Northern progressive want different kinds of reform while both nations suffer from protectionism. |
| 1896–1905 | **Cuba Mirror Effect** – Six-year drip of images forces CSA to see Weyler's camps as mirror of own past (LOCKED CANON - see `world-building/timelines/cuba-mirror-effect-timeline.md`) |

| 1893–1898 | **Hawaii Overthrow** – American planters overthrow Queen Liliʻuokalani (1893), Republic of Hawaii declared (1894). U.S. too weak to annex (no Spanish-American War). Japan circles (ASSERTED - see `world-building/timelines/hawaii-timeline.md`) |
| 1905–1915 | **Hawaii Under Japanese Protection** – Japan makes move: quiet protectorate → full annexation. Hawaii becomes Japanese territory. Pearl Harbor becomes Japanese fleet anchorage (ASSERTED - 9/10 likelihood) |
| 1914–1917 | **The WWI Neutrality** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president and a neutral Northern president try to stay out of a European war while both know they can't. |
| 1914–1919 | European War (WWI analogue) – starts on schedule (July-August 1914), lasts longer (5 years vs 4), ends in exhaustion stalemate. No U.S. entry in 1917 – fractured U.S. has no army/money/political will (ASSERTED - see `world-building/timelines/wwi-timeline.md`) |

## The Ashes (1920 – 1939) – Living in the Aftermath

| Period | Key events |
|--------|------------|
| 1920–1921 | **The Handoff** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president takes office as a war-weary Northern president finishes his term, both exhausted by a war they didn't want. |
| 1920s | **California Civil Rights Legislation** – Anti-discrimination in employment/housing ("Can't afford to waste talent on stupid prejudices") |
| 1921–1926 | **The Concord Cooperation** – A pro-trade Confederate Gentry president and a "return to normalcy" Northern president achieve peak cooperation while both know it's fragile. |
| 1926–1929 | **The Trade War** – A protectionist Confederate populist and a pro-trade Northern president watch the "Flickering Twenties" collapse into a trade war both helped create. |

| 1930s | Pacific tension rises (Japan, enabled by California oil) |

| Late 1930s | **USA Civil Rights Acts** – Easier passage without Southern bloc filibuster ("California's eating our lunch") |
| Late 1938 | Stalin manufactures border incidents, demands "security zones" in Poland/Baltics |
| Sep 1939 | **SOVIET ARMIES INVADE POLAND** – Kaiserreich Germany declares war. Europe erupts. |
| Sep 1939 | Final scene: a Fairfax and a Haskell on opposite sides of the continent read the same headline |

**Note:** California has been independent since 1873. By 1920, it has been its own country for 47 years—the rich, smug, Pacific-facing youngest sibling who moved out early, didn't get involved in the family politics, and made it rich. By the time WW1 starts (1914), it has been independent for 41 years.

## Why 1939 Is the Perfect Cut-Off

### Moral & Thematic Symmetry
You began with the fire (1863). You end with the continent watching **the world** catch fire (1939). The reader closes the book knowing the ashes of 1861 were only the prologue.

### Narrative Closure Without Resolution
Slavery is legally dead (1905), raids are local embers, the super-states are sovereign, California has been independent since 1873, the triad is real but fragile. Nothing is "fixed." Everything is **poised**. The reader feels the next war coming the way you feel thunder in your bones.

### Historical Honesty
1939 is the last year the NTL can still feel like "our" history with different paint. After 1939 every butterfly is a hurricane. Stopping here keeps the alt-history **believable** instead of turning into 21st-century fan-fiction.

### The Nuclear Shadow (Post-1939 Projection)
The nuclear era (~1955-1960 first detonation) lies strictly beyond the page—an "aiming point" for where the world is heading, not in-series content. The series ends in 1939; nuclear weapons are projection, not canon.

**See:** `world-building/military/european-war-1939-trigger.md` for post-1939 projections.

## The Final Image of The Ashes (1939)

A Fairfax (now in his 70s, living on the Sequoyah lease-land that is no longer his) and a Haskell (U.S. Navy captain, East Coast) stand on opposite sides of the continent reading the same newspaper headline:

**"SOVIET ARMIES INVADE POLAND – EUROPE AT WAR"**

**Visual details (subtle integration markers):**
- Fairfax's Cherokee neighbor checking the same headline
- Haskell's executive officer (Black or Jewish) coordinating mobilization orders
- NOT stated explicitly – just there, showing integration happened naturally

**Optional Fourth Perspective (Texas):**
A Texas ranger (independent nation, pragmatic) reading same headline:
"Glad we left when we did, but glad we came back when it mattered."

**Final image:** Encrypted cables racing between San Francisco, Richmond, Washington, Austin, and Tokyo. Oil tankers steaming east. Carrier groups mobilizing. The Concord and its Pacific ally reaching for the Big Stick.

They each think the same thought, in different accents:

**"We thought our war was the big one."**

Fade to black.

1863–1939.  
Six books.  
Four nations (USA, CSA, California, Texas).  
One continent.  
From the match that lit America to the ashes that are about to consume the world.

No epilogue needed.

The reader knows what comes next and knows the continent will never be ready.

That's not an ending.

That's a **warning**.
