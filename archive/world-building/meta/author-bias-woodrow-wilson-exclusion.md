---

## RATIONALE

**Author Judgment:** The author considers Wilson toxic as a president and has made the intentional decision to exclude him from the NTL.

**This is author bias, explicitly acknowledged.**

**No Wilson analogues or substitutes will be used.**

---

## IMPLICATIONS

**WWI Timeline:**
- No "Wilson-style moral diplomacy" in 1914
- No American president with Wilson's clout to mediate European crises
- Makes war more likely (as documented in `wwi-timeline.md`)

**Presidential Timeline:**
- Wilson will not appear in any USA presidential timeline
- No Wilson-type characters or analogues
- Other progressive/idealist figures may be used, but not Wilson

**Historical Figures:**
- Wilson is excluded from all NTL political roles
- This is an intentional authorial choice, not a historical necessity

---

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT

**This exclusion is:**
- Intentional
- Acknowledged as author bias
- Not a historical necessity
- A deliberate authorial choice

**The author has the right to exclude historical figures they consider toxic or problematic.**

## SNARK NOTE

**Even Dr. Gen. Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood thinks the guy's an overblown jerk. And that's saying something.**

*(Meta-textual note: If the in-universe satirical academic who writes footnotes about the Meade family's "cavalier disregard" for genealogical accuracy thinks Wilson is an overblown jerk, you know it's bad.)*

## LOCKED REVISION: DR. GEN. FAIRFAX-LOCKWOOD ON WILSON

**✅ LOCKED CANON:** From the private journal of Dr. General Michael J. Fairfax-Lockwood, Hoyt, Sequoyah, 1923  
(published in the 1985 compendium footnotes, p. 412)

> "Certain Northern journals still speak of Professor Woodrow Wilson as though he were a statesman of note.  
> 
> I have read his published lectures on 'self-determination of nations' and his curious pamphlet advocating a permanent congress of powers — ideas he circulated in the late teens, if memory serves.  
> 
> I am obliged to observe that I have seldom encountered a more perfect specimen of that peculiar Yankee vice: the belief that the world's ills may be cured by sufficiently eloquent moral posturing.  
> 
> The man appears to think that history is a debating society and that mankind is improved by being lectured at length by a Virginian who affects to have discovered virtue only after moving to New Jersey.  
> 
> In short, Mr. Wilson is the only living soul for whom I harbour a more profound contempt than I do for the average Boston abolitionist — and that, sir, is a distinction I had not thought possible.  
> 
> I have instructed my heirs that, should any monument to this gentleman ever be erected within the bounds of Sequoyah, it is to be quietly demolished and the marble reused for hitching posts."

**Footnote 47 (same page):**  
"The present writer considers Mr. Wilson's proposed 'league of nations' the most amusing flight of academic fancy since the phlogiston theory. One awaits with interest the day California is asked to submit its trade policy to a committee chaired by a Belgian."

## NTL ACCURATE VERSION

**Wilson's Status in NTL:**
- Wilson exists in the NTL, but is **just a pompous Princeton professor**
- Writes the 1920 equivalent of a Substack that everyone on the continent quietly uses for kindling
- No Fourteen Points
- No League of Nations
- No presidency, no cabinet positions, no significant political roles
- Just academic writings that nobody takes seriously

**Fairfax-Lockwood's Contempt:**
- Legendary and hilarious
- Perfect example of the character's dry, sardonic, aristocratic voice
- The fact that he considers Wilson worse than "the average Boston abolitionist" is a distinction he "had not thought possible"
- The marble monument/hitching post line is pure Fairfax-Lockwood venom

**The Timeline:**
- Wilson's still a prick
- Fairfax-Lockwood's contempt is still legendary
- And the timeline stays exactly as canon as the Bear Flag
