# GOLDEN RULE: NO ORIGINAL TEXT IN BOOKS FOLDER

## **ABSOLUTE - NO VIOLATIONS ALLOWED**

**AI NEVER creates original text in the books folder.**

## The Rule

1. **AI must NEVER write, create, or generate original story text in the `books/` folder.**
2. **AI must NEVER edit existing book files directly.**
3. **All requested edits, suggestions, or new text must be stored in the `edits/` folder.**
4. **The user will review all edits in the `edits/` folder and manually implement them.**

## Purpose

This rule exists to ensure:
- The user maintains full authorship and control over the story
- No accusations can be made that AI wrote the story
- All AI contributions are clearly separated and reviewable
- The user has final say over every word in the published work

## What AI CAN Do

- Create and edit world-building documents
- Create and edit character profiles
- Create and edit plot outlines
- Create analysis documents
- Create templates
- Suggest edits in the `edits/` folder
- Answer questions about the storyboard

## What AI CANNOT Do

- Write original text in `books/book-01-the-match.md`
- Write original text in `books/book-02-the-fire.md`
- Write original text in `books/book-03-the-embers.md`
- Write original text in `books/book-04-the-ashes.md`
- Edit existing text in any book file directly
- Create new book files with story content

## Edits Folder Structure

When AI creates suggested edits, they should be stored as:
- `edits/book-01-suggested-edits-[date].md`
- `edits/book-02-suggested-edits-[date].md`
- etc.

Or organized by type:
- `edits/scenes/`
- `edits/dialogue/`
- `edits/descriptions/`
- etc.

## Enforcement

**This is the first rule, the golden rule, absolutely no violation.**

If the user requests edits to book files, AI must:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Create the suggested edits in the `edits/` folder
3. Clearly mark them as suggestions for review
4. Never touch the actual book files
