# California Oil Economics (1873-1939)

## **LOCKED CANON - PERIPHERY**

**Status:** LOCKED CANON  
**Scope:** Peripheral to main story, but explains California's economic power  
**Tone:** Pragmatic realpolitik, ruthlessly profitable

---

## The Core Reality

**Short Answer:** Yes, California can absolutely afford to be the Oprah of Pacific oil — **but only because it's not giving the oil away**.

It's selling it at full market price (plus a healthy California premium) and still coming out filthy rich.

## The Numbers (1873–1939)

### Resource Production and Export Capacity

| Resource | California's Position | Annual Export Capacity (1930s) | Who Pays | California's Margin |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Crude Oil** (Bakersfield, Long Beach, Signal Hill) | World's #2 producer after Texas (CSA) | ~350–400 k barrels/day | Japan, Pacific Alliance, China, Europe | 25–40% profit after costs |
| **Refined Products** (Richmond, El Segundo refineries) | Largest refining center outside Gulf Coast | ~500 k barrels/day refined | Same customers | 35–50% profit |
| **Coaling / Bunkering Stations** | Owns every major port from San Diego to Bearfort | Unlimited while oil flows | Every navy/merchant fleet | Pure profit on infrastructure |

## The "Oprah" Moment in Practice

When California says "You get some oil!", what it actually means:

### Japan (45-55% of Japan's imported oil)
- **Supply:** 45-55% of Japan's imported oil
- **Price:** Market + 15-20% premium ("friendly rates")
- **Volume:** ~350-400 k barrels/day
- **Margin:** 25-40% profit after costs
- **Result:** Japan gets oil, California gets rich

### Pacific Alliance (Oregon/WA - Priority Delivery)
- **Supply:** Priority delivery (family discount)
- **Price:** Market + 5% premium (the "family discount")
- **Volume:** Significant portion of Pacific Alliance needs
- **Margin:** Still profitable, but lower margin
- **Result:** Pacific Alliance gets oil, California maintains control

### China, Netherlands East Indies, Random Neutrals
- **Supply:** Available, but not priority
- **Price:** Market + 30% premium (cash on delivery)
- **Volume:** Whatever's left after Japan and Pacific Alliance
- **Margin:** Highest margin (premium pricing)
- **Result:** Everyone gets oil, California gets richest

**The Reality:**
California isn't handing out free oil.  
It's running the **Pacific OPEC** with a smile and a surcharge.

## Can California Afford It?

### Revenue from Oil & Trade (1935)

| Year | Revenue from Oil & Trade | Rough 2025-equivalent | Enough to… |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| **1935** | ~$900 million USD | ~$22 billion | Bankroll the entire Pacific Alliance navy **and** the Concord summits **and** still have cash left over for another world's fair |

**The Math:**
- California produces ~350-400 k barrels/day
- At market price + premium (15-30% depending on customer)
- 25-50% profit margin after costs
- Annual revenue: ~$900 million USD (1935)
- 2025-equivalent: ~$22 billion

**What California Can Afford:**
- Bankroll the entire Pacific Alliance navy
- Fund the American Concord summits
- Still have cash left over for another world's fair
- And still be filthy rich

## The Pricing Structure

### Tier 1: Japan (45-55% of Japan's imported oil)
- **Price:** Market + 15-20% premium ("friendly rates")
- **Volume:** ~350-400 k barrels/day
- **Margin:** 25-40% profit after costs
- **Why:** Japan is California's biggest customer, but California still profits massively

### Tier 2: Pacific Alliance (Oregon/WA - Priority Delivery)
- **Price:** Market + 5% premium (the "family discount")
- **Volume:** Significant portion of Pacific Alliance needs
- **Margin:** Still profitable, but lower margin
- **Why:** Family discount, but still profitable

### Tier 3: China, Netherlands East Indies, Random Neutrals
- **Price:** Market + 30% premium (cash on delivery)
- **Volume:** Whatever's left after Japan and Pacific Alliance
- **Margin:** Highest margin (premium pricing)
- **Why:** Premium pricing for non-priority customers

---

## Why Customers Keep Coming

**The Alternative:**
- Buy from the CSA (who hate Japan) → unreliable, hostile
- Buy from the U.S. (who can't guarantee delivery) → unreliable, fractured
- Buy from California → reliable, available, profitable (for California)

**The Reality:**
- California is the only reliable supplier in the Pacific
- California has the infrastructure (ports, refineries, bunkering stations)
- California has the production capacity (world's #2 producer)
- California has the pricing (premium, but available)

**The Result:**
- Customers keep lining up
- California keeps profiting
- Everyone wins (but California wins more)

---

## The "Charity with Interest Rates" Philosophy

**It's not charity.**  
**It's charity with interest rates.**

**What It Means:**
- California provides oil to everyone
- But everyone pays premium prices
- California profits massively
- But customers still benefit (reliable supply)

**The Most California Thing Imaginable:**
- Generous (provides oil to everyone)
- Profitable (premium pricing, high margins)
- Pragmatic (not charity, but business)
- Win-win (customers get oil, California gets rich)

---

## The Economic Power

### California's Oil Revenue (1935)
- **Annual Revenue:** ~$900 million USD
- **2025-equivalent:** ~$22 billion
- **Profit Margin:** 25-50% (depending on customer)
- **Net Profit:** ~$225-450 million USD (1935)
- **2025-equivalent:** ~$5.5-11 billion

### What California Can Afford
- **Pacific Alliance Navy:** Bankrolled by California
- **American Concord Summits:** Funded by California
- **World's Fairs:** Cash left over for another world's fair
- **And Still Be Filthy Rich:** California has massive reserves

## The Long Game

**California isn't just selling oil today.**  
**It's buying the future with every barrel.**

**See:** `california-oil-long-game-strategy-1873-1955.md` for the full strategic vision.

**The Short Version:**
- Oil revenue funds permanent infrastructure (ports, cables, merchant marine, land, treaty ports)
- When oil runs out (1955), California doesn't panic
- Infrastructure is permanent (outlives the oil)
- California controls the Pacific (even after oil runs out)
- The rest of the Pacific is still paying tuition

**The oil was never the endgame.**  
**It was the entry fee.**
