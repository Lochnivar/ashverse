## 1. OTL EVENTS ANALYSIS - LOCKED CANON

### Documents Created/Updated:

1. **`edits/otl-events-analysis-pod-to-war-end-2025-12-05.md`**
   - Initial analysis of OTL events from PoD to war end
   - Status: Analysis complete

2. **`edits/otl-events-verification-analysis-2025-12-05.md`**
   - Verification of user's list against established canon
   - Status: ✅ APPROVED - 93% plausibility verified

3. **`world-building/reference/otl-events-never-happen.md`**
   - Comprehensive reference document
   - Status: ✅ LOCKED CANON

### Key Assertions:

**Category 1 (Definitely Never Happen - 95-100%):**
- Gettysburg Days 2-3, Overland Campaign, Siege of Petersburg, Sherman's March to the Sea, Lincoln's re-election, 13th Amendment, etc.

**Category 2 (Likely Still Happen - 75-90%):**
- Vicksburg surrender, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Grant's Western promotion, New York Draft Riots (worse)

**Category 3 (Uncertain/Different - 75-90%):**
- Atlanta Campaign (different outcome), Hood replaces Johnston (different reason)

**Category 4 (Explicitly Different/New NTL Events):**
- Sherman's March to Appomattox, Grant surrenders, etc.

## 2. ATLANTA CAMPAIGN NTL TIMELINE - LOCKED CANON

### Document Created:

**`edits/atlanta-campaign-ntl-timeline-2025-12-05.md`**
- Status: ✅ LOCKED CANON
- Plausibility: 87%

### Key Assertions:

- **May 1864:** Sherman begins advance from Chattanooga (same as OTL)
- **June-July 1864:** Sherman advances, Johnston retreats (similar to OTL)
- **July 17, 1864:** Hood replaces Johnston (CSA seizes opportunity - Eastern success creates momentum, need aggressive action in West)
- **August-November 1864:** Siege of Atlanta (Sherman reaches suburbs, Hood defends - 4 months siege, never falls)
- **January 1865:** Sherman withdraws (peace negotiations beginning)

**Result:** Atlanta besieged but never falls. Ambiguous outcome - neither side wins decisively.

**Critical Correction:** Hood replacement is about **seizing opportunity** (CSA star ascendant after Pickett Raid and Hancock wounded), NOT desperation.

## 3. SHERMAN'S MARCH TO APPOMATTOX - LOCKED CANON

### Document Created:

**`edits/sherman-march-to-appomattox-option-c-modified-2025-12-05.md`**
- Status: ✅ LOCKED CANON
- Plausibility: 94%

### Key Assertions:

- **January 25, 1865:** Sherman receives Grant's telegram
- **January 29, 1865:** Sherman begins march (48k men, 550 miles)
- **Week 1 (Jan 29-Feb 5):** Georgia foothills - 18-20 mi/day (optimistic)
- **Week 2 (Feb 6-12):** Tennessee mountains - 12-15 mi/day (concerned)
- **Week 3 (Feb 13-19):** Virginia mountains - 8-10 mi/day (desperate)
- **February 17, 1865:** Sherman realizes he won't make it in time
- **February 20, 1865:** Grant surrenders (Sherman still 180 miles away)
- **February 21, 1865:** Sherman learns of Grant's defeat (1,900 casualties for nothing)
- **February 22, 1865:** Longstreet grants safe passage (honors word to Grant)

**Result:** Weather defeats Sherman, not Confederate military. Post-war mythology: "The March That Couldn't Beat Winter."

## RULES REVIEW AND UPDATES

### Updated "DO NOT" Rules (canon-refresher-for-ai.md):

**Added:**
11. **DO NOT** assume OTL events still happen - check `world-building/reference/otl-events-never-happen.md` for comprehensive list
12. **DO NOT** assume Grant becomes general-in-chief - he never gets promoted (no Gettysburg victory)
13. **DO NOT** assume Atlanta falls - it's besieged but never falls (Sherman withdraws January 1865)
14. **DO NOT** assume Sherman's March to the Sea happens - war ends before it can happen
15. **DO NOT** assume Hancock's wounding is a CSA setback - it's a CSA victory (Pickett Raid successful, Hancock wounded)

### Process Rules (Verified Current):
- ✅ Golden Rule: No editing `books/` folder
- ✅ Plausibility Gate: 70% threshold
- ✅ Honesty Rule: Don't make things up
- ✅ Proactive Refresh Reminder: Still active
