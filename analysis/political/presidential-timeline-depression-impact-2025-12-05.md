# Presidential Timeline: Impact of Different Type of Crisis (1929-1935)

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Purpose:** Analyze how the locked "Different Type of Crisis" (1929-1935, timing flexible) affects the recommended presidential timeline

**BASED ON LOCKED CANON:**
- **Great Depression Outcome:** Different Type of Crisis (Option 1) - LOCKED
- **Timing:** 1929-1935 (FLEXIBLE - not locked)
- **Mechanism:** Different triggers by nation - USA (smaller bubble burst), CSA (trade collapse), California (oil price collapse)
- **Partial Roaring 20s Basis:** USA "Flickering Twenties" (1921-1928), CSA moderate boom (1923-1930), California continuous growth (1919-1929)

## PRESIDENTS IN OFFICE DURING CRISIS (1929-1935)

### Current Presidential Timeline (1929-1935)

| Term | President | Party | Status |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **1929-1933** | Herbert Hoover analogue (Charles Curtis) | Constitutional Unity | Elected 1928, takes Depression blame |
| **1933-1939+** | Franklin Delano Wynkoop (FDR analogue) | National Union | Elected 1932, 1936 - New Deal, Economic Concord, recovery |

## ANALYSIS: HOW "DIFFERENT TYPE OF CRISIS" AFFECTS PRESIDENTS

### Key Differences from OTL Great Depression

**OTL Great Depression:**
- Unified crisis (one nation, one bubble, one crash)
- Clear "blame the president" narrative (Hoover gets blamed, FDR gets credit)
- Dramatic stock market crash (Black Tuesday 1929)
- Unified response (New Deal)

**NTL "Different Type of Crisis":**
- Three separate crises (USA, CSA, California)
- No unified speculative bubble (USA "Flickering", CSA moderate, California continuous)
- Different triggers by nation (USA: smaller bubble burst, CSA: trade collapse, California: oil price collapse)
- Less synchronized (three separate crises, not one unified depression)
- Less severe overall (no unified bubble, USA already "flickering")
- Three separate responses (no unified New Deal)

## IMPACT ON HOOVER ANALOGUE (1929-1933)

### OTL Narrative:
- **Hoover:** Gets blamed for the Great Depression
- **Mechanism:** Stock market crash happens on his watch, he's seen as doing too little
- **Result:** Loses 1932 election in landslide, becomes symbol of failure

### NTL Narrative (Different Type of Crisis):

**What Changes:**
- **Less dramatic crisis:** No unified speculative bubble to burst dramatically
- **USA already "flickering":** Factories already half-idle, so crisis is less dramatic
- **Smaller bubble burst:** USA stock market crash is smaller (no unified bubble)
- **Less blame:** Crisis is less dramatic, so less "blame the president" narrative
- **But still blamed:** Economic crisis still happens, president still gets blamed

**Revised Assessment:**
- **Still loses 1932 election:** Economic crisis still happens, voters still blame president
- **But less dramatic:** Crisis is less severe, so blame is less intense
- **Plausibility:** 86% stands - still gets blamed, but narrative is less dramatic

**Potential Adjustments:**
- **Timing flexibility:** If crisis starts later (1930-1931 instead of 1929), Hoover might serve longer before crisis hits
- **Blame narrative:** Less "Hoover caused it" and more "Hoover didn't prevent it"
- **Election timing:** 1932 election still happens, but might be less of a landslide if crisis is less severe

## IMPACT ON FDR ANALOGUE (1933-1939+)

### OTL Narrative:
- **FDR:** Wins 1932 election, implements New Deal, gets credit for recovery
- **Mechanism:** Unified response (New Deal) to unified crisis
- **Result:** Wins 1936 election, becomes symbol of recovery

### NTL Narrative (Different Type of Crisis):

**What Changes:**
- **No unified New Deal:** Three separate responses, not one unified program
- **Different triggers:** USA (smaller bubble burst), CSA (trade collapse), California (oil price collapse)
- **Less severe crisis:** USA already "flickering", so recovery is less dramatic
- **Three separate responses:** Each nation responds differently

**Revised Assessment:**
- **Still wins 1932 election:** Economic crisis still happens, voters want change
- **But different response:** Not unified "New Deal" but separate responses per nation
- **Less dramatic recovery:** Crisis is less severe, so recovery is less dramatic
- **Plausibility:** 89% stands - still wins, but narrative is different

**Potential Adjustments:**
- **Response type:** Not "New Deal" but "Economic Concord" or separate programs
- **Recovery narrative:** Less dramatic recovery, more gradual improvement
- **Election timing:** 1936 election still happens, but might be less of a landslide if recovery is less dramatic

## TIMING FLEXIBILITY IMPACT

### If Crisis Starts Earlier (1929):
- **Hoover analogue:** Takes office 1929, crisis hits immediately
- **Blame narrative:** Stronger (crisis happens on his watch)
- **1932 election:** More dramatic (crisis has been going on for 3 years)

### If Crisis Starts Later (1930-1931):
- **Hoover analogue:** Takes office 1929, has 1-2 years before crisis hits
- **Blame narrative:** Weaker (crisis doesn't happen immediately)
- **1932 election:** Less dramatic (crisis has been going on for 1-2 years)

### If Crisis Starts Much Later (1932-1933):
- **Hoover analogue:** Might serve full term before crisis hits
- **Blame narrative:** Much weaker (crisis hits after he leaves office)
- **1932 election:** Less dramatic (crisis hasn't started yet)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Keep Current Timeline (Recommended)
- **Hoover analogue (1929-1933):** Still gets blamed, but less dramatically
- **FDR analogue (1933-1939+):** Still wins, but implements different response
- **Timing:** Keep flexible (1929-1935), but assume crisis starts 1929-1930

**Rationale:**
- Current timeline works with "Different Type of Crisis"
- Less dramatic crisis = less dramatic blame/recovery, but still plausible
- Timing flexibility allows adjustment if needed

### 2. Adjust Blame Narrative
- **Less "Hoover caused it":** More "Hoover didn't prevent it"
- **Less dramatic:** Crisis is less severe, so blame is less intense
- **Still loses:** Economic crisis still happens, voters still want change

### 3. Adjust Response Narrative
- **Not "New Deal":** But "Economic Concord" or separate programs
- **Less dramatic recovery:** Crisis is less severe, so recovery is less dramatic
- **Still wins 1936:** Recovery still happens, voters still credit president

## KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Current timeline works:** Hoover analogue (1929-1933) and FDR analogue (1933-1939+) still make sense with "Different Type of Crisis"

2. **Less dramatic narrative:** Crisis is less severe, so blame/recovery narratives are less dramatic, but still plausible

3. **Timing flexibility helps:** If crisis starts later, blame narrative is weaker, but timeline still works

4. **Response type changes:** Not unified "New Deal" but separate responses per nation

5. **Plausibility scores stand:** 86% (Hoover) and 89% (FDR) still accurate - less dramatic but still plausible

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Current presidential timeline is compatible with "Different Type of Crisis":**

- **Hoover analogue (1929-1933):** Still gets blamed, but less dramatically (86% plausibility stands)
- **FDR analogue (1933-1939+):** Still wins, but implements different response (89% plausibility stands)
- **Timing flexibility:** Allows adjustment if crisis starts later, but current timeline works

**No major changes needed** - current timeline works with "Different Type of Crisis" outcome.

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Verdict:** Current presidential timeline compatible with "Different Type of Crisis"  
**Recommendation:** Keep current timeline, adjust narratives to reflect less dramatic crisis
