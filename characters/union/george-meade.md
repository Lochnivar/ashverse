## Casting Reference

### Primary Choice
**Richard Anderson (Gettysburg, 1993)**
- **Peak Era:** Gettysburg (1993)
- **Why He's Perfect:** He already played the role. Keep him. Let him come back thirty years later with the light gone out behind the spectacles.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The moment he finally issues the pursuit order at 4 p.m. on July 3 — Anderson's quiet "We move at dawn… no, now" that comes six hours too late.

### Alternative Choices

**Alan Rickman (if alive)**
- **Peak Era:** 1990-2010 (Die Hard, Robin Hood, Harry Potter)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The voice of exhausted, hyper-intelligent anxiety. Rickman could make "I won't waste lives on a hunch" sound like a funeral bell.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The Hagerstown council of war — Rickman staring at the map, adjusting his glasses, knowing the perfect plan is already useless.

**Mark Rylance**
- **Peak Era:** 2015-2025 (Bridge of Spies, Dunkirk, The Trial of the Chicago 7)
- **Why He's Perfect:** Modern master of still, cerebral anguish. Rylance's Colonel Dax energy is Meade watching his own reputation die in real time.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The sacking scene — Rylance receiving the telegram from Washington, reading it once, folding it, and saying softly, "So that's that, then."

**David Strathairn**
- **Peak Era:** 2005-2020 (Good Night, and Good Luck, Lincoln)
- **Why He's Perfect:** The thinking man's anxious general. Strathairn's Lincoln-era gravitas + nervous eyes = Meade realizing the war just ended and he missed it.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** Burning the unmarked ace of spades every July 2 — no dialogue, just Strathairn's face doing the mourning for an entire nation.

**Tobias Menzies**
- **Peak Era:** 2014-2025 (Outlander, The Crown, Game of Thrones)
- **Why He's Perfect:** British precision married to quiet torment. Menzies's Prince Philip restraint would make Meade's caution feel like a death sentence.
- **Signature NTL Moment:** The exact moment he learns Hancock has been given his army — Menzies's tiny, involuntary flinch behind the glasses.
