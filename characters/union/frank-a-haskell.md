## Character Arc (NTL)

### Starting Point (1861-1863)
- Young officer, idealistic about war
- Believes in Union cause
- Ready to serve and fight

### Gettysburg (July 1-2, 1863)
- Witnesses Lee's death
- Sees Longstreet's withdrawal
- Records events in detail
- Begins to understand war's complexity

### The Collapse (1863-1865)
- Watches Northern will crumble
- Sees failures accumulate
- Records everything
- Struggles with meaning

### The End (February-March 1865)
- Witnesses Grant's final gamble
- Sees surrender at Appomattox
- Records the end
- Must find meaning in defeat

### Post-War (1865+)
- Lives with memories
- Establishes family
- Passes on witness tradition
- Creates legacy

## Voice & Dialogue

### Speech Patterns
- **Precise** - Uses exact words, specific details
- **Observant** - Comments on what he sees
- **Thoughtful** - Thinks before speaking
- **Sometimes Cynical** - Sees reality without romanticizing

### Vocabulary
- Educated, but accessible
- Military terminology when appropriate
- Uses specific details, names, dates
- Avoids abstractions, prefers concrete observations

### Sample Dialogue
- "We're marching to our own funeral, but we're marching."
- "I record what I see. The truth matters, even when it hurts."
- "The end came not with thunder, but with silence."
- "We thought our war was the big one. We were wrong."

## Narrative Notes

### Avoiding Caricature
- **Not Just a Witness** - Active participant, not passive observer
- **Not a Hero** - Competent officer, not legendary figure
- **Not a Martyr** - Survives, must live with memories
- **Not Perfect** - Has flaws, makes mistakes, judges harshly

### Key Contradictions
- **Idealistic but Realistic** - Believes in cause but sees its flaws
- **Participant but Observer** - Fights but also records
- **Survives but Struggles** - Lives but carries weight
- **Records but Questions** - Writes everything but wonders if it matters

### Writing Tips
- Use his writing as narrative device - letters, journals, reports
- Show his observation skills through specific details
- Contrast his idealism with war's reality
- Use his survival as burden, not blessing
- Let his cynicism emerge gradually

## Casting Reference

### Best Actual Portrayal
**No film portrayal** - Haskell has never been portrayed in a major Civil War film

### Actor Archetype Suggestions

| Actor | Peak Era | Why He's Perfect for NTL Haskell | Signature NTL Moment |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Ethan Hawke** | 2010-2025 (*First Reformed*, *The Northman*, *Blaze*) | The single best living actor who can play a man whose soul has been hollowed out by observation. Hawke's pastor in *First Reformed* is already 95% NTL Haskell: quiet, precise, writing everything down because if he stops writing he'll have to feel it. | The Cold Harbor vigil scene—Hawke sitting motionless at a desk for three straight minutes of screen time, pen in hand, eyes fixed on the blank page while the camera slowly pushes in. No dialogue. Just the sound of his breathing getting shallower. |
| **James McAvoy** | 2005-2015 (*Atonement*, *Filth*, *Split*) | The best younger choice. McAvoy has the lean intensity, the hyper-observant eyes, and the ability to play a man who is simultaneously brave and emotionally flayed. His performance in *Atonement* as the officer who sees too much is basically Haskell at Gettysburg. | Writing by candlelight in March 1865: "The end came not with thunder, but with silence." McAvoy's soft Scottish lilt turned Midwestern would make the line sound like a death sentence. |
| **Jeremy Irons** (older version) | 1990-2010 (*Reversal of Fortune*, *Margin Call*) | For the post-war Haskell. Irons's voice is literally made of ash and regret. He could read Haskell's journals in voice-over and make you believe the Union died of shame. | The moment he watches the Treaty of Cincinnati being signed and quietly writes: "We thought our war was the big one. We were wrong." Irons could make that sentence end the world. |
| **Adam Driver** | 2015-2025 (*Marriage Story*, *Paterson*, *Silence*) | Driver's poet-soldier energy from *Paterson* and *Silence* is perfect for a man who records everything but can't stop it. His physicality—tall, angular, always slightly apart—matches Haskell's observer role. | The scene where he tries to explain to his wife why he has to keep writing even though no one will ever read it. Driver's cracked whisper would destroy the audience. |
| **Tom Holland** (wild-card youth version) | 2013-2019 (*The Impossible*, *Cherry*) | Only if we want to show Haskell at 35 in 1863. Holland has proven he can play intelligent, overwhelmed young men carrying unbearable weight. Give him a beard and twenty years of war and he becomes Haskell. | Gettysburg, July 1—Holland watching Lee fall from horseback, realizing in real time that everything just changed, and whispering "My God, it's over" before anyone else understands. |

### NTL-Specific Notes
- **The key difference:** In NTL, Haskell survives and becomes the family founder, not just a witness
- **The burden:** Observer who must live with what he sees and records
- **The writing:** His journals and letters become the record of a lost cause, the witness testimony
- **Physical presence:** Tall, lean, observant, always slightly apart - the witness who sees everything and must record it

---

**Status:** HISTORICAL FIGURE - ADAPTED FOR NTL  
**Plausibility:** 95% (survives due to different battle circumstances)  
**Source:** OTL historical record (Frank A. Haskell was real person), adapted for NTL divergence  
**Note:** In NTL, Haskell survives and becomes the founder of the Haskell witness family, providing the Northern perspective across generations.
