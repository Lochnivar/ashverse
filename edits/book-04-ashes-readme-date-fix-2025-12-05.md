# Suggested Fix: Book 4 README Date Correction

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**File:** `books/book-04-the-ashes/README.md`  
**Line:** 48  
**Issue:** California independence incorrectly listed as 1920 instead of 1873

## Current Text (INCORRECT):
```
- **California becomes fully independent Republic of California (1920)** - No longer even pretending to be U.S. territory. Rich, smug, Pacific superpower in all but name.
```

## Suggested Fix:
```
- **California becomes fully independent Republic of California (1873)** - No longer even pretending to be U.S. territory. Rich, smug, Pacific superpower in all but name.
```

## Context

This is part of the California consistency fixes. California independence is locked canon at 1872-1873:
- Great Native Toll War: Jan–May 1872
- Independence Referendum: 5 Nov 1872 (69% YES)
- Treaty of San Francisco signed: 14 Feb 1873
- Republic of California fully sovereign: 4 July 1873

The same README file correctly states "independent since 1873" and "47 years by 1920" elsewhere, so this appears to be a single-line error.

**Status:** SUGGESTED EDIT - Awaiting user review and manual implementation
