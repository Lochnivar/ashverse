## POSSIBLE NTL PATHS FOR GRANT

### **Path 1: Grant Stays in the West**

**Scenario:**
- Grant wins Vicksburg (July 1863)
- Continues Western operations (Chattanooga, Atlanta, etc.)
- Never called East (because Eastern theater is different)
- Remains Western theater commander through 1864-1865
- In March 1865, he's still in the West or available for transfer

**Plausibility:** 60%
- **Strengths:** Vicksburg happened, Grant was a Western general, no reason to call him East if Eastern theater is different
- **Weaknesses:** If Grant is the "most likely leader" for the final gamble, why isn't he already in the East? What would bring him East in March 1865?

**Questions:**
- Does Chattanooga still happen? (October 1863)
- Does Grant still get promoted to command all armies? (March 1864)
- If so, why isn't he in the East already?
- If not, why would he be called East in March 1865?

---

### **Path 2: Grant Called East Earlier (But Different Role)**

**Scenario:**
- Grant wins Vicksburg (July 1863)
- Called East after Meade's relief (August 1, 1863) or Warren's disaster (Hagerstown, late October 1863; Warren relieved January 1864)
- But doesn't get the same promotion/title as OTL
- Serves in different capacity (maybe as advisor, or subordinate commander)
- In March 1865, he's available for the final gamble

**Plausibility:** 50%
- **Strengths:** Explains why Grant is available in March 1865, why he might be "relieved" or acting "rogue"
- **Weaknesses:** Why wouldn't Grant get the same promotion if he's the best general? What would prevent it?

**Questions:**
- When is Grant called East? (After Meade? After Warren? After Hancock?)
- What role does he get? (Advisor? Subordinate? Overall command?)
- Why doesn't he get the same promotion as OTL?
- Why would he be "relieved" or acting "rogue" in March 1865?

---

### **Path 3: Grant Promoted But Eastern Theater Different**

**Scenario:**
- Grant wins Vicksburg (July 1863)
- Still gets promoted to command all armies (March 1864, like OTL)
- But Eastern theater is different (no Overland Campaign, different strategy)
- Grant tries different approach, fails or gets frustrated
- In March 1865, he's desperate for one last throw

**Plausibility:** 70%
- **Strengths:** Grant still gets recognition for Vicksburg, still promoted, but Eastern theater is different so his approach fails
- **Weaknesses:** If Grant is in overall command since March 1864, why is the war still going badly? Why would he wait until March 1865 for a desperate gamble?

**Questions:**
- Does Grant still get promoted March 1864?
- What does Grant do differently in the East? (No Overland Campaign, different strategy)
- Why does Grant's approach fail?
- Why does Grant wait until March 1865 for the desperate gamble?

---

### **Path 4: Grant Never Gets Overall Command (But Available for Final Gamble)**

**Scenario:**
- Grant wins Vicksburg (July 1863)
- Continues in West, but never gets overall command
- Eastern theater commanders (Meade, Warren, Hancock) handle the East
- By March 1865, all options exhausted, Grant is called East for final gamble
- Grant acts "rogue" because he's not officially in command, but takes charge anyway

**Plausibility:** 75%
- **Strengths:** Explains why Grant might be "relieved" or acting "rogue" - he's not officially in command, but takes charge anyway. Explains why he's available in March 1865.
- **Weaknesses:** Why wouldn't Grant get overall command if he's the best general? What would prevent it?

**Questions:**
- Why doesn't Grant get overall command? (Political? Different priorities? McClellan's influence?)
- What keeps Grant in the West?
- Why is Grant called East in March 1865? (Last resort? Desperation?)
- Why does Grant act "rogue"? (Not officially in command, but takes charge anyway?)

---

## RECOMMENDED PATH: Path 4 (Grant Never Gets Overall Command)

### **Rationale:**

1. **Vicksburg still happens** - Grant wins, but it's not enough to change the Eastern theater
2. **Eastern theater different** - Longstreet's withdrawal, Pennsylvania raid, different strategy needed
3. **Grant stays in West** - No reason to call him East if Eastern commanders (Meade, Warren, Hancock) are handling it
4. **Grant never gets overall command** - Maybe political (McClellan's influence?), maybe different priorities, maybe Grant's Western focus
5. **March 1865 desperation** - All Eastern options exhausted, Grant called East as last resort
6. **Grant acts "rogue"** - Not officially in command, but takes charge anyway for final gamble

### **Timeline:**

**July 4, 1863:** Grant wins Vicksburg ✅  
**July 1863 - March 1865:** Grant continues in Western theater (Chattanooga, Atlanta, etc.)  
**March 1865:** Grant called East as last resort, acts "rogue" for final gamble

### **Why This Works:**

- **Explains the "rogue action"** - Grant not officially in command, but takes charge anyway
- **Explains availability** - Grant available in March 1865 because he's called East as last resort
- **Explains desperation** - Grant knows this is his last chance, acts without official authority
- **Consistent with timeline** - Eastern commanders (Meade, Warren, Hancock) handle the East, Grant stays in West until desperation

## QUESTIONS FOR USER

1. **Does Grant still get promoted to command all armies?** (March 1864, like OTL)
   - If yes: Why isn't he in the East already? What does he do differently?
   - If no: Why not? What prevents it?

2. **What keeps Grant in the West?** (After Vicksburg, what does Grant do?)
   - Chattanooga? (October 1863)
   - Atlanta campaign? (1864)
   - Other Western operations?

3. **Why is Grant called East in March 1865?** (Last resort? Desperation?)
   - All Eastern options exhausted?
   - McClellan's administration desperate?
   - Grant volunteers?

4. **Why does Grant act "rogue"?** (Not officially in command, but takes charge anyway?)
   - Not officially in command?

## RECOMMENDED NTL PATH FOR GRANT

### **Grant's NTL Timeline (Proposed):**

**July 4, 1863:** Grant wins Vicksburg ✅  
**July 1863 - October 1863:** Grant continues Western operations (Chattanooga campaign)  
**October 1863:** Grant wins Chattanooga (if it still happens)  
**1864:** Grant continues in Western theater (maybe Atlanta campaign, or other operations)  
**March 1865:** Grant called East as last resort (all Eastern options exhausted)  
**March 29-31, 1865:** Grant's final gamble at Appomattox (acts "rogue" - not officially in command, but takes charge anyway)

### **Why Grant Acts "Rogue":**

- Grant not officially in command of Eastern theater
- McClellan's administration desperate, calls Grant East as last resort
- Grant takes charge without official authority, launches final gamble
- Grant knows this is his last chance, acts "rogue" for desperate throw

**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Recommendation:** Use Path 4 (Grant Never Gets Overall Command) as base, but need user confirmation on:
1. Does Grant get overall command? (March 1864)
2. What keeps Grant in the West? (After Vicksburg)
3. Why is Grant called East in March 1865? (Last resort?)
4. Why does Grant act "rogue"? (Not officially in command?)
