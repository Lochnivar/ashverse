# World War II in the NTL: Two Separate Wars

## The Critical Divergence

By 1939–1950 the planet is fighting **two almost completely separate wars** that only brush against each other at the edges.

## The Two Wars

| War | Years | Belligerents | Scope & character | Outcome (most likely) |
|-----|-------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **The European War** | 1939–1945 | Nazi Germany + satellites vs. Britain/France/Soviet Union (exact same as OTL) | Land/air war in Europe, Atlantic U-boat campaign, Eastern Front meat-grinder | Germany still loses 1944–45 (no second front relief needed; Soviets still steamroll) |
| **The Pacific War** | 1941–1949 | Imperial Japan vs. Britain/France/Dutch/Australia (and maybe China) | Naval/air war for colonies, no attack on U.S. or California soil | Japan wins limited victory or stalemate → keeps most of Southeast Asia |

## Why They Stay Disconnected

| Factor | OTL 1941 | NTL 1941–49 |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Oil supply for Japan | Cut off by U.S. embargo → Pearl Harbor | Supplied by independent California → no need to hit Pearl Harbor |
| U.S. entry trigger | Pearl Harbor + Hitler declares war | Neither happens → fractured U.S. stays neutral or "non-belligerent" |
| California position | U.S. state → automatically at war | Sovereign, rich, selling oil and movies to everyone |
| Soviet second front | Opens 1944 with D-Day | Never opens – no Western Allies in Europe |

## Realistic 1945–1950 Map

- **Europe:** exactly OTL 1945 (Soviets in Berlin, Cold War starts).
- **Pacific:** Japan controls Indonesia, Malaya, Indochina, Philippines, coastal China. Britain/France are kicked out of Asia.
- **California:** the **neutral banker** of the Pacific, richer than ever.
- **United States (East Coast version):** exhausted spectator with a tiny navy.

## Result

"World War Two" in the NTL is remembered as **two wars**:

1. The European War (1939–1945) – Hitler's war, ends in Berlin with Soviet tanks.
2. The Japanese War / Pacific War (1941–1949) – colonial scramble, ends in negotiated ceasefire or Japanese limited victory.

No Pearl Harbor.  
No D-Day.  
No Manhattan Project (or it's a tiny California sideshow).

Just two continents burning for different reasons while California sells popcorn and gasoline to both sides.
