## PROPOSED UPDATE TO CHAPTER BREAKDOWN

The current chapter breakdown in `books/book-01-the-match/README.md` needs to be updated to reflect the actual chapter structure:

### Current Breakdown (Lines 76-89):
```
## Chapter Breakdown
*(As a novella, this will be more focused and condensed than a full novel)*

1. Chapter 1: ~10:30 p.m., July 1, 1863 - Lee's death in his tent at Widow Leister house
2. Chapter 2: 10:47 p.m. - Longstreet is summoned, begins his long night
3. Chapter 3: The Long Night (July 1-2) - Longstreet alone with Lee's body, Davis's envelope, and the decision
4. Chapter 4: 4:12 a.m., July 2 - Longstreet opens the envelope, writes the withdrawal order: "We leave the field to the enemy, but we take the war with us"
5. Chapter 5: The Withdrawal - Army of Northern Virginia withdraws northwest, preserving itself
6. Chapter 6: The War Continues - Different trajectory without Lee, without Gettysburg's defeat
7. Chapter 7: The Path to Peace - Negotiations leading to March 31, 1865
8. Chapter 8: March 31, 1865 - Peace is signed, Confederate independence is recognized
9. Chapter 9: The Single Heartbeat - Reflection on how one moment saved the Confederacy and doomed American unity
10. Chapter 10: The Families - Fairfax and Meade families' perspectives on the divergence
11. Chapter 11: Epilogue - The match has been struck; the fire will follow
```

### Updated Breakdown (Based on Author's Intent):
```
## Chapter Breakdown
*(As a novella, this will be more focused and condensed than a full novel)*

1. Chapter 1: Night, July 1, 1863 - Lee's death on Seminary Ridge, followed by Longstreet's long night of decision-making (fretting, contemplation, and ultimately deciding to withdraw)
2. Chapter 2: Dawn, July 2, 1863 - The withdrawal begins. Army of Northern Virginia withdraws northwest, preserving itself. Opening moves of the next morning.
3. Chapter 3: The War Continues - Different trajectory without Lee, without Gettysburg's defeat
4. Chapter 4: The Path to Peace - Negotiations leading to March 31, 1865
5. Chapter 5: March 31, 1865 - Peace is signed, Confederate independence is recognized
6. Chapter 6: The Single Heartbeat - Reflection on how one moment saved the Confederacy and doomed American unity
7. Chapter 7: The Families - Fairfax and Meade families' perspectives on the divergence
8. Chapter 8: Epilogue - The match has been struck; the fire will follow
```

### Key Changes:
- **Chapter 1** now includes both Lee's death AND Longstreet's decision-making process (the "long night")
- **Chapter 2** focuses on the withdrawal and morning actions (previously Chapters 4-5 combined)
- Chapters 3-8 cover the rest of the timeline (previously Chapters 6-11, condensed)
- Removed specific timestamps (10:30 p.m., 10:47 p.m., 4:12 a.m.) from chapter titles - keeping it as "Night" and "Dawn" per author's preference
- Removed "Widow Leister house" reference - using "Seminary Ridge" instead

### Notes:
- The structure is more condensed (8 chapters instead of 11), which fits the novella format
- Chapter 1 now contains the crucial decision point (Longstreet's choice to withdraw)
- Chapter 2 shows the immediate consequences (the withdrawal itself)
- The timeline flows more naturally: death → decision → action → consequences
