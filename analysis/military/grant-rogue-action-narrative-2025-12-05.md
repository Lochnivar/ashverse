## THE SCENARIO

### **Grant's Frustration (March 1865)**

- Halleck is still General-in-Chief (ineffective, administrative only)
- Eastern theater failing (Meade, Warren, Hancock all failed)
- McClellan's peace platform (war has expiration date)
- Grant sees the war slipping away

**Grant's Realization:**
- "Halleck doesn't have the balls to do what needs to be done"
- "It's now or never - peace talks will begin soon"
- "If I don't act, no one will"
- "I'll take charge, even if I don't have the authority"

**Grant's Decision:**
- Grant acts like he has authority (but doesn't actually have it)
- Grant assembles patchwork army (65,000 men from remnants, garrisons, Western reinforcements)
- Grant launches final gamble at Appomattox
- Grant knows this is his last chance before peace talks begin
