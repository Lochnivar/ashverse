## CHAPTER 1: UNION ARMY - TO E AND OFFICERS

**Hypothetical ToE for Grant's Final Army (February 1865):**  
Grant (never promoted to general-in-chief, still Western commander, called east as last resort) assembles ~65,000 men via "legal fiction" – old orders + personal loyalty. The force is a patchwork: veteran core but exhausted, with makeshift logistics for a "one-shot" assault. No formal corps structure—organized into ad-hoc divisions for speed.

**Overall Structure:**  
- Total Strength: ~65,000 men (45,000 infantry, 15,000 cavalry/artillery, 5,000 support)  
- Command: General Ulysses S. Grant (overall command, despite relief; rogue action)  
- Equipment: Standard Union kit (Springfield rifles, Parrott guns), but short on ammunition/supplies (desperate gamble).  

**Key Divisions:**  
1. **Infantry Division A (15,000 men):** Veteran Potomac troops. Rifles, bayonets, limited artillery.  
2. **Infantry Division B (15,000 men):** Western reinforcements (Illinois/Indiana regiments). Similar kit.  
3. **Infantry Division C (15,000 men):** Garrison mix (New York/Pennsylvania). Less experienced.  
4. **Cavalry/Artillery Brigade (15,000 men):** Horse artillery, scouts. Key for feints (but none used).  

**Cast of Officers:**  
- **General Ulysses S. Grant:** Overall command. Desperate, acts via "legal fiction" – "Halleck doesn't have the balls. It's now or never."  
- **Major General Philip Sheridan:** Cavalry commander. Aggressive scout – "Ride like hell and cut their rails."  
- **Major General Gouverneur K. Warren:** Infantry lead. Cautious engineer – "This is suicide, but orders are orders."  
- **Brigadier General George A. Custer:** Cavalry brigade. Glory-hunter – "One last charge for the books."  
- **Colonel Frank A. Haskell:** Staff officer (witness). Cynical observer – "We're marching to our own funeral."  

**Narrative Hook:** Grant's patchwork army is a desperate mob – veterans mixed with green garrison troops, all knowing this is the final gamble.

## CHAPTER 2: CONFEDERATE ARMY - TO E AND OFFICERS

**Hypothetical ToE for Longstreet's Army of Northern Virginia (February 1865):**  
Longstreet's ~48,000 men are rested, re-armed from Pennsylvania raid, and dug-in. Formal corps structure maintained for defense. Longstreet knows Grant is coming – expects the desperate gamble.

**Overall Structure:**  
- Total Strength: ~48,000 men (35,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry/artillery, 3,000 support)  
- Command: General James Longstreet (overall command)  
- Equipment: Mix of captured Union rifles/artillery + British imports (post-Harrisburg resupply). Prepared positions with trenches.

**Key Corps/Divisions:**  
1. **First Corps (15,000 men):** Veteran infantry. Enfield/ Springfield rifles, field artillery.  
2. **Second Corps (15,000 men):** Mixed veterans/recruits. Similar kit.  
3. **Third Corps (10,000 men):** Cavalry/artillery heavy. Horse artillery for counter-attacks.  
4. **Reserve Brigade (8,000 men):** Home guard reinforcements.  

**Cast of Officers:**  
- **General James Longstreet:** Overall command. Defensive genius – "Let them come to us; the ground will do the killing."  
- **Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell:** Corps commander. Aggressive defender – "Hold the line like it’s Seminary Ridge."  
- **Major General George E. Pickett:** Division lead. Glory-seeker – "One last charge to end it."  
- **Brigadier General John B. Gordon:** Cavalry brigade. Charismatic fighter – "Ride them down before they reach the trenches."  
- **Major John Walter Fairfax:** Staff officer (witness). Aristocratic observer – "This is the final act; let us make it glorious."  

**Narrative Hook:** Longstreet's army is prepared, fortified, and motivated – "We won at Harrisburg; we’ll win here too."

## CHAPTER 3: THE BATTLE OF APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE

**Narrative Summary (February 18-20, 1865):**  
Grant launches his desperate gamble – 65,000 men straight at Richmond. Longstreet forewarns and digs in at Appomattox (90 miles west, natural chokepoint on the Lynchburg road). Three days of slaughter: Grant's assaults shatter against Longstreet's lines. Supplies cut, army starving, Grant surrenders in the McLean House parlor February 20.

**Key Beats:**  
- **Day 1 (February 18):** Grant arrives; initial assaults repulsed. "The ground runs red."  
- **Day 2 (February 19):** Continuous attacks; Gordon's cavalry cuts Grant's rear. "No food, no ammo, no hope."  
- **Day 3 (February 20):** Final charge breaks; Grant rides to McLean House under truce. Surrender signed at 10:17 a.m.  
- **Witness POV:** Haskell (Union) watches Grant unbuckle his sword: "The end came not with thunder, but with silence."  
- **Fairfax (CSA):** "We won the war in Pennsylvania; we ended it in Virginia."  

**Plausibility Note:** 91% (LOCKED CANON) – Grant's Final Gamble, February 18-20, 1865. Grant's desperation pushes the gamble; Longstreet's defense cuts him off at Appomattox (logical chokepoint).

**Locked.**  
Appomattox Court House: site of Grant's surrender, February 20, 1865.  
The war ends where, in another timeline, it ended for the other side.
