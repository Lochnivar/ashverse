# Analysis Folder

**Purpose:** Working analyses and research documents (pre-lock)

**Status:** Analysis documents are working documents. Once approved and locked, the locked content is transcribed into appropriate `/world-building/` files.

## Structure

### `/analysis/military/`
Military and tactical analyses:
- Northern Collapse Sequence analysis
- Grant's Final Gamble analyses
- Atlanta Campaign timeline analysis
- Sherman's March to Appomattox analysis
- Appomattox College concept analysis

**Locked Content Location:** 
- Timelines → `/world-building-master/06-timelines.md`
- Sequences → Consolidated into `/world-building-master/06-timelines.md`

### `/analysis/economic/`
Economic analyses:
- Slavery death mechanics analysis
- Economic impact refinements
- Great Depression NTL analysis
- Roaring Twenties NTL analysis

**Locked Content Location:** 
- Slavery mechanics → `/world-building-master/02-economic-systems.md`
- Economic systems → `/world-building-master/02-economic-systems.md`

### `/analysis/political/`
Political analyses:
- Presidential timeline analyses
- Political system plausibility analyses
- Treaty analyses
- Cross-border impact analyses

**Locked Content Location:** 
- Presidential lists → `/world-building-master/03-political-systems.md`
- Treaties → Consolidated into `/world-building-master/03-political-systems.md`

### `/analysis/consistency/`
Consistency checks and plausibility audits:
- Project-wide consistency checks
- Plausibility audits
- Cross-reference verification

**Locked Content Location:** 
- Consistency fixes → Integrated into relevant `/world-building/` files

### `/analysis/otl-divergence/`
OTL vs NTL comparison analyses:
- OTL events that never happen in NTL
- Verification analyses
- Divergence tracking

**Locked Content Location:** 
- OTL events list → `/world-building-master/08-reference-data.md`

## Workflow

1. **Analysis Phase:** Create analysis document in appropriate `/analysis/[category]/` folder
2. **Review & Approval:** User reviews analysis
3. **Lock & Transcribe:** Once approved, locked content transcribed into appropriate `/world-building/` file
4. **Reference:** Analysis file remains in `/analysis/` as reference/justification

---

## File Naming Convention

Analysis files use descriptive names with dates:
- `[topic]-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `[topic]-timeline-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `[topic]-consistency-check-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Locked files in `/world-building/` use descriptive names without "analysis" tags:
- `atlanta-campaign-1864-1865.md` (not `atlanta-campaign-analysis.md`)

---

## Key Principle

**Analysis files are working documents. Locked canon goes in `/world-building/`.**
