During her first review she wrote:

I have taken the liberty of replacing it with the correct citation. You're welcome. ♡ — C.B.O."

The General's reply (hand-written in margin, preserved under glass):

> "MISS OSWALD IS NOT, REPEAT NOT, MY NIECE.  
> 
> SHE IS A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR MADE FLESH."

## Locked Exchange (1935, now framed in the library)

**Claudette:**  
"Uncle Michael, your claim that California 'accidentally invented tolerance' is charming, but the 1892 San Francisco race-riot statistics rather disagree."

**General (in red ink):**  
"THEY WERE NOT RIOTS. THEY WERE 'SPIRITED CIVIC DISCUSSIONS.'  
ALSO YOU ARE NOT MY NIECE."

**Auto (tiny note in corner):**  
"She's right about the statistics, sir. I checked. Twice."

## The Sacred Typewriter Clause (Updated)

**LOCKED CANON - UPDATED VERSION**

From the compendium's front matter, footnote 3 (updated to include Claudette):

> "The General's 1937 Underwood Standard, upon which every sacred manuscript is personally hammered out, is hereby declared **off-limits** to all research and archival assistants.  
> 
> Neither Mr. Kronvoldt nor the Archival Assistant (commonly known as "Auto") is ever permitted to lay a finger upon its hallowed keys.  
> 
> **Exception:** Miss Claudette Beatrice Oswald, in her capacity as External Peer-Review Fellow, is granted **permission** to touch the sacred typewriter when conducting her independent reviews. This exception is made under protest by the General, who has been heard to remark that 'the Board of Regents has weaponized typography against me.'  
> 
> This rule is not a matter of trust; it is a matter of **ritual purity**.  
> 
> The General has been heard to remark that he would sooner allow a Yankee cavalry raid through his study than permit a subordinate's hands to profane the instrument that has produced seventeen volumes of unassailable truth (and one small pamphlet on the moral failings of Woodrow Wilson).  
> 
> Accordingly, all corrections, marginalia, and emergency whisky deliveries must be tendered in handwritten form and placed upon the silver tray provided for that purpose.  
> 
> The typewriter remains, as it has since 1937, **the General's alone** (except when Miss Oswald is conducting her reviews, which the General accepts with visible reluctance)."

**Signed:**  
G. R. O. Kronvoldt, M.Litt. (Oxon.), etc.  
A. U. T. Oswald ("Auto")  
C. B. Oswald (with a little heart ♡)

**Note:** This is a nod to the project's "Golden Rule" - the staffers (AI assistants) never touch the original creative work (the books), only work in supporting roles (the edits/compendium). The sacred typewriter represents the original manuscripts (the books folder), and the staffers can only provide handwritten notes on a silver tray (the edits folder). Claudette represents external peer review - she can touch the typewriter with permission (like external reviewers can review the work), but the General still maintains control. The Golden Rule lives in 1985 diegetic form. **Never to be violated.**

---

## Current Status (1939)

- **Still on contract** - The Board of Regents refuses to let her go
- **Still the only person allowed to touch the sacred typewriter with permission** - The General accepts this with visible reluctance
- **Still signs every report with a little heart** - Drives the General to distraction
- **Still makes the General check his footnotes twice** - The footnotes have never been safer

---

## The 1985 Compendium

### How Claudette Appears

**In Peer-Review Reports:**
- "Miss Oswald's review notes that..."
- "As corrected by the External Peer-Review Fellow..."
- "The Inquisitor has verified..."

**In Acknowledgments:**
- "I am indebted to Miss Claudette Beatrice Oswald, M.A. (Cantab.), D.Phil. (Heidelberg), External Peer-Review Fellow, for her terrifyingly thorough reviews, her perky corrections, and for making me check my footnotes twice. The footnotes have never been safer. Also, she is NOT my niece."

**In Character:**
- Claudette's voice appears in peer-review reports
- Her perky thoroughness provides perfect contrast to Fairfax-Lockwood's venom
- Her corrections ensure academic rigor
- Her "Uncle Michael" comments drive the General to distraction

---

## Examples of Claudette's Voice

### Example 1: First Review (1927)

> "While the General's prose remains, as ever, a national treasure, one is compelled to note that footnote 319 cites a source that appears to have been invented between the second and third glass of the 1898 rye. I have taken the liberty of replacing it with the correct citation. You're welcome. ♡ — C.B.O."

### Example 2: California Tolerance Claim (1935)

> "Uncle Michael, your claim that California 'accidentally invented tolerance' is charming, but the 1892 San Francisco race-riot statistics rather disagree. I have attached the relevant data. Also, I've corrected footnote 847 - you cited the wrong year for the Treaty of San Francisco. Love, Claudette. ♡"

### Example 3: Fairfax-Lockwood Pedigree (1938)

> "On the Alleged 'Unimpeachable Clarity' of the Fairfax-Lockwood Pedigree: A Re-Examination.  
> 
> While the General's family records are indeed admirably organized, one must note that the 1843 land patent he cites in footnote 1,247 appears to have been signed by a clerk who died in 1839. I have located the correct patent. You're welcome, Uncle Michael. ♡ — C.B.O."

## Notes

- **Author's Intent:** Claudette Beatrice Oswald represents external peer review - the independent reviewers who check academic work for accuracy and rigor. She is the author's humorous way of acknowledging the importance of external review while maintaining the satirical tone of the compendium.

### **Author's Acknowledgement Method**

**Purpose:** This is the author's unorthodox and humorous way of acknowledging external peer review contributions to the AshVerse project. Rather than a simple "I used external peer review" acknowledgement, the author has chosen to give credit through a satirical fictional character that fits the tone and style of the compendium. This approach is:
- **Unorthodox:** Not a traditional acknowledgement
- **Humorous:** Fits the satirical academic framing of the compendium
- **More interesting:** Creates a memorable, character-driven way to acknowledge contributions
- **Thematically appropriate:** The satirical academic voice of the compendium makes this form of acknowledgement perfectly in-character

**Note:** Claudette serves the same purpose as Kronvoldt (Grok) and Auto (Cursor/Auto) - she is the author's creative, character-driven way of giving credit to external peer review, while maintaining the satirical tone of the compendium.

- **Character Arc:** None needed - Claudette is a perfect supporting character for Fairfax-Lockwood
- **Academic Voice:** Perky, excitable, terrifyingly thorough, speaks in perfect paragraphs with footnotes
- **Humor Style:** Perky thoroughness - the cheerful foil to Fairfax-Lockwood's venom
- **Key Principle:** Claudette never breaks character - completely serious about peer review, which makes her perky corrections funnier
- **Meta-Framing Device:** Claudette Beatrice Oswald is a fictional character who "reviews" the compendium - she does NOT appear in the actual novels, only as the compendium's external peer-reviewer
- **Not In-Story:** She is not part of the narrative timeline (1863-1939) - she exists only as a meta-framing device for the companion book
- **Perfect Balance:** Provides the independent peer review that ensures academic rigor, while her perky personality provides perfect contrast to Fairfax-Lockwood's venom
- **Name Reference:** Often referred to as "The Inquisitor" by the staff, but full name is "Claudette Beatrice Oswald" (C.B.O.)
