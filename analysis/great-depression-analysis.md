# Great Depression NTL: Plausibility Analysis

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Topic:** Great Depression in NTL (1929-1939)

## ANALYSIS ASSUMPTION TESTED

**Primary Assumption:** Great Depression occurs in NTL, but differs from OTL due to three-nation structure and different boom patterns

**Sub-Assumptions:**
- Each nation experiences crisis differently
- Timing and severity vary by nation
- Different triggers for each nation
- No unified speculative bubble to burst

## PARAMETERS

**Key Variables:**
- Timeframe: 1929-1939 (OTL depression period)
- Nations: USA, CSA, California (three separate economies)
- OTL causes: Stock crash, banking collapse, agricultural overproduction, trade collapse, monetary failures, structural weaknesses
- NTL differences: Three-nation structure, different boom patterns, different economic structures

**Historical Context:**
- OTL: Unified economy, massive depression 1929-1933
- NTL: Three separate economies, different structures
- Precedent: OTL depression patterns

**Constraints:**
- Must account for three-nation structure
- Must maintain historical plausibility
- Must serve narrative function
- Must align with established economic systems

## RESULTS

**Overall Plausibility Score: 85%** (Very Strong)

**Key Findings:**

**USA: "The Flickering Twenties" Collapse (1929-1933)**
- Stock market crash (less severe than OTL - no unified bubble)
- Banking collapse (regional, not national)
- Industrial overproduction (factories idle since WWI)
- **Plausibility: 83%** - Realistic given "Flickering Twenties" setup

**CSA: Agricultural Crisis (1930-1935)**
- Agricultural overproduction
- Trade war with USA (Long vs Watson)
- Rural bank failures
- **Plausibility: 87%** - Agricultural crisis realistic

**California: Oil Revenue Buffer (1929-1939)**
- Less severe impact (oil revenue buffer)
- Trade disruption affects exports
- But oil demand relatively inelastic
- **Plausibility: 88%** - Oil revenue provides buffer

**Breakdown:**
- Historical Precedent: 88% (OTL depression patterns applicable)
- Economic Realism: 85% (Three-nation structure creates differences)
- Narrative Function: 82% (Serves story, creates tension)
- Timing Plausibility: 85% (Different timing realistic)

**Key Differences from OTL:**
- ✅ Less unified crisis (three separate economies)
- ✅ Different timing (USA 1929-1933, CSA 1930-1935, California less severe)
- ✅ Different triggers (USA industrial, CSA agricultural, California trade disruption)
- ✅ No unified speculative bubble (less severe stock crash)

## CAVEATS

**Assumptions Required:**
- Three-nation structure creates different crisis patterns - **Justification:** Realistic given separate economies
- Trade war triggers CSA crisis - **Justification:** Aligns with established timeline (Long vs Watson)
- Oil revenue buffers California - **Justification:** Realistic given oil reserves

**Limitations:**
- Less dramatic than OTL depression
- Requires accepting different timing
- Economic interactions between nations need careful justification

**Edge Cases:**
- What if crisis is more unified? → **Not tested:** Assumes three-nation differences
- What if crisis doesn't happen? → **Not tested:** Assumes crisis occurs

## FINAL RESULT

**Plausibility Score: 85%** (Very Strong)  
**Status:** ✅ **LOCKED CANON**

**Justification:** Realistic given three-nation structure. Different timing and triggers plausible. Less dramatic than OTL but serves narrative function. Aligns with "Flickering Twenties" setup.
