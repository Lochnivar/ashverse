# California's Path to Independence

## The Geographic Reality (1865)

California in 1865 is already a U.S. state (admitted 1850), overwhelmingly Union-loyal, but **physically cut off** from the rest of the United States by:

- **Sovereign Native super-states** (Dakota, Comanchería, etc.) in the Great Plains
- **The CSA** controlling everything from Arkansas/Texas westward to the Colorado River in some places
- **Mormon Deseret republic** (if kept sovereign) blocking the northern route

**There is no land bridge left.**

## Timeline of California's Evolution

### 1865–1880: Loyal but Distant U.S. State
- **Political status:** Loyal but **distant** U.S. state
- **How it survives:** Sea mail only, 30–40 days from Washington. No land connection = de-facto autonomy from day one.
- **Realism check:** 10/10

### 1880–1900: Economic Powerhouse Realization
- **Political status:** Still U.S. state, but growing awareness of economic power
- **What happens:** Transcontinental railroad finally built (joint U.S./Native/Deseret project). California realizes it's now the **economic powerhouse** of the continent (gold, then oil, then ports).
- **Key question:** "Why are we sending our taxes east?"
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### 1900–1925: Quiet Independence Building
- **Political status:** Growing de-facto independence
- **What happens:** California quietly builds its own navy (Pacific Fleet never leaves after 1898 Spanish-American War analogue). Starts signing its own trade deals with Japan, China, Britain.
- **Why it works:** Washington is too weak and war-weary to say no.
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### 1926–1930: The Referendum
- **Political status:** Moving toward independence
- **What happens:** California Republic referendum: **68% yes** to peaceful independence, citing "the precedent of 1861" (the South's secession).
- **Why it works:** The North has no army within 1,500 miles, no political will for another civil war, and needs California's ports for trade.
- **Realism check:** 9/10

### 1931: Treaty of San Francisco
- **Political status:** Fully independent **Republic of California**
- **What happens:** Treaty of San Francisco – California leaves the Union. U.S. keeps military bases under 99-year lease (think post-WWII Iceland or Azores).
- **The vibe:** Amicable divorce. Both sides shake hands and get rich together.
- **Realism check:** 10/10

### 1931–2025: Independent Republic
- **Political status:** Fully independent Republic of California
- **Characteristics:** Rich, neutral, Singapore-with-redwoods, speaks English with a Spanish accent
- **Relationship with U.S.:** Like post-independence Ireland treats Britain — family, but not the same house
- **Realism check:** 9/10

## Why the North Lets It Happen Without Firing a Shot

1. **Geography** – no land corridor, no way to march an army there.
2. **Money** – California is already bankrolling half the remaining U.S. debt with gold/oil/port fees. War would bankrupt the North instantly.
3. **Precedent** – the South already proved secession is legal when you win. California just does it **cleaner**.
4. **Public opinion** – after the 1861–65 bloodbath, no Northerner wants to die for "keeping the Pacific coast in the Union."

## Oregon and Washington Stay U.S.

**Important:** California does **not** take Oregon and Washington with it when it leaves.

### Why Oregon/Washington Don't Follow California

1. **Different migration streams** – Oregon Trail settlers were overwhelmingly Midwestern Yankees who hated slavery and the South.
2. **Economic ties** – their natural trade is down the Columbia River and north to British Columbia, not south to San Francisco.
3. **Military reality** – after California goes independent, the U.S. **needs** Puget Sound naval bases (Bremerton) and Portland's port. They'll fight to keep them.
4. **Cultural identity** – Pacific Northwest develops its own "rain-soaked, lumberjack, Scandinavian-socialist" identity separate from California's "sun-drenched gold-rush" culture.

### Outcome

When California secedes, Oregon and Washington **stay in the Union** but become the U.S.'s **semi-autonomous Pacific frontier** — heavily militarized, rich from timber/shipping/tech, and quietly resentful of East-Coast meddling but never quite willing to burn the bridge.

## The "Good Riddance" Dynamic

By the 1920s–1930s, the dynamic is less "California bravely declares independence" and more **"California, please, for the love of God, take your movie stars and leave"** from the rest of the fractured U.S.

### Who Wants California Gone

- **Oregon & Washington:** Tired of San Francisco treating the Columbia River like its private shipping lane and Portland like a suburb.
- **The remaining U.S. (East Coast):** California sends almost no taxes east anymore anyway, but still demands federal navy protection and screams when it doesn't get it.
- **Native super-states:** Prefer one big, predictable neighbour to the south-west over a sprawling, land-hungry U.S. that keeps eyeing the Plains.
- **The CSA:** Happy to see the North lose its richest chunk of its economy and its only real Pacific ports.

### The Divorce

By the time the referendum happens (say, 1932), the rest of the continent is basically holding the door open and saying:

**"Here's your hat, here's your coat, don't let the Golden Gate hit you on the way out."**

California thinks it's a triumphant declaration of independence. Everyone else treats it like a long-overdue eviction.

Joint press release, 1933:

**"The United States and the Republic of California have agreed to a peaceful and mutually beneficial separation, effective 1 January 1934. Both nations look forward to a continued close relationship."**

Translation from the U.S. side, whispered in every bar from Seattle to Boston:

**"Good riddance, you insufferable rich bastards. Don't call us, we'll call you."**

No shots fired. No hard feelings (officially). Just the quietest, pettiest, most lucrative break-up in history.

## The North America Equivalent of Australia

California ends up as the **North America equivalent of Australia**:
- Started as a loyal colony
- Grew too rich and too far away
- Quietly became its own thing while still waving the old flag when convenient

## Characteristics

- **No land bridge. Sea and air only.**
- **Rich, smug, and increasingly its own country.**
- **The U.S.'s golden exclave that slowly turns into a Pacific superpower in all but name.**

## Notes

This is not a dramatic secession. It's a gradual drift born of geographic necessity. California doesn't rebel—it just drifts away, becoming too rich, too isolated, and too independent to be effectively controlled from Washington.

By 1920, it's the Republic of California in all but name, and by the time of The Ashes (1939), it's a fully independent Pacific power.
